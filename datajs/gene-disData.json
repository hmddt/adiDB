    "abstract": "Association between the 45T/G and 276G/T single nucleotide polymorphisms of adiponectin gene and the occurrence of type 2 diabetes in Chinese population was studied. 20 studies consisting 22 case-control comparisons about 45T/G polymorphism and nine case-control studies about 276G/T polymorphism that were based on our inclusion criterion and available in the literature were reviewed. Results from Meta-analysis demonstrated a large heterogeneity among the studies both on 45T/G and 276G/T polymorphisms and a significant association was observed between 45T/G polymorphism at exon 2 of the adiponectin gene and type 2 diabetes among the Chinese population.45G allele appeared to be one of the genetic risk factors for susceptibility to type 2 diabetes with a random effects odds ratio (OR) of 1.43 (95%CI: 1.17 - 1.75), and the G allele carriers were more susceptible to the disease with an OR of 1.38 (95%CI: 1.04 - 1.84). Results from Meta-analysis, however, showed no association between the 276G/T polymorphism and type 2 diabetes in the Chinese population, while the random effects OR of the allele 276T to susceptibility of disease was 0.83 (95%CI: 0.61 - 1.13). The current paper on Meta-analysis demonstrated a correlation between the 45T/G single nucleotide polymorphism and the occurrence of type 2 diabetes in Chinese population, which was different from the findings that such an association with 276G/T polymorphism could not be demonstrated in the same ethnic population.",

    "title": "Association of 1-y changes in diet pattern with cardiovascular disease risk factors and adipokines: results from the 1-y randomized Oslo Diet and Exercise Study.",
    "abstract": "We hypothesized that favorable changes in dietary patterns would lead to a reduction in body size and an improvement in metabolic status. The objective was to study changes in diet patterns relative to changes in body size, blood pressure, and circulating concentrations of lipids, glucose, insulin, adiponectin, and other cytokines in the context of a 1-y randomized intervention study. For 1 y, 187 men aged 45 +/- 2 y, approximately 50% of whom met the criteria of the metabolic syndrome, were randomly assigned to a diet protocol (n = 45), an exercise protocol (n = 48), a protocol of diet plus exercise (n = 58), or a control protocol (n = 36). A previously defined a priori diet score was created by summing tertile rankings of 35 food group variables; a higher score generally reflected recommended dietary changes in the trial (mean +/- SD at baseline: 31 +/- 6.5; range: 15-47). Over the study year, the diet score increased by approximately 2 +/- 5.5 in both diet groups, with a decrease of an equivalent amount in the exercise and control groups. The weight change was -3.5 +/- 0.6 kg/10-point change in diet score (P &lt; 0.0001), similarly within each intervention group, independently of the change in energy intake or baseline age and smoking status. Weight change was attenuated but remained significant after adjustment for intervention group and percentage body fat. Subjects with an increased diet score had more favorable changes in other body size variables, systolic blood pressure, and blood lipid, glucose, insulin, and adiponectin concentrations. Change in diet score was unrelated to resistin and several cytokines. The change toward a more favorable diet pattern was associated with improved body size and metabolic profile.",

    "abstract": "Pioglitazone has a preventive effect on cardiovascular disease, but its ability to stabilize coronary plaque is unknown. A prospective, randomized trial was conducted in 54 patients with type 2 diabetes and stable angina pectoris, randomly assigned to either a pioglitazone group or control group. Non-culprit, angiographically mild-to-moderate obstructive lesions were examined with virtual histology intravascular ultrasound (VH-IVUS) at coronary intervention and 6 months later. In total, 42 lesions of 22 patients in the pioglitazone group and 44 lesions of 24 patients in the control group were analyzed. After 6 months, patients in the pioglitazone group had significantly improved blood sugar, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and plasma adiponectin levels. VH-IVUS analysis revealed that, although the total plaque-to-vessel volume was not changed in either group, the necrotic-core area had significantly decreased in the pioglitazone group (-4.6+/-5.9% vs 1.1+/-9.3%, P=0.001). There was a significant inverse correlation between the change in plasma adiponectin levels and the change in necrotic-core area (r=-0.46, P&lt;0.0001). Pioglitazone may stabilize coronary plaque by reducing the necrotic-core component, in association with enhanced plasma adiponectin levels.",

    "abstract": "To compare the short-term effect of treatment with atorvastatin and rosuvastatin on levels of serum lipids, inflammatory markers and adiponectin in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Sixty-nine patients with hypercholesterolemia were randomly assigned to receive 10 mg/day of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin for 12 weeks. Inflammatory biomarkers, including highsensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and endothelin (ET-1), plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) and plasma tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), adiponectin, and lipid profiles were measured before and after statin therapy. Atorvastatin and rosuvastatin both lowered levels of hs-CRP, MMP-9, PAI-1, total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) from baseline values, with rosuvastatin lowering TC and LDL-C to a greater extent than atorvastatin (P &lt; 0.05). Adiponectin level increase was 15% higher than that at baseline with atorvastatin (P &gt; 0.05) but 67% higher with rosuvastatin (P &lt; 0.05). Therapy with both statins not only significantly improved lipid profiles but also decreased levels of vascular biomarkers hs-CRP, MMP-9, and PAI-1; however, only rosuvastatin increased serum adiponectin levels significantly in patients with hypercholesterolemia, which could imply a beneficial effect in coronary artery disease.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the relationships between plasma leptin and adiponectin levels and recurrent cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke) in men with earlier acute coronary syndromes. A nested case-control study examined circulating leptin and adiponectin levels in plasma obtained 4-6 years after entry into the Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease (LIPID) trial. Plasma was assayed from 184 men who suffered recurrent events within 4.4 years after blood collection and 184 matched controls who remained free of further events. The association between cardiovascular events and the explanatory variables was examined by conditional logistic regression analysis. Relative risk (RR) increased across increasing leptin quartiles; the highest quartile compared with the lowest quartile was related to the highest risk (P for trend=0.002); the increased risk remained after adjustment for risk factors (P=0.018) or for obesity (P=0.038), but in the final model (adjusted for randomized treatment, other drugs, LIPID risk score, age and body mass index), the risk was attenuated (RR=1.61, 95% CI: 0.72-3.57, P for trend=0.34). Adiponectin did not predict cardiovascular events. Subjects randomly allocated to pravastatin had 6% lower leptin levels (P=0.04) than those allocated to placebo. Plasma leptin was a significant and independent predictor of recurrent cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke) in men with earlier acute coronary syndromes.",

    "abstract": "Postmenopausal phase expresses many unfavourable physiological changes that lead to increased risk for cardiovascular disease. We compared the effect of two sympatholytic antihypertensive drug treatments, the centrally acting imidazoline receptor-1 agonist moxonidine and peripherally acting beta-blocking agent atenolol on sensitive inflammatory markers in overweight postmenopausal women with diastolic hypertension. This was a multicentre, multinational double-blinded, prospective study comparing moxonidine (0.3 mg twice daily) with atenolol (50 mg once daily) in 87 hypertensive postmenopausal overweight women who were not taking hormone therapy. Sensitive C-reactive protein, IL-6, TNFalpha, TNFalpha-RII and adiponectin were determined in the beginning of the study and after 8 weeks of medical treatment. TNFalpha increased in atenolol and decreased in moxonidine group (P = 0.0004 between the groups). Adiponectin concentration decreased dramatically in atenonol but did not change in moxonidine treatment group (P &lt; 0.0001 between the groups). In logistic regression analysis only treatment group showed an independent effect on changes in adiponectin and TNFalpha concentrations. We believe that centrally acting sympatholytic agent moxonidine is beneficial in the treatment of postmenopausal women with hypertension by reducing inflammatory cytokine TNFalpha without changing protective adiponectin level.",

The latter associations have not been well evaluated prospectively in adults commencing antiretroviral therapy. We studied the effects of protease inhibitor-based antiretroviral regimens on body composition, insulin sensitivity and adipocytokine levels. 48-week substudy of a randomized, open-label, three-arm trial. Hospital and community HIV clinics. 140 HIV-infected adults naive to antiretroviral therapy.

Body composition [dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry for limb fat; L4, abdominal computed tomography for visceral adipose tissue (VAT)]; and fasting metabolic parameters. The primary analysis was change in limb fat mass in each TPV/r group vs. LPV/r. Limb fat increased in all three groups: LPV/r (1.17 kg) versus TPV/r200 (0.83 kg; P = 0.16) and TPV/r100 (0.41 kg; P = 0.07). VAT decreased in all groups: LPV/r (-3 cm) vs. TPV/r200 (-9 cm; P = 0.04) and TPV/r100 (-6 cm; P = 0.40). No significant change in insulin sensitivity was observed, including by oral glucose tolerance testing. The increase in leptin levels was significantly correlated with the increase in limb fat mass (r = 0.67; P &lt; 0.0001). Despite increased limb fat, adiponectin levels increased, but significantly more with TPV/r200 (+6010 ng/ml; P &lt; 0.0001) or TPV/r100 (+4497 ng/ml; P = 0.002) when compared with LPV/r (+1360 ng/ml).

    "title": "Losartan elevates the serum high-molecular weight-adiponectin isoform and concurrently improves insulin sensitivity in patients with impaired glucose metabolism.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin is an adipocyte hormone that ameliorates insulin resistance and prevents diabetes. Patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) are at a high risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Since treatment with angiotensin II receptor blockers retards the development of diabetes, the effects of losartan on serum adiponectin levels were examined with regard to insulin sensitivity in pre-diabetic patients. Sixty-five patients with IFG/IGT (42 males, 23 females, 63+/-13 years old) were randomized to receive 25-100 mg of losartan (n=33) or a calcium channel blocker (CCB, n=32) for 3 months. Before and after the treatment, changes in blood pressure, insulin sensitivity (HOMA-R) and serum concentrations of high molecular weight (HMW)-adiponectin and free fatty acid (FFA) were assessed. At baseline, the HMW-adiponectin concentration negatively correlated with the patient's body mass index, HOMA-R and triglyceride levels, and positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels. However, the HMW-adiponectin concentration showed no correlation with blood pressure. HMW-adiponectin concentrations were similar between the losartan group and the CCB group. Both the losartan and CCB treatments similarly and significantly reduced the mean blood pressure (107+/-7 mmHg to 95+/-7 mmHg, p&lt;0.0001, and 104+/-6 mmHg to 93+/-9 mmHg, p&lt;0.0001, respectively). Losartan treatment resulted in a significant increase in HMW-adiponectin concentrations (45.9%) and a significant decrease in HOMA-R (23.9%) and FFA concentrations (26.5%); the percent changes were greater than those induced by CCB treatment (p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.01, respectively). We conclude that losartan increases the serum HMW-adiponectin concentration and concurrently improves insulin sensitivity in subjects with IFG/IGT. These results suggest that losartan may prevent diabetes by increasing serum adiponectin levels.",

    "abstract": "The effects of thiazolidinediones on cardiac function are controversial in humans with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and in animals. Given the high prevalence and prognostic relevance of diastolic myocardial dysfunction in T2DM, we tested the hypothesis that by reducing oxidative stress rosiglitazone, but not glimepiride, may improve diastolic function. This randomised cross-over study investigated 12 metformin-treated T2DM patients without cardiovascular disease before and after 16 weeks of additional therapy with rosiglitazone (8 mg daily) or glimepiride (3 mg daily). Systolic and diastolic myocardial velocity (E') were assessed with tissue Doppler. In spite of similar non-significant lowering of glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1C), rosiglitazone, but not glimepiride, significantly improved E' (p=0.04), reduced malondialdehyde (p=0.028), lowered high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) (p=0.019), and increased adiponectin (p=0.002). For rosiglitazone, multivariate regression analysis revealed malondialdehyde reduction as an independent determinant of treatment-induced improvement in E'. The rosiglitazone-induced improvements of diastolic function and oxidative stress may be of prognostic relevance in choosing therapy for T2DM patients without overt heart disease.",

    "abstract": "The effects of estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) to cardiovascular disease risk are still unclear. Low adiponectin and high resistin plasma concentrations are reported to be associated with atherosclerosis. However, it is not known how ERT affects plasma adiponectin and resistin concentrations. Seventy-three hysterectomized, nondiabetic, postmenopausal women were randomized in a double-blind, double-dummy study to receive either peroral estradiol valerate or transdermal 17beta-estradiol gel for 6 months. Biochemical measurements were determined from samples taken before and after the therapy. Peroral estradiol valerate therapy decreased adiponectin concentrations from 13.6 to 11.6 mg/L (P = .008), whereas transdermal 17beta-estradiol gel had no effect (12.7 vs 12.2 mg/L). Neither treatment changed the resistin concentrations significantly. Plasma concentrations of estradiol and estrone did not correlate with adiponectin or resistin concentrations before or after therapy. The change in adiponectin concentration correlated significantly with the changes in waist-hip ratio, very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides, and insulin-like growth factor 1 in the peroral estradiol valerate group. The changes in these variables and the change in estradiol concentration explained 43.1% (P = .001) of the variability in the change of plasma adiponectin, the change in very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides being the strongest determinant (beta = -.407, P = .011). The results show that peroral ERT can decrease plasma adiponectin levels. However, ERT does not seem to influence plasma resistin concentrations.",

    "abstract": "Insulin resistance is a major feature of type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Several studies pointed out the possible role of increased leptin in NAFLD in humans. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of metformin on plasma leptin levels in obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and NAFLD compared with lifestyle interventions. Thirty-four obese patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus were prospectively followed for 6 months. All patients had ultrasonographic evidence of NAFLD at baseline. The patients were randomized into two groups: group 1 (n = 15) followed lifestyle changes only and group 2 (n = 19) received metformin (1,700 mg/day). At the end of treatment, BMI, WHR, HbA1c, fasting glucose, leptin, HOMA-IR, alanine aminotransferase values decreased in both groups. No significant difference in the end-points was observed between two groups. Only in group 2, LDL decreased and HDL increased significantly. Liver echogenity decreased significantly at the end of study in both groups. The percentage of patients who no longer had evidence of NAFLD was not significantly different between the groups (20% of patients on lifestyle intervention vs. 16% of patients on metformin). The data demonstrate that, metformin and lifestyle interventions equally affected the plasma leptin levels, BMI and degree of NAFLD in obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition, the effects of metformin on the variables were not found to be mediated by leptin.",

We designed a prospective randomized study to compare a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma)-activating ARB with a nonactivating ARB to delineate the effects on metabolic factors associated with cardiovascular disease. Subjects initially comprised 153 hypertensive patients (72 men, 81 women; mean age, 67.9 +/- 7.8 years) with diagnosed glucose intolerance on the glucose loading test. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 6-month administration of telmisartan 47.0 mg/d (TEL) or candesartan 8.4 mg/d (CAN), or to have no change in drug regimen (control group, CTL). Fasting plasma glucose level was significantly reduced in TEL (n = 46) compared with CTL (n = 47) (percentage of change from baseline, -1.7% vs +2.2%; P = .045). Percentage of increase in adiponectin was significantly larger in TEL than in CTL (+10.5% vs +2.2%, P = .025), but not significantly larger in CAN (n = 44) than in CTL (+4.9% vs +2.2%; P = .13). Percentage of decrease in body weight from baseline was significantly enhanced in TEL compared with CTL (-2.2% vs -0.8%, P = .023) and CAN (-2.2% vs -0.3%, P = .007). Telmisartan decreased body weight while increasing serum adiponectin levels in hypertensive patients with glucose intolerance. Candesartan did not achieve similar improvements in these patients. Among ARBs, telmisartan may have a larger impact on obesity-related diseases that can lead to cardiovascular disorders.",

    "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) has been associated with cardiovascular disease in epidemiological and observational studies. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the treatment of choice for OSAS, but the impact of this intervention on systemic inflammation involved in the atherosclerotic process remains unclear. 100 men with moderate-severe OSAS were randomised to therapeutic (n = 51) or subtherapeutic (n = 49) CPAP treatment for 4 weeks to investigate the effects of active treatment on inflammatory markers such as highly sensitive C reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin (IL)6, interferon gamma (IFNgamma) and anti-inflammatory adiponectin. 4 weeks of therapeutic CPAP did not significantly change blood levels of hsCRP compared with the subtherapeutic control group (difference between median changes -0.24 mg/l (95% CI -0.88 to +0.24); p = 0.30). Plasma levels of IL6 and IFNgamma did not change significantly following therapeutic compared with subtherapeutic CPAP (difference between median changes +0.52 and -0.07 pg/ml (95% CI -0.72 to +1.94 and -0.81 to +0.44); p = 0.45 and p = 0.82, respectively). Furthermore, 4 weeks of therapeutic CPAP did not significantly change levels of adiponectin in plasma compared with the subtherapeutic control group (difference between median changes +0.05 pg/ml (95% CI -0.36 to +0.47); p = 0.84). If patients with hsCRP values above 8 mg/l at baseline were excluded, differences between the changes in hsCRP, IL6, IFNgamma and adiponectin after 4 weeks of CPAP were smaller, and again not statistically different between groups. 4 weeks of CPAP treatment has no beneficial effect on blood markers of inflammation and adiponectin in patients with moderate-severe obstructive sleep apnoea.",

    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a leading cause of chronic liver disease for which there is limited therapy available. Insulin sensitizing, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic properties of thiazolidinediones support their use in treating NASH. We have evaluated pioglitazone in the treatment of nondiabetic patients with NASH. We randomized 74 nondiabetic patients (45 men; median age, 54 y) with histologically proven NASH to 12 months of standard diet, exercise, and either placebo or pioglitazone (30 mg/day). Sixty-one patients (30 placebo, 31 pioglitazone) had liver biopsies both at the beginning and the end of the study. Compared with placebo, pioglitazone therapy was associated with an increase in weight (mean change, -0.55 vs +2.77 kg; P = .04) and a reduction in glucose (+0.4 vs -0.1 mmol/L; P = .02), HbA1c (+0.16% vs -0.18%; P = .006), insulin C peptide level (+42 vs -78 pmol/L; P = .02), alanine aminotransferase level (-10.9 vs -36.2 u/L; P = .009), gamma-glutamyltransferase level (-9.4 vs -41.2 u/L; P = .002), and ferritin (-11.3 vs -90.5 microg/L; P = .01). Histologic features including hepatocellular injury (P = .005), Mallory-Denk bodies (P = .004), and fibrosis (P = .05) were reduced in patients treated with pioglitazone compared with those in the placebo group. Pioglitazone therapy over a 12-month period in nondiabetic subjects with NASH resulted in improvements in metabolic and histologic parameters, most notably liver injury and fibrosis. Larger extended trials are justified to assess the long-term efficacy of pioglitazone in this patient group.",

    "abstract": "There is controversy about the effects of statins on plasma adiponectin, and the impact of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on plasma adiponectin level is still unknown. We investigated the impact of Atorvastatin on plasma adiponectin levels in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients with stable angina and normal lipid profiles after PCI. Sixty CAD patients with stable angina and normal lipid profiles scheduled for PCI, and not on statins, were randomly assigned to either no treatment (control group) or the Atorvastatin treatment (Atorvastatin group). Atorvastatin administration was started immediately after PCI. Blood samples were obtained immediately after PCI and again 3 and 6 mo later. Fasting plasma adiponectin concentrations were measured using a radioimmunoassay kit. After PCI, there were statistically significant decreases in adiponectin levels in the Atorvastatin group at 3 and 6 mo (8.66 +/- 0.69 versus 6.87 +/- 0.55 and 7.12 +/- 0.71 microg/mL at 0, 3, and 6 mo, respectively), despite the anti-inflammation and lipid-lowering effects of Atorvastatin. There were no statistically significant changes in adiponectin levels in the control group. There was significant positive association between baseline plasma adiponectin and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. Changes of adiponectin level were not associated with the changes of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and lipid profiles in the Atorvastatin group. Our study confirmed the benefits of Atorvastatin on anti-inflammation and anti-atherosclerosis, but we also found that Atorvastatin had a negative effect on the adiponectin system. The anti-inflammatory, anti-atherogenic effects of Atorvastatin are not affected by decreased adiponectin levels.",

    "abstract": "The large clinical trials proved that Basal-Bolus (BB) insulin therapy was effective in the prevention of diabetic complications and their progression. However, BB therapy needs multiple insulin injections per a day. In this regard, a biphasic insulin analogue needs only twice-daily injections, and is able to correct postprandial hyperglycemia. Therefore it may achieve the blood glucose control as same as that of BB therapy and prevent the diabetic complications including macroangiopathy. In PROBE (Prospective, Randomized, Open, Blinded-Endpoint) design, forty-two type 2 diabetic patients (male: 73.8%, median(inter quartile range) age: 64.5(56.8-71.0)years) with secondary failure of sulfonylurea (SU) were randomly assigned to BB therapy with a thrice-daily insulin aspart and once-daily basal insulin (BB group) or to conventional therapy with a twice-daily biphasic insulin analogue (30 Mix group), and were followed up for 6 months to compare changes in HbA1c, daily glycemic profile, intima-media thickness (IMT) of carotid artery, adiponectin levels, amounts of insulin used, and QOL between the two groups. After 6 months, HbA1c was significantly reduced in both groups compared to baseline (30 Mix; 9.3(8.1-11.3) --&gt; 7.4(6.9-8.7)%, p &lt; 0.01, vs BB;8.9(7.7-10.0) --&gt; 6.9(6.2-7.3)%, p &lt; 0.01), with no significant difference between the groups in percentage change in HbA1c (30 Mix; -14.7(-32.5- (-)7.5)% vs BB -17.8(-30.1- (-)11.1)%, p = 0.32). There was a significant decrease in daily glycemic profile at all points except dinner time in both groups compared to baseline. There was a significant increase in the amount of insulin used in the 30 Mix group after treatment compared to baseline (30 Mix;0.30(0.17-0.44) --&gt; 0.39(0.31-0.42) IU/kg, p = 0.01). There was no significant difference in IMT, BMI, QOL or adiponectin levels in either group compared to baseline. Both BB and 30 mix group produced comparable reductions in HbA1c in type 2 diabetic patients with secondary failure. There was no significant change in IMT as an indicator of early atherosclerotic changes between the two groups. The basal-bolus insulin therapy may not be necessarily needed if the type 2 diabetic patients have become secondary failure. Current Controlled Trials number, NCT00348231.",

    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a liver disease that complicates insulin-resistant states. This trial tested the efficacy and safety of rosiglitazone, an insulin-sensitizing agent, in patients with NASH. Sixty-three patients with histologically proven NASH were randomly assigned to receive rosiglitazone (4 mg/day for the first month and 8 mg/day thereafter; n = 32) or placebo (n = 31) for 1 year. Liver biopsy was performed at the end of treatment. End points were improvement in the histologic score of steatosis, normalization of serum transaminase levels, and improvement in necroinflammation and fibrosis. More patients treated with rosiglitazone than receiving placebo had improved steatosis (47% vs 16%; P = .014) and normalized transaminase levels (38% vs 7%; P = .005), although only half of patients responded. There was no improvement in other histologic lesions, including fibrosis, and a composite score of activity, the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score. Improvement of steatosis correlated with reduction of transaminase levels (r = 0.36; P &lt; .005), improvement in insulin sensitivity (r = 0.34; P = .008), and increase in adiponectin levels (r = -0.54; P &lt; .01) but not with weight variations. Independent predictors of response were rosiglitazone treatment, the absence of diabetes, and massive steatosis. Weight gain was the main adverse effect (mean gain of 1.5 kg in the rosiglitazone group vs -1 kg in the placebo group; P &lt; .01), and painful swollen legs was the main reason for dose reduction/discontinuation. Serum hemoglobin level was slightly but significantly reduced. There was no hepatic toxicity. In patients with NASH, rosiglitazone improves steatosis and transaminase levels despite weight gain, an effect related to an improvement in insulin sensitivity. However, there is no improvement in other parameters of liver injury.",

    "abstract": "Long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA) lower risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), but mechanisms are not well understood. We used proteomics to identify human serum proteins that are altered by n-3 LCPUFA. Such proteins could identify pathways whereby they affect CHD. Eighty-one healthy volunteers entered a double blind randomised trial to receive 3.5 g of fish oil or 3.5 g of high oleic sunflower oil daily. Serum was collected before and after 6 wk of intervention. Serum was analysed by proteomics using 2-DE. Proteins that were differentially regulated were identified by MS. We also analysed serum apolipoprotein A1 (apo A1), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particle size and haptoglobin. Serum levels of apo A1, apo L1, zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein, haptoglobin precursor, alpha-1-antitrypsin precursor, antithrombin III-like protein, serum amyloid P component and haemopexin were significantly downregulated (all p&lt;0.05) by fish oil compared with high oleic sunflower oil supplementation. Fish oil supplementation caused a significant shift towards the larger, more cholesterol-rich HDL(2) particle. The alterations in serum proteins and HDL size imply that fish oil activates anti-inflammatory and lipid modulating mechanisms believed to impede the early onset of CHD. These proteins are potential diagnostic biomarkers to assess the mechanisms whereby fish oil protects against CHD in humans.",

    "abstract": "We have reported that, compared with glucose-sweetened beverages, consuming fructose-sweetened beverages with meals results in lower 24-h circulating glucose, insulin, and leptin concentrations and elevated triacylglycerol (TG). However, pure fructose and glucose are not commonly used as sweeteners. High-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) has replaced sucrose as the predominant sweetener in beverages in the United States. We compared the metabolic/endocrine effects of HFCS with sucrose and, in a subset of subjects, with pure fructose and glucose. Thirty-four men and women consumed 3 isocaloric meals with either sucrose- or HFCS-sweetened beverages, and blood samples were collected over 24 h. Eight of the male subjects were also studied when fructose- or glucose-sweetened beverages were consumed. In 34 subjects, 24-h glucose, insulin, leptin, ghrelin, and TG profiles were similar between days that sucrose or HFCS was consumed. Postprandial TG excursions after HFCS or sucrose were larger in men than in women. In the men in whom the effects of 4 sweeteners were compared, the 24-h glucose and insulin responses induced by HFCS and sucrose were intermediate between the lower responses during consumption of fructose and the higher responses during glucose. Unexpectedly, postprandial TG profiles after HFCS or sucrose were not intermediate but comparably high as after pure fructose. Sucrose and HFCS do not have substantially different short-term endocrine/metabolic effects. In male subjects, short-term consumption of sucrose and HFCS resulted in postprandial TG responses comparable to those induced by fructose.",

    "abstract": "Several randomized clinical trials have suggested that atorvastatin and pravastatin may differ in terms of their pleiotropic effects. To verify this, we compared the effects of both statins on glucose tolerance, adipokine concentrations and inflammatory markers. A total of 36 hypercholesterolaemic patients without known coronary heart disease (CHD) were enrolled in an open-label, randomized, crossover study. The patients received pravastatin or atorvastatin (10 mg/day) for 4 months and then switched to the other statin for an additional 4 months. At the end of both treatment periods, atorvastatin significantly reduced the concentration of serum lipids (total and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and triglycerides) and inflammatory markers (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and tumour necrosis factor-a) and increased serum adiponectin levels compared with pravastatin treatment. Although these effects would be expected to improve insulin sensitivity, atorvastatin did not affect glucose tolerance, which was assessed by fasting glucose and insulin concentrations, the homeostasis model assessment index and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) levels. Only obese patients showed increased HbA(1c) levels after atorvastatin treatment. Our results suggest that atorvastatin has both advantages and disadvantages compared with pravastatin treatment. Further studies are required to compare the relative clinical value of atorvastatin and pravastatin, especially in obese patients without CHD.",

    "abstract": "Physical activity is associated with improved fibrinolytic activity and reduced risk for cardiovascular disease. High levels of leptin and low levels of adiponectin, both adipocyte-derived hormones, or adipokines, are related to dysfibrinolysis and risk for cardiovascular disease. In this study, we explored if improved fibrinolytic activity during exercise could be linked to changes in leptin and adiponectin levels. Twenty healthy men (mean age 36 years) participated in a 14-day long skiing expedition in the Swedish mountains. They were randomly assigned to either a 40% or a 30% fat-based diet. Anthropometry, lipids, fibrinolytic activity (PAI-1 activity, tPA activity and mass) and adipokines (leptin and adiponectin) were measured before, during and six weeks after the expedition. PAI-1 activity and circulating levels of leptin decreased whereas levels of adiponectin increased during exercise. The fall in PAI-1 activity showed a strong linear association with changes in leptin and adiponectin levels (p = 0.001 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively). Changes in leptin and adiponectin levels were independent of decreasing waist circumference. However, the association between anthropometric measures and adipokines changed considerably during the expedition. Adiponectin was weakly and negatively associated with BMI at baseline. In contrast, there was a strong positive association between adiponectin and BMI after two weeks of exercise, whereas the association between leptin and BMI became less pronounced. In addition, increasing leptin and decreasing adiponectin levels were associated with increasing PAI-1 activity during the six weeks following the expedition. After six weeks of normal activity, fibrinolytic activity and hormone levels returned towards baseline levels. Heavy exercise induced improved fibrinolytic activity, which was associated independently with changes in circulating levels of the adipocyte-derived hormones leptin and adiponectin. Improved fibrinolytic activity (and reduced risk for cardiovascular disease) related to physical activity could possibly be mediated by leptin and adiponectin.",

    "title": "Adiponectin plasma levels are increased by atorvastatin treatment in subjects at high cardiovascular risk.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin can suppress atherogenesis by inhibiting the adherence of monocytes, reducing their phagocytic activity, and suppressing the accumulation of modified lipoproteins in the vascular wall. Contradictory data have been reported about the effect of statins on adiponectin plasma levels. In this work, adiponectin plasma levels were measured in 102 statin-free subjects from the Spanish population of the Achieve Cholesterol Targets Fast with Atorvastatin Stratified Titration (ACTFAST) study, a 12-week, prospective, multi-centre, open-label trial which enrolled subjects with coronary heart disease, coronary heart disease-equivalent or a 10-year coronary heart disease risk &gt;20%. Subjects were assigned to atorvastatin (10-80 mg/day) based on low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol concentration at screening. For comparison, age and gender-matched blood donors (N=40) were used as controls. Control subjects did not present hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and history of cardiovascular diseases. Adiponectin levels were diminished in patients at high cardiovascular risk compared with control subjects [4166 (3661-4740) vs 5806 (4764-7075) ng/ml respectively; geometric mean (95% CI); P&lt;0.0001]. In the whole population, atorvastatin treatment increased adiponectin levels [9.7 (3.2-16.7);% Change (95% CI); P=0.003]. This increment was in a dose-dependent manner; maximal effect observed with atorvastatin 80 mg/d [24.7 (5.7-47.1); P=0.01]. Adiponectin concentrations were positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol both before and after atorvastatin treatment. No association was observed between adiponectin and LDL-cholesterol before and after atorvastatin treatment. In conclusion, atorvastatin increased adiponectin plasma levels in subjects at high cardiovascular risk, revealing a novel anti-inflammatory effect of this drug.",

    "title": "Including indigestible carbohydrates in the evening meal of healthy subjects improves glucose tolerance, lowers inflammatory markers, and increases satiety after a subsequent standardized breakfast.",
    "abstract": "Low-glycemic index (GI) foods and foods rich in whole grain are associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We studied the effect of cereal-based bread evening meals (50 g available starch), varying in GI and content of indigestible carbohydrates, on glucose tolerance and related variables after a subsequent standardized breakfast in healthy subjects (n = 15). At breakfast, blood was sampled for 3 h for analysis of blood glucose, serum insulin, serum FFA, serum triacylglycerides, plasma glucagon, plasma gastric-inhibitory peptide, plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), serum interleukin (IL)-6, serum IL-8, and plasma adiponectin. Satiety was subjectively rated after breakfast and the gastric emptying rate (GER) was determined using paracetamol as a marker. Breath hydrogen was measured as an indicator of colonic fermentation. Evening meals with barley kernel based bread (ordinary, high-amylose- or beta-glucan-rich genotypes) or an evening meal with white wheat flour bread (WWB) enriched with a mixture of barley fiber and resistant starch improved glucose tolerance at the subsequent breakfast compared with unsupplemented WWB (P &lt; 0.05). At breakfast, the glucose response was inversely correlated with colonic fermentation (r = -0.25; P &lt; 0.05) and GLP-1 (r = -0.26; P &lt; 0.05) and positively correlated with FFA (r = 0.37; P &lt; 0.001). IL-6 was lower (P &lt; 0.01) and adiponectin was higher (P &lt; 0.05) at breakfast following an evening meal with barley-kernel bread compared with WWB. Breath hydrogen correlated positively with satiety (r = 0.27; P &lt; 0.01) and inversely with GER (r = -0.23; P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, the composition of indigestible carbohydrates of the evening meal may affect glycemic excursions and related metabolic risk variables at breakfast through a mechanism involving colonic fermentation. The results provide evidence for a link between gut microbial metabolism and key factors associated with insulin resistance.",

    "title": "Plasma adiponectin levels and clinical outcomes among haemodialysis patients.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin (ADPN) levels are consistently elevated among patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, but its relationship with cardiovascular outcomes in this population remains controversial. We measured baseline and yearly plasma ADPN in 182 prevalent haemodialysis patients recruited to the Haemodialysis (HEMO) Study from two Boston centres. Plasma ADPN at baseline and during follow-up was studied in relation to prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Baseline plasma ADPN levels were found to be approximately twofold higher than in the general population and correlated inversely with (log-transformed) CRP levels and (log-transformed) body mass index (BMI). Levels measured over time showed a gradual increase (0.95 microg/mL, 95% CI = 0.12-1.78 microg/mL; P = 0.03) by year, although this difference became non-significant after adjustment for covariates. Baseline ADPN levels were lower among patients with pre-existing CVD (adjusted OR of 0.67; P = 0.03). They also predicted all-cause mortality (P &lt; 0.01) and the composite outcome of 'cardiovascular events/cardiovascular mortality' (P &lt; 0.01); levels measured over time predicted the composite outcome of 'cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality' (P &lt; 0.01). These relationships were non-linear (quadratic) with the hazard for each outcome increasing in the lower and upper ranges of the distribution of ADPN, and strengthened after adjustment for baseline covariates including serum albumin, CVD and the flux and dialysis dose categorization of the HEMO study. In summary, low plasma levels of ADPN were associated with inflammation and pre-existing CVD; ADPN levels predicted cardiovascular and mortality outcomes, the relationship being extensively confounded by multiple patient-related factors.",

    "abstract": "The effects of a very-low-carbohydrate, high-saturated-fat weight-loss diet (LC) on brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and markers of endothelial function are unknown. The effect of an LC on markers of endothelial function and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk was compared with that of an isocaloric high-carbohydrate, low-saturated-fat diet (HC). FMD and markers of endothelial function (n = 70) and CVD risk were measured before and after 8 wk of weight loss. Ninety-nine subjects aged 50.0 +/- 8.3 y with a body mass index (in kg/m2) of 33.7 +/- 4.1 completed the study. Mean (+/-SD) FMD did not change significantly (P = 0.55) with either diet. Pulse wave velocity improved with both diets (P &lt; 0.01). Endothelial markers, E- and P selectin, intracellular and cellular-adhesion molecule-1, tissue-type plasminogen activator, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 decreased (P &lt; 0.001), with no diet effect. Adiponectin did not change significantly. More weight (P = 0.05 for diet x time interaction) and more abdominal fat mass (P = 0.05 for diet x time interaction) were lost with the LC than with the HC. LDL cholesterol decreased more with the HC than with the LC (P &lt; 0.05, time x diet), and C-reactive protein decreased more with the HC than with the LC (P &lt; 0.05 for diet x time interaction). Homocysteine increased more with the LC (P &lt; 0.01 for diet x time interaction). Folate decreased with the LC and increased with the HC (P &lt; 0.05, time; P &lt; 0.001 for diet x time interaction). An LC does not impair FMD. We observed beneficial effects of both diets on most of the CVD risk factors measured. This trial was registered with the Australian Clinical Trials Registry as ACTR N0 12606000203550.",

    "abstract": "Type II diabetes mellitus is currently globally one of the fastest growing non-communicable diseases, especially in developing countries. This investigation reports on a meta-analysis undertaken of the C-11377G locus within the adiponectin gene in a black South African, a Cuban Hispanic and a German Caucasian cohort. Genotyping was performed via a real-time PCR strategy. Both fixed- and random-effects models were tested to describe the diabetes risk at both the cohort and population levels. The 2,2 genotype may only be associated with increased diabetes risk in the Cuban Hispanic cohort. Population-specific effects may have masked these associations upon meta-analytical analysis, as no significant odds ratio could be determined. Thus, to examine diabetes risk, a more global approach including the design of population-specific experimental strategies should be used, which will be crucial in developing health education and policies in a global health programme.",

    "abstract": "Impaired exercise capacity, adiponectin, MMPs and TIMPs have all been implicated in the development of cardiovascular disease. The aim of our study was to determine the effects of rosiglitazone on these factors in diabetic patients. Seventy individuals with Type 2 diabetes were assigned randomly to either a rosiglitazone group (8 mg/day, RG) or a control group (CG) for 6 months. All participants took gliclazide 160 mg plus metformin 1700 mg in stable dose. None of the individuals had diabetic complications or had previously participated in an exercise programme. Anthropometric parameters, VO2 peak, oxygen pulse, glycaemic indices, lipid profile, adiponectin, insulin resistance, blood pressure and serum MMP-9, TIMP-1, TIMP-2 levels were assessed at baseline and at the end of the study. After Bonferroni adjustment, a P-value &lt; 0.017 was assumed to be statistically significant. Rosiglitazone treatment significantly increased VO2 peak (P &lt; 0.0001), the duration of the exercise test (P &lt; 0.0001), oxygen pulse (P = 0.010) and TIMP-2 levels (P = 0.008) in comparison with CG. Insulin resistance, hyperglycaemia, diastolic blood pressure and MMP-9 levels were also reduced (P &lt; 0.017). Fat mass, lipid profile, TIMP-1 levels and MMP9 : TIMP-1 ratio were unaltered after rosiglitazone treatment. There were no significant changes in these parameters in control subjects. In univariate analysis, the rosiglitazone-induced increment of VO2 peak was associated with alterations in plasma adiponectin (r = 0.691), HOMA-IR (r = -0.782) and HbA(1c) (r = -0.676) (P &lt; 0.017). These relationships retained significance after multiple regression analysis (P = 0.005). Rosiglitazone treatment increases cardiorespiratory fitness and modulates favourably serum adiponectin, MMP-9 and TIMP-2 levels. Whether these effects produce cardiovascular benefits in the long term requires further investigation.",

    "title": "Effects of low- and high-flux dialyzers on oxidative stress and insulin resistance.",
    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The cornerstone of high CVD incidence in ESRD patients is endothelial dysfunction which results from inflammation, oxidative stress and insulin resistance. Although various modalities of hemodialysis (HD) have been presumed to exert different effects on oxidative stress and insulin resistance, solid evidence is still lacking. 40 ESRD patients undergoing HD were prospectively enrolled and divided randomly into two groups. Patients in each group received either F8 HPS (low-flux) (Group A) or FX80 (high-flux) (Group B) as HD dialyzers for 2 consecutive months. Diet pattern and medications were kept as usual in both groups to avoid considerable blood glucose change during study period. Blood samples were taken at the start and end of the study. A total of 38 patients (18 and 20 for Groups A and B, respectively) completed the study. Within each group, there was no change in adiponectin, plasma 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2)(alpha), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, blood glucose and insulin after 2 months of treatment except a significant change of HOMA(IR) (p = 0.02) in high-flux group. The significant change of HOMA(IR) between the two groups (p = 0.017) mainly results from the parallel change of insulin between the two groups (p = 0.03). For patients receiving HD, the high-flux dialyzer with synthetic polysulfone membranes fails to provide a better anti-inflammatory or antioxidative effect than the low-flux dialyzer; however, the high-flux dialyzer does significantly improve insulin resistance in this short-term study. This result implies that the high-flux dialyzer might provide better cardiovascular protection than the low-flux dialyzer. Therefore, the low-flux dialyzer might be considered for patients who only need short-term HD therapy. Regarding patients under long-term maintenance HD therapy, a high-flux dialyzer might be the choice of dialyzer.",

The aim of this systematic review is to assess the body of evidence critically for the effects of exercise on adiponectin levels. Literature searches using the Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane Controlled Trials registry, EMBASE, and SportDiscus databases were conducted from 1966 to September 2006 using keywords pertaining to adiponectin and exercise. Thirty-three trials met the inclusion criteria. Study designs consisted of 5 cross-sectional studies, 7 trials of acute exercise, 11 uncontrolled trials, 2 non-randomized controlled trials, and 8 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Exercise of varying prescription has been shown to increase serum adiponectin in 38% of RCTs, demonstrating small-to-moderate effect sizes (ESs). One study reported a dose-response effect of resistance training intensity and the augmentation of adiponectin. Inconsistent support in the literature exists for increasing adiponectin levels after short-term exposure to robust aerobic or resistance training of moderate-to-high intensities. Particular attention should be directed toward high-risk cohorts, in whom augmentation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine adiponectin may assume critical importance.",

Any factor, including diet, that may positively influence adiponectin gene expression or increase circulating levels might be useful for improving such metabolic abnormalities. We investigated the effects of alterations in dietary fatty acid saturation on fasting serum adiponectin and associated peptides. Double-blind, randomized, crossover, 2 x 3-week residential intervention trial where 18 mildly hyperlipidemic adult men were provided with a high saturated:unsaturated fat (SFA:USFA) and lower SFA:USFA treatment separated by an uncontrolled 4-week washout. Only fatty acid profile was altered between treatments. Fasting blood samples were collected on days 0, 1, 7, 14, 21, 22 of each intervention period for the measurement of adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsC-RP), leptin, and ghrelin. Body weight was kept constant (+/-1 kg) throughout each treatment. There was no detectable difference in fasting adiponectin at baseline (mean day 0 + day 1) between the treatment groups (mean +/- s.d.; high(SFA:USFA) = 7.0 +/- 1.7 vs. low(SFA:USFA) = 6.7 +/- 1.4 microg/ml, P &gt; 0.05).

Fasting serum adiponectin was not detectably affected by alterations in dietary fatty acid profile in mildly hyperlipidemic men.

The effect of this combination therapy on other indicators of coronary heart disease risk, however, has yet to be determined.

In an 8 week, parallel-arm trial, 84 subjects were randomized to 1 of 4 groups: combination, exercise, plant sterols, or control.

High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased by 7.5% and 9.5% (p &lt; 0.01) in the combination and exercise groups, respectively. Plant sterols increased (p &lt; 0.05) adiponectin levels by 16%. No change in apoA1, apoB, ghrelin, or growth hormone levels were noted in any intervention group. ApoA1 was correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = 0.33, p = 0.01), whereas apoB was weakly related to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (r = 0.13, p = 0.002). Adiponectin was associated with body mass index (r = -0.10, p = 0.006) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = 0.17, p = 0.0003).

We examined the separate and combined effects of a 1-y exercise and diet intervention on several adipokines; adiponectin, interleukin-6 and -8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, hepatocyte growth factor, nerve growth factor, C-reactive protein, and resistin. One hundred eighty-eight men with several risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular disease were randomly allocated to 4 groups: diet, exercise, combined diet and exercise, and control. Plasma adiponectin concentrations remained unchanged, whereas body mass index and fat mass decreased after dietary changes and an increase in physical activity. In the control group, adiponectin concentrations were reduced. Analyzed according to the factorial design, only diet intervention had a significant (P = 0.03) positive effect on plasma adiponectin relative to control, and this effect was largely explained by changes in fat mass. After adjustment for change in percentage body fat, there were significant positive effects on tumor necrosis factor-alpha in all 3 intervention groups (P = 0.01 for the diet group, 0.03 for the exercise group, and 0.05 for the combined diet and exercise group). Minor changes were observed for the other adipokines. Neither baseline concentrations of nor changes in adiponectin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were significantly correlated to the other adipokines, whereas concentrations of and changes in the other adipokines were significantly correlated.

    "title": "Association of adipose most abundant transcript 1 gene (apM1) with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a Chinese population: a meta-analysis of case-control studies.",
    "abstract": "Polymorphisms of the adipose most abundant transcript 1 gene (apM1) may be closely associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as described in several recent publications. In the present study, a meta-analysis was performed to quantitatively analyse the association of apM1 polymorphisms with T2DM using previous case-control studies in Chinese populations. Several electronic databases were searched for relevant articles up to January 2007. After data collection and gene loci selection, a meta-analysis was performed to assess heterogeneity, combine results and evaluate variations. Publication bias was examined by the Egger's linear regression test and fail-safe number for P = 0.05 (Nfs(0.05)). Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) test and different effect models were employed for the sensitivity analysis. The meta-analysis for this study included 2379 subjects from nine studies. The distribution of SNP45TG + GG and SNP276GG polymorphisms of the apM1 was analysed. Results of these experiments revealed a significant association between the SNP45TG + GG and SNP276GG polymorphisms of apM1 with T2DM in Chinese populations (P &lt; or = 0.05). There was some heterogeneity in the SNP45TG + GG apM1 among these studies. The odds ratio (OR) of apM1 genotype SNP45TG + GG in T2DM was 1.59 when compared with controls (95% CI, 1.00-2.53, P = 0.05), and the OR for the wild-apM1 genotype SNP276GG in T2DM was 1.26 (95% CI, 1.00-1.59, P = 0.05). The publication bias diagnostics and sensitivity analysis confirmed the reliability and stability of this meta-analysis. This apM1 polymorphism was found to be strongly associated with T2DM, and the SNP45TG + GG and SNP276GG forms of the apM1 increased risk for T2DM in Chinese populations.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of pioglitazone (PIO) and simvastatin (SIMVA) on adiponectin and visfatin concentrations in nondiabetic patients with metabolic syndrome and increased risk for cardiovascular complications in a prospective randomized clinical trial. One-hundred twenty-five nondiabetic patients with increased cardiovascular risk [78 females, 47 males, age (mean+/-STD:58.6+/-7.8years, BMI:30.8+/-4.2(kg/m2] were included after randomization to PIO+lacebo, SIMVA+placebo, or PIO+SIMVA treatment for 3 months. At baseline and endpoint, measurements of HbA1c, glucose, insulin, LDL cholesterol, adiponectin and visfatin were performed. Insulin resistance was assessed by means of the HOMAIR-score. Improvement in the HOMAIR-score was observed with PIO and the combination, but not with SIMVA alone, which was accompanied by an increase in adiponectin with PIO treatment groups, but a decrease with SIMVA alone (baseline/endpoint: PIO: 14.0+/-8.2 mg/l/ 27.6+/- 14.5 mg/l, p&lt;0.05; PIO+SIMVA: 11.7+/-10.0 mg/l/26.7+/-15.7 mg/l, p&lt;0.05; SIMVA: 15.5+/-12.7 mg/l/ 11.6+/-7.0 mg/l, p&lt;0.05). No change could be observed in the visfatin concentrations (PIO: 47.6+/-14.5 ng/ml/48.0+/-11.6 ng/ml, PIO+SIMVA: 45.1+/-10.9 ng/ml/47.9+/-10.1 ng/ml, SIMVA: 49.2+/- 13.4 ng/ml/52.1+/-16.7 ng/ml, n. s. in all cases). Insulin resistance and/or cardiovascular risk indicators were not associated with visfatin levels. Regulation of visfatin secretion occurs through biochemical pathways independent from those influenced by pioglitazone or simvastatin.",

Statins reduce cardiovascular events in patients with the MS and have pleiotropic effects in addition to lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Because there is a paucity of data on the effect of statins on adiponectin levels and insulin sensitivity in the MS, this study was conducted to test the effect of simvastatin (40 mg/day) compared with placebo on circulating adiponectin levels and homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance in subjects with the MS in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Simvastatin therapy failed to affect circulating adiponectin levels or insulin sensitivity compared with placebo over 8 weeks. In conclusion, although simvastatin is anti-inflammatory, it failed to affect adiponectin levels or improve insulin sensitivity in subjects with the MS.",

    "abstract": "LDL apheresis is an extracorporal modality to lower the concentration of atherogenic lipoproteins, e.g., LDL cholesterol. We compared two recently introduced whole-blood LDL apheresis systems inpatients with hypercholesterolemia in a randomized cross-over trial with respect to their effects on lipoproteins as well as on other cardiovascular risk markers. Six patients (4 women, 2 men, median age 62.5 years, median BMI 25.9 kg/m(2)) on regular LDL apheresis were randomly assigned to receive six weekly treatments with either DALI (Fresenius) or Liposorber D (Kaneka). After 6 weeks, the patients were switched to the other device (again six weekly treatments). Blood was drawn before and immediately after LDL apheresis at three time points (last regular apheresis before the study; after six treatments with DALI and after six treatments with Liposorber D). LDL cholesterol concentration before the sixth apheresis (DALI 129 mg/dL, Liposorber D 132 mg/dL) as well as LDL cholesterol reduction during the sixth apheresis (DALI 68.3% and Liposorber D 68.4%) were similar with the two systems. CRP and fibrinogen concentrations were lower but interleukin-6, myeloperoxidase, and resistin concentrations were higher after the last Liposorber treatment compared with DALI (P &lt; 0.05, respectively). No differences were observed concerning adiponectin, ghrelin, and PYY levels. In conclusion, both devices were highly effective in eliminating atherogenic lipoproteins. CRP and fibrinogen were better eliminated with Liposorber D. However, following Liposorber D, interleukin-6 levels were higher than after DALI possibly indicating an increased inflammatory activation.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of PPAR-gamma agonist rosiglitazone, relative to sulfonylureas, on circulating levels of adiponectin and the prothrombotic factor, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1, in type 2 diabetic patients, and to investigate, in animal models, whether the antithrombotic action of rosiglitazone was mediated through adiponectin. Our clinical study (n=64) showed that after 24-week add-on therapy, the rosiglitazone group had a greater mean reduction in plasma PAI-1 levels (25%, versus 12% in sulfonylurea group, P=0.002). Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis identified the reduction in plasma fasting glucose and the rise in adiponectin levels to be independently associated with the reduction in PAI-I concentration in the rosiglitazone-treated patients. Rosiglitazone (20 mg/kg/d) reduced adipose tissue PAI-1 mRNA expression and its plasma levels in wild-type C57 mice with diet-induced obesity (P&lt;0.001), but this suppressive effect was attenuated in adiponectin knockout mice. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of adiponectin led to a significant suppression of adipose tissue PAI-1 expression and its circulating concentrations in db/db diabetic mice. Our in vitro study demonstrated that recombinant adiponectin directly inhibited PAI-1 production in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The antithrombotic effect of rosiglitazone is mediated, at least in part, through the suppressive effect of adiponectin on PAI-1 production.",

We determined the effect of rosiglitazone in 15 type 2 diabetic patients and compared these results to 14 randomly assigned placebo patients. After 3 months, the urinary albumin to creatinine ratio was significantly decreased, while the glucose metabolic clearance rate, during insulin clamp, was significantly increased by rosiglitazone compared to the placebo group. Fasting free fatty acid and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels were significantly decreased, while the adiponectin concentration was significantly increased by rosiglitazone treatment. The percentage decrease in albuminuria correlated with the decrease in fasting plasma glucose, free fatty acids TNF-alpha and the increase in fat mass, plasma adiponectin, and glucose metabolic clearance rate. Stepwise linear regression analysis showed the decrease in TNF-alpha and the increase in adiponectin were independently associated with decreased albuminuria. Our study indicates that thiazolidinediones may be useful to prevent nephropathy in type 2 diabetic patients.",

    "abstract": "To observe the effect of fish oil supplementation on arterial elasticity and blood pressure (BP) in overweight hypertensive patients. This was a double-blind, randomized and placebo-controlled clinical study, in which 52 overweight hypertensive patients from a community were selected and randomly allocated to two groups (26 in the fish oil group (3 g day(-1), fish oil capsules) and 26 in the placebo group (only capsules). All the subjects were follow-up for 8 weeks. The arterial elasticity was determined by CVProfilor DO-2020 and expressed as elasticity indexes (C(1)-large artery and C(2)-small artery). During the follow-up, totally nine cases were dropped out (three cases from the fish oil group and six cases from the placebo group). After 8 weeks follow-up, the large artery elasticity in the fish oil group, compared with its baseline, was significantly improved (C(1): 15.5+/-1.5 vs 12.8+/-3.7 ml mm Hg(-1) x 10), whereas no effects were found in the placebo group (C(1): 13.0+/-3.4 vs 13.4+/-3.8 ml mm Hg(-1) x 10), P=0.027, RM-ANOVA across the two groups. The small artery elasticity (C(2)), BP and pulse pressure were not found any changes, either in the fish oil group or in the placebo group. At same time, the serum soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1(sVCAM-1) and leptin levels, the lipid profile and insulin sensitivity index (ISI) as well, did not show significant differences between two groups. Fish oil supplementation certainly would improve large arterial elasticity but no effect on BP in overweight hypertensive patients. Further study is needed to confirm the benefits of fish oil supplementation on age-related increases in arterial stiffness.",

    "title": "Adiponectin levels are reduced, independent of polymorphisms in the adiponectin gene, after supplementation with alpha-linolenic acid among healthy adults.",
    "abstract": "Our first aim was to determine whether an isocaloric intervention using alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) in the form of flaxseed oil would alter adiponectin levels among overweight, otherwise healthy, males and females, and our second aim was to test for any potential modification of this intervention by 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (276 and 45) in the adiponectin gene. Subjects included healthy adult males and females (approximately 81% female; average age, 38 years) with increased waist circumference (mean, 99 cm) and body mass index (mean, 30 kg/m(2)) who were free of chronic disease, not taking medications, and sedentary. Subjects met weekly with a registered dietician for 8 weeks. The control subjects (n = 27) were instructed not to alter their habitual diet and the ALA group (n = 30) was instructed to follow an enriched ALA diet by using flaxseed oil capsules (increasing ALA to 5% of total energy intake) and to lower their dietary fat consumption by a commensurate amount. Diets were analyzed using the Food Intake and Analysis System (v. 3.0, University of Texas School of Public Health, 1998). Fasting blood samples were obtained before and after the 8-week intervention. We found significant decreases (P = .02) in adiponectin (10.12 microg/mL pre, 9.23 microg/mL post) in the ALA group as compared with the control group (7.93 microg/mL pre, 8.10 microg/mL post) after the intervention. We also saw a decline in adiponectin in all genotype groups with the greatest decline among those carrying the rare T allele of single nucleotide polymorphism 276. There were no significant changes in fasting insulin, glucose, or quantitative insulin sensitivity check index values as a result of this intervention. In conclusion, this study suggests that supplementing with ALA for 8 weeks may lower adiponectin levels among healthy individuals, and this effect appears to be independent of polymorphisms in the adiponectin gene. Although the change in adiponectin in response to the omega-3 fatty acids was not accompanied by any change in glucose, insulin, or quantitative insulin sensitivity check index, long-term implications of such a decrease should be considered in future studies.",

We aimed to study effects of selective and non-selective beta-blockers on body weight, insulin resistance, plasma concentrations of leptin and resistin in patients with CHF. Twenty-six non-cachectic beta-blocker-naive patients with CHF were randomized and treated with either carvedilol or bisoprolol. Body weight, plasma concentrations of leptin, resistin, fasting glucose and insulin were measured at baseline and after 6 months of therapy. Insulin resistance was estimated by homeostasis model assessment- estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Body weight increased significantly in the carvedilol group (mean change + 2.30 kg, p = 0.023) while it did not change in the bisoprolol group (mean change -0.30 kg, p = 0.623) (ns between groups). Plasma leptin concentration increased only in the carvedilol group (mean change + 4.20 ng/ml, p = 0.019) (ns between groups). Fasting glucose and resistin remained unchanged in both groups. After 6 months, mean plasma insulin concentration changed significantly differently (p = 0.015) in the bisoprolol (mean change +3.1 microU/ml) compared to the carvedilol group (mean change -6.3 microU/ml) and HOMA-IR was consequently higher in the bisoprolol compared to the carvedilol group (5.2 +/- 4.2 vs 2.8 +/- 1.6, p = 0.046). This study found different metabolic effects of carvedilol and bisoprolol in non-cachectic patients with CHF. With unchanged fasting plasma glucose concentration after 6 months of treatment, carvedilol significantly decreased plasma insulin concentration and insulin resistance compared to bisoprolol.",

Bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) improve vascular function and predict cardiovascular risk. The effect of pioglitazone therapy on EPCs was examined. We performed a prospective, randomized, double-blind study on patients with documented stable coronary artery disease and normal glucose tolerance. Of 54 patients with normal fasting glucose levels, 18 showed impaired glucose tolerance and 36 patients with normal glucose tolerance were randomized to 30-day treatment with pioglitazone (45 mg) or placebo in addition to optimal medical therapy. All patients in the TZD group showed an increase of adiponectin levels as an indicator of compliance (11.4 +/- 1.1 to 36.8 +/- 2.1 microg/ml; P &lt; 0.001). TZD, but not placebo, decreased mean high-sensitivity C-reactive protein to 43 +/- 19% (P &lt; 0.05).

EPC numbers were not changed in the placebo group. TZD increased the SDF-1-induced migratory capacity to 146 +/- 9% per EPC number (P &lt; 0.05) and upregulated the clonogenic potential of EPCs, increasing the colony-forming units to 172 +/- 12% (P &lt; 0.001). In cultured human EPCs, TZD increased EPC numbers and migration and reduced NADPH-oxidase activity. The TZD effect was reversed by the PPAR gamma antagonist GW9662 and mimicked by treatment with adiponectin. The PPAR gamma agonist pioglitazone increases the number and function of EPCs in patients with coronary artery disease. The effect represents a potential regenerative mechanism in atherosclerosis and is observed in normoglycemic individuals with stable coronary artery disease.",

MDA-LDL level in the 200 mg (calculated as proanthocyanidin) group was significantly (p = 0.008) reduced compared to the basal level, 12 wk after the start of administration. In the 400 mg (calculated as proanthocyanidin) group, a significant decrease in MDA-LDL level compared to the basal level was found 6 and 12 wk after the start of administration (6 wk: p = 0.015, 12 wk: p = 0.009). Subjects with high levels of MDA-LDL/ApoB (MDA-LDL/ApoB &gt; or = 100 mU/mL) in the 200 mg group showed significantly (p = 0.011) reduced MDA-LDL levels at 12 wk after the start of administration.

    "abstract": "Obesity is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and thromboembolic events. We investigated the effects of weight reduction by a 12-week calorie-restricted diet with or without aerobic exercise (diet group and diet plus exercise group) on leptin and anticoagulation proteins levels. Forty-two obese nondiabetic individuals were evaluated for blood levels of leptin, protein C activity, free protein S antigen and for body fat area calculated on computerized tomography before and after intervention. Before intervention, serum levels of leptin and free protein S antigen correlated positively with several adiposity-related parameters. After the program, body weight and fat area were significantly decreased in both groups. Body mass index and leptin levels decreased in both groups, with a larger change in the diet plus exercise group than in the diet group. Although protein C activity levels did not change in both groups, free protein S antigen levels decreased significantly in the diet plus exercise group. In conclusion, the 12-week programs had significant effects on the initial weight reduction and body fat mass, decreasing lepin levels in obese nondiabetic individuals. To clarify whether aerobic exercise has additional or direct effects on the anticoagulation system, a study in a large number of individuals is needed.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin is an adipose tissue-specific protein with antiatherogenic and insulin-sensitizing properties. In patients with essential hypertension, plasma adiponectin concentrations are lower than in healthy subjects. Antihypertensive drugs do not uniformly influence components of the metabolic syndrome. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of 6 months' monotherapy with different antihypertensive drugs on plasma adiponectin concentration in essential hypertension patients. Forty essential hypertension patients were randomized to receive enalapril, metoprolol, amlodipine or indapamide. Plasma concentrations of adiponectin, insulin, glucose and body fat content were estimated twice: before and after 6 months of antihypertensive monotherapy. Plasma adiponectin concentration did not change significantly after enalapril (11.5 +/- 4.8 vs. 11.1 +/- 4.1 mg/l), metoprolol (10.2 +/- 4.2 vs. 9.8 +/- 4.5 mg/l), and amlodipine (9.0 +/- 6.0 vs. 8.5 +/- 5.4 mg/l) treatment. However, a significant decrease of plasma adiponectin concentration (from 11.6 +/- 4.6 to 10.2 +/- 4.2 mg/l, p = 0.047) was observed in patients treated with indapamide. Additionally in these patients, a significant increase of the HOMA-IR index was found (p = 0.021). Treatment with indapamide was followed by a significant decrease of plasma adiponectin concentration. This may participate in the pathogenesis of carbohydrate metabolism disturbances often found in patients treated with thiazide-type diuretics.",

The subjects in each group were equally assigned to receive standard or low dose of E2/NETA (2 mg E2/1 mg NETA, or 1 mg E2/0.5 mg NETA). Accordingly, the 2 groups were divided into 4 subgroups. Serum leptin levels (SLLs), body weight/height, waist/hip girth, BMI and waist-to-hip ratio were evaluated before and after therapy. In the Group IR, WG decreased significantly only in low dose subgroup. In the Group HR, both standard and low dose subgroups had a significant reduction in WG. Those who had WG &gt;or= 88 cm showed more reduction than those who had WG &lt;88 cm in response to both doses of E2/NETA, insignificantly. Basal SLLs had a significant correlation with body weight, BMI and WG.

    "abstract": "Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is associated with cardiovascular risk factors, but the effects of pioglitazone and metformin on IGT are not well described. We tested the hypothesis that each drug would exhibit antiatherogenic and anti-inflammatory effects in subjects with IGT and early diabetes. The study design was a prospective, randomized, open label, cross-over study. Blood tests, including a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), were performed at baseline and after each treatment. Pioglitazone 15 mg/day or metformin 500-750 mg/day was given for 3 months. Biochemical markers to assess insulin resistance as well as lipid, inflammatory, neurohumoral, and hemostatic factors were included. Twenty-five subjects (17 male, 8 female; age [mean+/-SD]: 61+/-9 years; 84% hypertensive) completed the protocol. Of 25 subjects, 14 were diagnosed as IGT and 11 as diabetes with 75-g OGTT. Pioglitazone significantly reduced fasting glucose (p&lt;0.05), and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (p&lt;0.05) and metformin (p&lt;0.01) reduced cholesterol. Both drugs significantly reduced aldosterone (both p&lt;0.05) and von Willebrand factor (vWF) (both p&lt;0.05). Plasma adiponectin was increased only by pioglitazone (p&lt;0.001). Neither drug affected BP levels. In conclusion, pioglitazone was superior to metformin for the improvement of insulin resistance and adiponectin, and both drugs were equally effective in reducing vWF and aldosterone in subjects with IGT and early diabetes. Early intervention with pioglitazone or metformin therapy may reduce the incidence of future cardiovascular disease in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance or early diabetes.",

Leptin levels, body mass index (BMI) and total cholesterol increased significantly within both groups at week 5 compared to inclusion. Leptin levels correlated with BMI in both groups at inclusion and in group 2 at week 9. In group 1, triglyceride levels remained unchanged, while levels in group 2 increased significantly at week 5 compared to inclusion. Clinical and biochemical markers improved during the study compared to inclusion. Increased leptin levels during the study progress were transient, decreasing due to prednisolone withdrawal at the end of the study.

    "abstract": "Horses in training tend to become inappetant; however, the mechanism responsible for this training-induced inappetance is not known. Training and/or ulcers alter the feed intake (FI) and hormonal and/or biochemical (active ghrelin, leptin, glucose, insulin and cortisol) responses to acute high intensity exercise. Eight Standardbred mares underwent 3 interval exercise tests (IET) and 3 parallel control tests (CON) before (IET1) and after 8 weeks of training (IET2) and after treatment for gastric ulcers (IET3). Plasma samples were taken before (0 min), during (last 10 sec of velocities eliciting 40, 100 and 20% VO2max), and after (30 min, 60 min, 24 h) exercise (EX) or CON tests for RIA and colorimetric measurement of the concentrations of the above parameters. Samples were also collected before and after feeding. Horses were trained at a work intensity of 70% HRmax for 30 min/day, 5 days per week with FI measured daily. There were no changes (P&gt;0.05) in any variable during the parallel control trials. However, there was a mismatch between FI and digestible energy (DE) requirements (P&lt;0.05) with EX horses not meeting their DE requirements during the post training IETs. During all IETs, ghrelin, glucose and cortisol increased (P&lt;0.05) during EX. Leptin only increased (P&lt;0.05) during EX in the post training IETs. Insulin remained low during EX, but increased (P&lt;0.05) post EX. High intensity exercise appeared to be associated with decreases in FI and alterations of leptin and ghrelin. More research is needed to determine if there is a relationship between alterations of these hormones and changes in FI in horses that lose weight while in training.",

    "title": "Combination therapy of statin with flavonoids rich extract from chokeberry fruits enhanced reduction in cardiovascular risk markers in patients after myocardial infraction (MI).",
    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown, that chronic flavonoids treatment improves vascular function and cardiovascular remodeling by decreasing superoxide anion production as well as by increasing NO realize from endothelial cells. A progressive decrease in systolic blood pressure and reduction of low-density lipoprotein oxidation (Ox-LDL) has also been reported. However, none of these studies were done in patient with coronary artery disease treated with statins. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel trial. Forty-four patients (11 women and 33 men, mean age 66 years) who survived myocardial infraction and have received statin therapy for at least 6 months (80% dose of 40 mg/day simvastatin) were included in the study. The subjects were randomised to receive either 3 x 85 mg/day of chokeberry flavonoid extract (Aronia melanocarpa E) or placebo for a period of 6 weeks. The study extract was a commercially-available (OTC) product of the following declared composition: anthocyans (about 25%), polymeric procyanidines (about 50%) and phenolic acids (about 9%). Compared to placebo (ANOVA and Tukey's test), flavonoids significantly reduced serum 8-isoprostans (p&lt;0.000) and Ox-LDL levels (p&lt;0.000) (by 38 and 29%, respectively), as well as hsCRP (p&lt;0.007) and MCP-1 (p&lt;0.001) levels (by 23 and 29%, respectively). In addition, significant increase in adiponectin (p&lt;0.03) levels and reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure by a mean average of 11 and 7.2 mmHg, respectively were found. In view of the fact that chokeberry flavonoids reduce the severity of inflammation, regardless of statins, they can be used clinically for secondary prevention of ischaemic heart disease.",

Exclusion criteria were serious illness, smoking, or taking antioxidant supplements. Participants were randomized to receive 800 IU/d natural vitamin E (n = 39) or placebo (n = 41) for 3 months with an increase in the dose to 1200 IU/d for a further 3 months. Plasma 8-isoprostane and adiponectin concentrations were measured at baseline and 3 and 6 months. During 6 months of supplementation with vitamin E, plasma vitamin E concentration increased significantly (p &lt; 0.001) by 76%, and plasma 8-isoprostane concentrations decreased significantly (-11%, p = 0.03), whereas plasma adiponectin concentrations did not change significantly. These findings suggest that supplementation with high-dose vitamin E decreases systemic oxidative stress and 8-isoprostane concentrations in overweight/obese individuals. A decrease in plasma 8-isoprostane has the potential to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease in obesity.",

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of simvastatin therapy on insulin resistance and on leptin, adiponectin, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, as compared to metformin, in overweight pre-diabetic subjects. Forty-one subjects with BMI &gt;25 kg/m(2) and impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance were randomized to take simvastatin, 20 mg/day (N = 20) or metformin, 1.7 g/day (N = 21) for 16 weeks. Blood samples for the determination of metabolic, hormonal, and inflammatory parameters were obtained at baseline and after each treatment. After metformin therapy, significant reductions in mean BMI and waist circumference were observed, and after simvastatin treatment LDL and triglyceride levels were significantly reduced. Insulin resistance determined by the homeostasis model assessment decreased only with metformin. Independently of the type of medication, a significant decrease in CRP levels was detected from baseline to the end of the study. CRP showed a mean reduction of 0.12 +/- 0.04 mg/dL (P = 0.002) over time. No change in leptin or adiponectin levels was induced by any therapy. The data suggest that a low dose of simvastatin does not affect insulin resistance in overweight pre-diabetic subjects and has no effect on leptin or adiponectin levels. Further studies including a larger sample size, higher doses of statins, and a placebo control group are necessary to confirm the present data.",

    "abstract": "Adipocytokines are under investigation as mediators of cardiovascular risk. In 142 non-diabetic postmenopausal women, we investigated whether plasma levels of adiponectin and leptin are associated with changes in carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and distensibility as assessed by high-resolution ultrasound. Adiponectin but not leptin correlated weakly with baseline measures of IMT and distensibility. After 12 months, carotid IMT showed a significant progression [0.023 mm (95% CI, 0.014-0.031 mm)] whereas stiffness was unaltered. A threshold was identified for the relation of adiponectin with both progression of IMT and stiffness. Age-adjusted adiponectin levels in the lowest quartile versus second to fourth quartile were related to progression of IMT (odds ratio, 2.99; 95% CI, 1.81-5.09) and stiffness (odds ratio, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.19-4.07). Adjustment for possible confounding factors and intermediates weakened this association only to a minor degree. No such associations were observed for leptin. We conclude that low levels of adiponectin are associated with adverse changes in morphology and function of central arteries over time independently of other cardiovascular risk factors in postmenopausal non-diabetic women.",

Effect of fibrates on adiponectin has not been clarified, whereas thiazolidinediones enhance adiponectin. Thus, we explored the possibility and mechanism that fibrates enhance adiponectin in humans, mice, and cells. Significant increase of serum adiponectin was observed in bezafibrate-treated subjects compared with placebo group in patients enrolled in The Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention study. Higher baseline adiponectin levels were strongly associated with reduced risk of new diabetes. Fibrates, bezafibrate and fenofibrate, significantly elevated adiponectin levels in wild-type mice and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Such an effect was not observed in PPARalpha-deficient mice and adipocytes. Fibrates activated adiponectin promoter but failed to enhance its activity when the point mutation occurred in peroxisome proliferators response element site and the endogenous PPARalpha was knocked down by PPARalpha-RNAi. Our results suggest that fibrates enhance adiponectin partly through adipose PPARalpha and measurement of adiponectin might be a useful tool for searching subjects at high risk for diabetes.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether antioxidant (AOX) supplementation attenuates post-exercise oxidative stress and contributors to oxidative stress (inflammation, blood lipids) in overweight young adults. This was a randomized, double-blind, controlled study. Overweight (BMI, 33.2 +/- 1.9 kg/m(2)) and comparative normal-weight (BMI, 21.9 +/- 0.5 kg/m(2)) adults 18 to 30 years old (total N = 48) were enrolled. Participants received either daily antioxidant (AOX) treatment (800 IU of vitamin E, 500 mg of vitamin C, 10 mg of beta-carotene) or placebo (PL) for 8 weeks for a total of four groups. All participants completed a standardized 30-minute cycle exercise bout at baseline and 8 weeks. Exercise-induced changes in lipid hydroperoxide (DeltaPEROX), C-reactive protein (DeltaCRP), interleukin-6 (DeltaIL-6), cholesterol subfractions, triglycerides, total AOX status (DeltaTAS), and adiponectin were assessed. Exercise-induced DeltaPEROX was lower in the overweight-AOX group (0.09 nM/kg per min) compared with PL-treated overweight and normal-weight groups (0.98, 0.53 nM/kg per min) by 8 weeks (p &lt; 0.05). Adiponectin was increased in both overweight and normal-weight AOX groups (22.1% vs. 3.1%; p &lt; 0.05) but reduced in PL groups. DeltaIL-6, Deltatotal cholesterol, and Deltalow-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations during exercise were lower in the AOX-treated groups compared with PL groups (all p &lt; 0.05). After controlling for BMI, the Deltatotal cholesterol, Deltalow-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, Deltaadiponectin, and DeltaTAS explained 59.1% of the variance of the regression model of the DeltaPEROX by 8 weeks (total model R(2) = 0.600; p = 0.015). AOX lowers exercise-induced oxidative stress in overweight adults. Inflammatory and lipid markers may also be attenuated with AOX. Further studies are needed to determine whether AOX may be used in cardiovascular disease prevention in the overweight population.",

    "abstract": "To compare the effects of intratracheal general anesthesia (ITGA) and regional (saddle block) anesthesia on leptin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and cortisol blood concentrations during anorectal surgery. Fifty-eight patients suffering from hemorrhoidal disease, pilonidal sinus, anal fissure, or anal fistula were included the study. Patients were randomly assigned into one of the two groups (n=29). Patients in one group received ITGA. After thiopental and fentanyl induction, vecuronium was used as a muscle relaxant. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane. In the other group we applied saddle block, injecting hyperbaric bupivacaine into the subarachnoid space, through the L3-L4 intervertebral space, in the sitting position. Blood samples were collected for leptin, CRP, and cortisol analysis before the induction of anesthesia at 3 and 24 hours postoperatively. Preoperative leptin, CRP, and cortisol concentrations were comparable between the groups. There was no significant difference in postoperative levels of leptin and CRP in both groups. Although not significant, leptin and CRP concentrations were lower in the saddle block group at three hours postoperatively (mean-/+SD, 6.95-/+8.59 and 6.02-/+12.25, respectively) than in the ITGA group (mean-/+SD, 9.04-/+9.89 and 8.40-/+15.75, respectively). During early postoperative period, cortisol increased slightly in the ITGA group and remained at similar level in the saddle block group, but later decreased in both groups. Cortisol levels in the saddle block group were significantly lower than in the ITGA group at 3 hours postoperatively (343.7-/+329.6 vs 611.4-/+569.8; P=0.034). Saddle block, a regional anesthetic technique, may attenuate stress response in patients undergoing anorectal surgery, by blocking afferent neural input during early postoperative period.",

    "abstract": "Reduced incidence of type-2 diabetes has been shown in patients treated with pravastatin. Adiponectin can exhibit beneficial effects on glucose metabolism. We investigated whether pravastatin could improve glucose tolerance associated with increasing adiponectin levels in patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). This study consisted of 40 coronary artery disease (CAD) patients with IGT assessed by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Patients were randomized to receive pravastatin (n=20) or no lipid-lowering medications (control group, n=20) for 6 months, after which OGTT was repeated and adiponectin levels were measured. Pravastatin treatment significantly decreased levels of total cholesterol (16%), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (23%) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (37%) (p&lt;0.01, respectively). At 2h in OGTT, pravastatin significantly improved hyperglycemia (-14%) and hyperinsulinemia (-23%). Pravastatin treatment significantly elevated plasma adiponectin levels (35%; p&lt;0.001) but not in the control group. The glucose reduction at 2h post-OGTT was significantly associated with increased levels of adiponectin (r=-0.462; p=0.003). Pravastatin treatment is an independent predictor for improvement of post-loaded hyperglycemia (odds ratio; 5.7; 95% confidence interval 1.7-19.3; p=0.003) and achieved beneficial conversion from IGT to normal glucose tolerance (40%; p=0.03). Pravastatin exhibits beneficial effects on glucose metabolism especially in the postprandial state associated with increasing plasma adiponectin levels in CAD patients with IGT.",

    "abstract": "Psychosocial factors, such as stress and vital exhaustion, are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, and women report more psychosocial ill-being after an acute myocardial infarction than men. We have earlier shown that a cognitive-behavioural intervention in women with ischaemic heart disease (IHD) improved psychosocial well-being. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the improvement in psychosocial well-being is associated with an improvement in biochemical indicators of cardiovascular risk. Randomized-controlled trial in northern Sweden. Outpatient care. Women with IHD were randomized to either a 1-year cognitive-behavioural stress management programme or usual care. Of the 159 women who completed the study, 77 were in the intervention group, and 82 in the control group. A 1-year cognitive-behavioural stress management programme versus conventional care. Group assignment was not found to be a determinant of waist circumference, high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor (vWF), plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) activity, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) activity, tPA antigen, tPA-PAI-1 complex, leptin, or HOMA2 insulin resistance index (HOMA2-IR) at follow up. Changes in psychosocial variables were not associated with changes in any of the biological risk indicators. Even if our cognitive-behavioural stress management programme had effects on proximal targets, such as stress behaviour and vital exhaustion, we found no improvement in intermediate biochemical targets related to the metabolic syndrome and IHD. Our results challenge the proposition that the relationship between psychological well-being and biological cardiovascular risk indicators is a direct cause-effect phenomenon.",

Org 39141 is recombinant human cartilage glycoprotein-39, intended to induce mucosal tolerance upon intranasal administration. RA patients with moderate disease activity were treated for 4 weeks and followed for another 8 weeks. The trial had a sequential cohort design: RA patients in the first cohort received 4 intranasal doses (one per week) of either 25 microg Org 39141 or placebo; in subsequent cohorts, treatment with 125microg, 625 microg, or 3125 microg Org39141 was compared to placebo. Safety was evaluated by means of reporting adverse events, standard laboratory testing, and nose examination. The primary efficacy endpoint was RA disease activity as measured by the Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28). A total of 36 patients were randomized. Org39141 was well tolerated, and no severe or serious adverse events (AE) were reported. In the pooled placebo group, a decrease in DAS28 was observed, but to a lesser extent than in the Org 39141 treatment groups. After 4 weeks of treatment, the mean decrease in DAS in the 625 microg Org 39141 treatment group (-24%) was statistically (p = 0.02) and clinically (EULAR criteria) significantly larger than in the pooled placebo group (-3%). Once-weekly intranasal treatment with Org39141 was well tolerated, and no serious or severe AE were reported. A trend towards efficacy was observed. Our results are encouraging for further clinical development of Org39141.",

    "abstract": "There is uncertainty about the association between circulating concentrations of adiponectin and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. We report new data from a prospective study in the context of a meta-analysis of previously published prospective studies. We measured baseline adiponectin levels in stored serum samples of 589 men with fatal CHD or nonfatal myocardial infarction and in 1231 controls nested within a prospective study of 5661 men (aged 40 to 59 years) recruited during 1978-1980, as well as in paired samples obtained 4 years apart from 221 of these participants. Baseline adiponectin concentrations correlated (P &lt; 0.0001) positively with HDL cholesterol (r = 0.33) and inversely with C-reactive protein (r = -0.11) and BMI (r = -0.21), and the year-to-year consistency of adiponectin values was comparable to those of blood pressure and total cholesterol levels. No significant difference between median adiponectin levels at baseline was observed between cases and controls (10.2 versus 10.8 microg/mL; P = 0.5), despite the fact that body mass index, HDL, and C-reactive protein were all significant predictors of events in this cohort. The odds ratio for CHD was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.67 to 1.18) in a comparison of men in the top third of adiponectin concentrations compared with those in the bottom third, similar to a meta-analysis (including the present study) of 7 prospective studies involving a total of 1318 CHD cases (odds ratio, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.70 to 1.01]). In contrast to the strong associations previously reported between adiponectin levels and risk of type 2 diabetes, any association with CHD risk is comparatively moderate and requires further investigation.",

Forty-three healthy naturally postmenopausal women aged 43-65 years were randomly assigned to receive E2/NETA (2 mg E2 plus 1 mg NETA, n = 22) or placebo (n = 21). Fasting SLL by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, subcutaneous abdominal fat thickness (STh) by ultrasound and the anthropometric indices of body weight (BW), body mass index (BMI), waist and hip circumference (WC, HC) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were recorded at the beginning and the end of the study. After 6 months of therapy, BW and SLL increased in the placebo group (p = 0.043 and 0.033, respectively). WC, HC and STh decreased significantly in the E2/NETA group (p = 0.002, 0.006 and 0.000, respectively) and they were also significantly lower in women receiving E2/NETA than in women taking placebo (p = 0.000, 0.034 and 0.000, respectively). At baseline, SLL and STh were positively correlated with all anthropometric indices except WHR. Oral continuous combined regimen of E2/NETA significantly reduced central fat accumulation as assessed by WC and STh, and attenuated the increase in SLL. The observed changes in SLL were highly and positively related to changes in STh. The oral continuous combined E2/NETA regimen appears to have protective effects on cardiovascular function and probably on metabolic diseases by its slimming effect upon WC in postmenopausal women.",

    "abstract": "Adipose-derived cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, may contribute to the inflammation that occurs in the metabolic syndrome. We investigated the effects of inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha with etanercept in patients with the metabolic syndrome. Fifty-six subjects with the metabolic syndrome were randomized to administration of either etanercept or identical placebo, 50 mg subcutaneously once a week for 4 weeks. The C-reactive protein level was the primary end point. Effects on other inflammatory markers (including fibrinogen, interleukin 6, and adiponectin), insulin sensitivity, lipid levels, and body composition were also determined. Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups. Two subjects dropped out of each group, and etanercept was well tolerated throughout the study. The C-reactive protein levels decreased significantly in the treated compared with the placebo group (-2.4 +/- 0.4 vs 0.5 +/- 0.7 mg/L; P&lt;.001). Adiponectin levels rose significantly in the etanercept group compared with the placebo group (0.8 +/- 0.4 vs -0.3 +/- 0.3 microg/mL; P = .03). Fibrinogen levels decreased (-68 +/- 16 vs -2 +/- 31 mg/dL [-2.0 +/- 0.47 vs -0.06 +/- 0.91 micromol/L]; P = .04) and interleukin 6 levels tended to decrease (-1.2 +/- 0.8 vs 0.5 +/- 0.5 ng/L; P = .07) in the etanercept-treated subjects compared with placebo, respectively.

Etanercept reduces C-reactive protein levels and tends to improve other inflammatory cardiovascular risk indexes in patients with the metabolic syndrome.

Acute ghrelin administration reduces insulin secretion, whereas insulin infusion has been shown to decrease ghrelin levels. Whether ghrelin has any effect on glucose utilization in humans is unknown. Our objective was to reveal the effect of ghrelin on insulin-mediated glucose disposal in gastrectomized patients. STUDY AND SETTING: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, hospital-based study. Seven men and three women who all had a previous total gastrectomy and truncal vagotomy entered and completed the study. Each individual received infusion of saline alone or saline with ghrelin (5.0 pmol/kg.min) during a 5-h hyperinsulinemic (80 mU/m(2).min) euglycemic clamp on 2 separate days. We assessed glucose disposal rate and concentrations of C-peptide, ghrelin, GH, IGF-I, IGF-binding protein (IGFBP)-3 and -1, cortisol, leptin, and adiponectin. Glucose disposal rate decreased during ghrelin infusion (control study 8.6 +/- 0.2 vs. 7.2 +/- 0.1 mg/kg.min P &lt; 0.001). In experiments with saline infusion, levels of ghrelin (P &lt; 0.001), C-peptide (P &lt; 0.001), glucagon (P &lt; 0.001), adiponectin (P = 0.005), cortisol (P = 0.012), IGF-I (P &lt; 0.001), IGFBP-3 (P = 0.038), and IGFBP-1 (P = 0.001) fell in response to euglycemic hyperinsulinemia. GH concentration maintained at baseline, whereas leptin significantly rose (P &lt; 0.001). In the ghrelin infusion study, the plateau level of ghrelin concentration (6963.6 +/- 212.9 pg/ml) was maintained from 90 min throughout the experiment. GH (P &lt; 0.001) and cortisol (P = 0.04) concentrations rose, whereas C-peptide levels were more suppressed than in the control study (P &lt; 0.001). Other hormones and IGFBPs changed similarly as in the study with saline infusion. It appears that ghrelin might be involved in the negative control of insulin secretion and glucose consumption in gastrectomized patients, at least after acute administration.",

    "abstract": "Horses fed beyond their nutritional requirement and that are physically inactive will develop obesity, which is often accompanied by insulin resistance and heightened risk of laminitis. The use of pharmacologic agents in combination with nutritional restriction may promote weight loss in obese horses unable to exercise because of laminitic pain. This study shows that reducing feed intake of brome grass hay to 75% of ad libitum intake in obese pony mares reduces body weight without induced exercise. Additional supplementation of ractopamine hydrochloride for 6 weeks resulted in a tendency for increased weight loss. Subsequent modulation of obesity-associated hormones, leptin and insulin, as a result of caloric restriction was observed.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation contributes to cardiovascular disease and is exacerbated with increased adiposity, particularly omental adiposity; however, the role of epicardial fat is poorly understood. For these studies the expression of inflammatory markers was assessed in epicardial fat biopsies from coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) patients using quantitative RT-PCR. Further, the effects of chronic medications, including statins, as well as peri-operative glucose, insulin and potassium infusion, on gene expression were also assessed. Circulating resistin, CRP, adiponectin and leptin levels were determined to assess inflammation. The expression of adiponectin, resistin and other adipocytokine mRNAs were comparable to that in omental fat. Epicardial CD45 expression was significantly higher than control depots (p &lt; 0.01) indicating significant infiltration of macrophages. Statin treated patients showed significantly lower epicardial expression of IL-6 mRNA, in comparison with the control abdominal depots (p &lt; 0.001). The serum profile of CABG patients showed significantly higher levels of both CRP (control: 1.28 +/- 1.57 microg/mL vs CABG: 9.11 +/- 15.7 microg/mL; p &lt; 0.001) and resistin (control: 10.53 +/- 0.81 ng/mL vs CABG: 16.8 +/- 1.69 ng/mL; p &lt; 0.01) and significantly lower levels of adiponectin (control: 29.1 +/- 14.8 microg/mL vs CABG: 11.9 +/- 6.0 microg/mL; p &lt; 0.05) when compared to BMI matched controls. Epicardial and omental fat exhibit a broadly comparable pathogenic mRNA profile, this may arise in part from macrophage infiltration into the epicardial fat. This study highlights that chronic inflammation occurs locally as well as systemically potentially contributing further to the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease.",

    "abstract": "Addition of rosiglitazone to sulfonylurea has been shown to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes previously treated with sulfonylurea monotherapy alone. This investigation was performed to assess the specific impact of rosiglitazone on insulin resistance, beta-cell function, cardiovascular risk markers, and adiponectin secretion in this treatment concept. One hundred two patients from a double-blind, 3-arm comparator trial (group 0, glimepiride + placebo, n = 30; group 4, glimepiride + 4 mg rosiglitazone, n = 31; group 8, glimepiride + 8 mg rosiglitazone, n = 41; 48 women, 54 men; age [mean +/- SD], 62.8 +/- 9.1 years; body mass index, 28.7 +/- 4.5 kg/m2; diabetes duration, 6.4 +/- 4.8 years; HbA1c, 8.1% +/- 1.5%) were analyzed after 0 and 16 weeks of treatment. Observation parameters were HbA1c, glucose, homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance score, insulin, intact proinsulin, and adiponectin. Insulin resistance was defined by elevated intact proinsulin values or homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance score of more than 2. All parameters were comparable in the 3 groups at baseline. Substantial and significant dose-dependent improvements were observed after addition of rosiglitazone for fasting glucose (group 0, -9 +/- 48 mg/dL; group 4, -38 +/- 47 mg/dL; group 8, -46 +/- 53 mg/dL), HbA1c (-0.1% +/- 0.7%, -1.1% +/- 1.2%, -1.3% +/- 1.2%), insulin (1.4 +/- 6.2, -1.2 +/- 5.3, -3.7 +/- 9.9 microU/mL), intact proinsulin (1.6 +/- 7.1, -2.0 +/- 4.6, -3.1 +/- 6.1 pmol/L), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (0.2 +/- 2.6, -1.7 +/- 3.5, -2.1 +/- 3.5 mg/L). After adjustment for changes in body weight, significant increases in adiponectin were detected with rosiglitazone, whereas glimepiride alone did not induce a comparable effect (-0.5 +/- 5.8, 8.8 +/- 22.9, 14.3 +/- 19.9 mg/L). The number of insulin-resistant patients decreased in both rosiglitazone treatment groups, whereas no change was seen with glimepiride alone. Next to the reported effects on glucose control, rosiglitazone provided an additional beneficial effect on insulin resistance, beta-cell function, and cardiovascular risk markers. In conclusion, our short-term investigation of rosiglitazone action provides further experimental support for the rationale of combining rosiglitazone with sulfonylurea drugs in patients with type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "To investigate how variation in the dose of the progestogen influence the impact of 17beta-oestradiol plus drospirenone (DRSP) treatment on adipose tissue and its secretor function with direct implications for atherogenic metabolites. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Primary care, single study site. A total of 240 healthy postmenopausal women 53-65 years old, 178 completer. Daily treatment with 1 mg 17beta-oestradiol plus 1, 2, or 3 mg DRSP, or placebo for 2 years. Absolute changes in central (CFM) and peripheral fat mass (PFM; dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, DEXA), adipokines [interleukin (IL)-6 and adiponectin], atherogenic metabolites [triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), glucose] and blood pressure. Oestradiol plus 1 mg DRSP evoked significant decreases in CFM and the CFM/PFM ratio from baseline. These benefits virtually decreased with increasing dose of DRSP confounded by dose-dependent increases in CFM and PFM in smokers (P-value for trends &lt;0.001), in whom the increases in bioavailable oestradiol were half of that in nonsmokers (P &lt; 0.001). Treatment with 3 mg DRSP induced decreases in serum adiponectin by month 6 (P &lt; 0.05), which persisted in nonsmokers only and led to significant increases in glucose and triglycerides and decreases in HDL-C (P &lt; 0.05). Adiponectin in smokers normalized by the end of the study parallel with the increases in body fat mass. Interactions of the sex steroids with adipose tissue and its secretor function are important determinants of the overall impact of hormone therapy on cardiovascular risk. A DRSP dose up to 2 mg does not seem to exert adverse effects when combined with 1 mg 17beta-oestradiol.",

    "abstract": "The tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline (AMT) and the calcium channel blocker flunarizine are frequently used in the preventive treatment of migraine, but the side-effect of prominent weight gain that frequently emerges during preventive treatment of migraine with these agents often leads to the discontinuation of therapy. In this study, we aimed to investigate the possible relationship between the weight gain associated with the use of these agents and serum levels of leptin, C-peptide and insulin in patient with migraine. Forty-nine migraine patients with a body mass index (BMI) &lt; 25 and without any endocrinological, immunological or chronic diseases were randomly divided into two groups, receiving AMT or flunarizine. There was a statistically significant increase in serum levels of leptin, C-peptide, insulin and measures of BMI in both groups when measured at the 12th week of therapy compared to their respective basal levels. To our knowledge this is the first study investigating the effects of AMT and flunarizine on serum leptin levels in preventive use of migraine treatment. A result from this study indicates that AMT and flunarizine may cause leptin resistance possibly by different mechanisms and thereby result in increase in serum leptin levels and BMI.",

    "abstract": "Hypoadiponectinemia and chronic subclinical inflammation in adults are associated with the development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The potential relationship between adiponectin and inflammation and its modulation by lifestyle intervention in the pediatric obese population remain unclear. The objectives were to investigate in adolescents 1) the relationship between adiponectin and obesity-related inflammatory factors, C-reactive protein, and IL-6; and 2) the effect of a lifestyle intervention on adiponectin and whether these effects are related to changes in inflammatory factors. Twenty-one obese and age-matched lean adolescents (age, 14-18 yr; Tanner stage, &gt; or =IV) were studied cross-sectionally. Fifteen obese adolescents also underwent a randomized, controlled physical activity-behavior-diet-based lifestyle intervention for 3 months. Associations among adiponectin, fat mass, insulin resistance, and inflammatory factors at baseline as well as after the intervention were assessed. Plasma adiponectin concentration was lower (P &lt; 0.001) in the obese vs. age-matched lean adolescents. Significant inverse relationships were observed between adiponectin and inflammatory factors, insulinemia, insulin resistance, and fat mass. Intervention produced a 34% increase in adiponectin concentration (P = 0.0004) despite negligible weight loss but with reductions in fat mass, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and inflammatory factors (all P &lt; 0.01). The data suggest that in adolescents, obesity-related hypoadiponectinemia is associated with subclinical inflammation, and a short-term lifestyle intervention augments adiponectin concentrations. These effects appear to be related to reductions in fat mass and inflammatory factors. Based on our current understanding of adiponectin physiology, reversal of hypoadiponectinemia in obese adolescents may protect against risks for cardiovascular disease and diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Leptin is an important regulator of the mass of adipose tissue and of body weight; it operates by inhibiting food intake and stimulating energy expenditure. Some polymorphic genes involved in the regulation of leptin-the leptin gene (LEP A19G), the leptin receptor gene (LEPR Q223R, K109R, and K656N), and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma gene (PPARG P12A and C161T)--have been investigated as possible factors associated with obesity. Allelic frequencies of these polymorphisms show ethnic variation. The authors performed a meta-analysis of the available data on the association between these polymorphisms and obesity based on case-control studies. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for obesity associated with leptin polymorphisms were calculated by using both fixed- and random-effects models. Results suggest no evidence of association between the genes under study and obesity. The lack of association could be due to the complex pathogenesis of obesity, which involves a number of genetic and environmental factors. Large studies including testing of multiple genes in both obese and lean subjects, with epidemiologic data on dietary habits in different ethnic groups, are necessary to better understand the role of leptin in regulating weight in human populations.",

We hypothesize fenofibrate improves endothelial function by enhancing insulin sensitivity. We administered placebo or fenofibrate 200 mg daily for 8 weeks to 46 patients with primary hypertriglyceridemia (24 had metabolic syndrome). This study was randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, and crossover in design. Compared with placebo, fenofibrate decreased total cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and triglycerides and increased HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I (all P &lt; 0.001) while tending to decrease LDL cholesterol (P = 0.069). Fenofibrate significantly improved percent flow-mediated dilator response to hyperemia by 48 +/- 5% (P &lt; 0.001) and lowered plasma levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) relative to baseline measurements from 0.80 to 0.70 mg/l (P = 0.001) and fibrinogen levels by 16 +/- 3% (P &lt; 0.001).

Multivariate regression analysis showed that only changes in adiponectin levels persisted as an independent predictor of changes in flow-mediated dilation (r = 0.504, P = 0.013). Overall, we observed similar results in 24 patients with metabolic syndrome.

    "abstract": "This study examined the effects of exercise on metabolic risk variables insulin, leptin, glucose, and triglycerides in overweight/obese postmenopausal women. Sedentary women (n = 173) who were overweight or obese (BMI &gt; or = 25 kg/m(2) or &gt; or =24 kg/m(2) with &gt; or =33% body fat), 50 to 75 years of age, were randomized to 12 months of exercise (&gt; or =45 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity 5 d/wk) or to a stretching control group. Body composition (DXA) and visceral adiposity (computed tomography) were measured at baseline and 12 months. Insulin, glucose, triglycerides, and leptin were measured at baseline and 3 and 12 months. Insulin resistance was evaluated by the homeostasis model assessment formula. Differences from baseline to follow-up were calculated and compared across groups. Exercisers had a 4% decrease and controls had a 12% increase in insulin concentrations from baseline to 12 months (p = 0.0002). Over the same 12-month period, leptin concentrations decreased by 7% among exercisers compared with remaining constant among controls (p = 0.03). Homeostasis model assessment scores decreased by 2% among exercisers and increased 14% among controls from baseline to 12 months (p = 0.0005). The exercise effect on insulin was modified by changes in total fat mass (trend, p = 0.03), such that the exercise intervention abolished increases in insulin concentrations associated with gains in total fat mass. Regular moderate-intensity exercise can be used to improve metabolic risk variables such as insulin and leptin in overweight/obese postmenopausal women. These results are promising for health care providers providing advice to postmenopausal women for lifestyle changes to reduce risk of insulin resistance, coronary heart disease, and diabetes.",

    "title": "Neutrophil count in small-for-gestational age children: contrasting effects of metformin and growth hormone therapy.",
    "abstract": "A minority of children born small for gestational age (SGA) maintain a slow weight gain and a short stature (SS). At the other end of the spectrum are SGA children who show rapid postnatal weight gain and catch-up growth; these subjects may develop hyperinsulinemia, exaggerated adrenarche with precocious pubarche (PP), and an associated proinflammatory state with raised IL-6 and reduced adiponectin levels. Metformin therapy in SGA-PP girls attenuates the hyperinsulinemia, the adrenal androgen excess, and the proinflammatory state. In contrast, GH therapy in SGA-SS children promotes height gain but may induce hyperinsulinemia. Both groups are associated with increased risk markers for future cardiovascular disease. Therefore, we studied markers of inflammation in both SGA subpopulations at baseline and after their respectively corrective therapies. SGA-PP girls (n = 33; mean age, 8 yr; body mass index, 18.5 kg/m(2)) were randomized to remain untreated or to receive metformin (425 mg/d) for 6 months. SGA-SS children (n = 29; mean age, 7 yr; body mass index, 14.7 kg/m(2)) were randomly assigned to remain untreated or to receive GH (60 mug/kg/d). In SGA-PP girls, the mean neutrophil count (4.0 x 1000/mm(3)) was more than 2 sd above the mean reference level (2.8 x 1000/mm(3), P &lt; 0.001); this remained stable over 6 months in untreated girls but dropped in metformin-treated girls by -1.1 x 1000/mm(3) (P = 0.002). In SGA-SS children, neutrophil counts were also higher at baseline (3.3 x 1000/mm(3), P &lt; 0.01). This remained stable in untreated children but rose in GH-treated children by +1.1 x 1000/mm(3) (P = 0.004). GH-treated children also showed a rise in circulating IL-6 and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate levels and a fall in adiponectin levels. In conclusion, neutrophil counts were elevated in SGA children. In SGA girls with PP, the present results corroborate the antiinflammatory benefits of metformin therapy. In contrast, high-dose GH therapy in short SGA children may increase neutrophil counts and lead to a less favorable adipocytokine profile. Future studies with combined GH plus metformin treatment in short SGA children may clarify whether insulin resistance is a mechanism linking GH therapy to markers of inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Weight reduction on its own is observed to cause improvement in some of the abnormalities seen in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). With respect to this observation, we studied the possible effects of different serotonin reuptake inhibitors (fluoxetine and sibutramine) on serum leptin levels that might play a role in the obesity component seen in patients with PCOS. In a random design, sixteen patients were assigned to fluoxetine and sibutramine for a period of 10 days. In both treatment groups, no significant differences were observed between pre-treatment and post-treatment values in insulin levels (p &gt; 0.05). There was no significant difference between pretreatment and post-treatment serum leptin levels in the fluoxetine treatment group (p &gt; 0.05). However, a significant reduction was observed in the serum leptin levels at the end of treatment in the sibutramine group (p &lt; 0.05). The observed difference in the serum leptin response to the treatment effect of sibutramine compared to fluoxetine seems to be due to a mechanism independent of serotonin reuptake inhibition, possibly to the thermogenic effect of the sibutramine itself. Further studies with larger groups are warranted, to examine the mechanism of the weight-reducing effect of sibutramine. Detailed analyses of basal metabolic activity and change in serum leptin levels should be carried out.",

    "title": "Changes in sleep electroencephalogram and nocturnal hormone secretion after administration of the antidyskinetic agent sarizotan in healthy young male volunteers.",
    "abstract": "Sarizotan is a 5-HT(1A) agonist with high affinity to D(3) and D(4) receptors. In animal experiments, the drug shows a strong anti-cataleptic effect and suppresses effectively dyskinesias in animal models of L: -dopa-induced dyskinesia and of tardive dyskinesia. Data from an open pilot study in patients with Parkinson's disease show clear indication of a treatment effect against L: -dopa-induced dyskinesia. CNS-active drugs are known to modulate sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) and sleep-related hormone secretion. 5-HT(1A) agonists suppress rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep and enhance the secretion of ACTH, cortisol, prolactin and growth hormone (GH) at daytime. We hypothesised that sarizotan shares these effects. Furthermore, we were interested in the influence of sarizotan on leptin, which participates in the regulation of the energy balance and is enhanced after various psychoactive drugs. Ten healthy male subjects were investigated twice in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. Sleep EEG and nocturnal hormone secretion of ACTH, cortisol, prolactin, GH and leptin were examined after oral administration of either placebo or 20 mg of sarizotan at night. After administration of sarizotan, a significant reduction of REM sleep and total sleep time in conventional sleep EEG and a significant reduction of sigma- and theta-power in spectral analysis were observed. The main effect on nocturnal hormone secretion was a significant elevation of prolactin and of ACTH in the first half of the night. While REM sleep was suppressed, the endocrine effects of 20 mg sarizotan at night were weak. Its sleep-endocrine profile is comparable to the effects provoked by selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Obesity and growth hormone (GH) deficiency are common in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and these patients are at risk of metabolic diseases in adult life and of reduced life span. Low adiponectin values are associated with obesity and the metabolic syndrome. We therefore found it of interest to measure adiponectin levels in PWS. 17 adults, nine men and eight women, 17 to 32 years of age, with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 35+/-3.2 kg/m2 participated. All had clinical PWS. They were randomized to treatment with placebo or GH (Genotropin) for six months, and subsequently all received GH for 12 months. At baseline, serum total adiponectin levels in the PWS patients were compared with 25 lean and 34 obese controls. Body composition and various metabolic parameters, including adiponectin, were studied every six months in the PWS group. Serum adiponectin levels in PWS subjects were significantly lower (P&lt;0.001) compared with lean and significantly higher (P&lt;0.001) compared with obese controls. In PWS patients, no correlation was found between adiponectin and anthropometrical parameters or measures of insulin sensitivity (e.g. fasting insulin and insulin sensitivity as estimated by the homeostasis model assessment), or between adiponectin and IGF binding protein-1 or IGF-I. Adiponectin did not change during GH intervention. In this study of adults with PWS serum total adiponectin levels were higher than in controls with simple obesity and were independent of anthropometrical parameters. In accordance with this the metabolic syndrome is not necessarily present in all PWS patients. Correction of GH deficiency had no effect on serum adiponectin levels.",

    "abstract": "High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels are closely associated with adiposity and predict coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, relationships of CRP to adiponectin and other markers of insulin resistance have been inadequately researched in children. We measured fasting serum levels of adiponectin, insulin, hs-CRP, and lipoproteins, and recorded the anthropometric profile and percentage of body fat (%BF; bioimpedance method) in 62 (36 normal weight, 26 overweight) healthy, urban, postpubertal Asian Indian males (aged 14 to 18 years). Serum levels of adiponectin were lower (P = not significant [NS]), whereas those of fasting insulin (P = .01) and hs-CRP (P = .02) were higher in overweight subjects. Adiponectin levels inversely correlated with body mass index (BMI; r = -0.26, P &lt; .05), %BF (r = -0.24, P &lt; .05), fasting insulin (r = -0.32, P &lt; .05) and insulin resistance measured by the homeostasis model of assessment (HOMA-IR; r = -0.31, P &lt; .05), but not with hs-CRP levels. Fasting insulin and hs-CRP levels correlated significantly with BMI, %BF, waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip circumference ratio (W-HR), and triceps and subscapular skinfold thickness. The correlation of adiponectin with insulin sensitivity was independent of abdominal obesity, but became nonsignificant after controlling for BMI and %BF. Further, BMI was an independent predictor of adiponectin levels and the ratio of adiponectin and %BF was an independent predictor of fasting insulin levels. Although adiponectin levels did not correlate with hs-CRP levels, we observed dichotomous relationships of adiponectin and hs-CRP levels with generalized and abdominal obesity, respectively. We conclude that generalized obesity affects the adiponectin-insulin relationship in postpubertal Asian Indian males; however, the relationship of adiponectin with hs-CRP needs further evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Hyperproinsulinaemia reflects both beta cell dysfunction and insulin resistance in cross-sectional studies, but it is not known whether changes in proinsulin concentrations are related to insulin resistance over time. As trans10cis12 (t10c12)-conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) supplementation induces insulin resistance in obese men, we used this fatty acid to investigate the effects on plasma proinsulin, insulin, C-peptide and adiponectin concentrations, including their associations with change in insulin sensitivity. We randomised (double-blind) 57 non-diabetic abdominally obese men to receive either 3.4 g t10c12CLA, CLA-isomer mixture or control oil for 12 weeks. Insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp), intact proinsulin, insulin, the proinsulin : insulin ratio, C-peptide, glucose and adiponectin were assessed before and after supplementation. Supplementation with t10c12CLA increased proinsulin (p&lt;0.01), the proinsulin : insulin ratio (p&lt;0.05) and C-peptide concentrations (p&lt;0.001) in comparison with control subjects. Adiponectin, however, did not change significantly. The change in proinsulin, but not the proinsulin : insulin ratio, was related to impaired insulin sensitivity (r= -0.58, p&lt;0.0001), independently of changes in insulin, C-peptide, glucose, adiponectin and BMI. Conversely, the correlation between insulin sensitivity and specific insulin (r=-0.46, p&lt;0.001) did not remain significant after adjustment for proinsulin. Induced hyperproinsulinaemia was also correlated to adiponectin concentrations ( r= -0.34, p&lt;0.01). In obese men, t10c12CLA induces hyperproinsulinaemia that is related to impaired insulin sensitivity, independently of changes in insulin concentrations. These results are of clinical interest, as hyperproinsulinaemia predicts diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The use of weight-loss supplements containing this fatty acid is worrying.",

    "title": "Ethinylestradiol-drospirenone, flutamide-metformin, or both for adolescents and women with hyperinsulinemic hyperandrogenism: opposite effects on adipocytokines and body adiposity.",
    "abstract": "Hyperinsulinemic hyperandrogenism with anovulation, the so-called polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), is the most frequent endocrine disorder of young women. One of the stigmata of PCOS is a deficit of lean mass and an excess of fat, in particular, abdominal fat, even in the absence of obesity. Adiponectin and IL-6 are among the adipocytokines that have recently been related to abdominal fat excess, insulin resistance states, and cardiovascular disease risk. We studied the effects of two new treatment options, ethinylestradiol-drospirenone and flutamide-metformin, and of their combination on adipocytokinemia and body adiposity in adolescents and women with PCOS. Adolescents with PCOS (n = 32; age, approximately 15 yr; body mass index, approximately 22 kg/m(2)) were randomly assigned to receive the oral contraceptive (OC) ethinylestradiol-drospirenone, or the low-dose generic duo of flutamide (62.5 mg/d) plus metformin (850 mg/d). Young women with PCOS (n = 22; age, approximately 19 yr; body mass index, approximately 22 kg/m(2)) were randomized to receive the same OC, either alone or with flutamide-metformin. Fasting blood glucose, serum insulin, lipids, androgens, IL-6, adiponectin, and body composition (by absorptiometry) were assessed at the start, and after 3 and/or 9 months. At the start, serum concentrations of the proinflammatory IL-6 were high, and those of the antiinflammatory adiponectin were low; body composition was adipose in each subpopulation. Abnormal adipocytokine levels, hypertriglyceridemia, and body adiposity diverged further from the norm in adolescents on OC; in contrast, girls on flutamide-metformin reverted all study indices toward normal, lost part of their fat excess, and reduced their lean mass deficit. In comparison to the girls on OC, those on flutamide-metformin lost a mean of approximately 4 kg of fat and gained approximately 4 kg of lean mass. Similarly, abnormal adipocytokine levels and adiposity were aggravated in women on OC alone and improved in women on OC plus flutamide-metformin; within 9 months, the latter subgroup lost a mean of approximately 3 kg of fat and gained approximately 3 kg of lean mass, in comparison to women on OC alone. In conclusion, young and nonobese PCOS patients were found to be in a low-grade, chronic inflammation state, and to have a body adiposity that evolves according to the balance of circulating adipocytokines and lipids, rather than to androgen excess or fasting hyperinsulinemia. Monotherapy with ethinylestradiol-drospirenone may not be a prime choice for PCOS, given its inefficacy to attenuate abnormal adipocytokine levels and body adiposity; ethinylestradiol-drospirenone plus flutamide-metformin, however, is a first OC combination that was found capable of reverting both the adipocytokine balance and the body composition toward normal, and that may therefore improve the long-term cardiovascular perspectives of women with PCOS.",

    "abstract": "Osteopenia and excess adiposity occur following treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and the use of cranial irradiation is thought to be a significant contributory factor. Hyperleptinaemia has also been demonstrated following cessation of treatment for childhood ALL. Therefore a prospective study was undertaken to evaluate serial changes in percentage bone mineral content (BMC), adiposity and serum leptin concentrations during 2 years of treatment of children with ALL with chemotherapy but without cranial irradiation. Only patients treated using the MRC ALL 97/ALL 97 (modified 99) protocols for childhood ALL were eligible for entry into the study. A total of 14 patients (seven male, with a median age of 7.5 years (range 3.4-16.7 years) were recruited. Serial dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scanning was undertaken at diagnosis and during two years of treatment. Serum leptin concentrations were determined at the same time as the scans. Reductions in %BMC were observed at the hip and lumbar spine by 12 months (P &lt; 0.01) and remained low after 24 months of treatment. Subanalysis of %BMC measurements at the hip demonstrated a greater reduction in %BMC at the trochanteric region compared to the femoral neck. The percentage corrected fat mass increased from 6 months whereas the body mass index (BMI) standard deviation score (SDS) was increased after 24 months of treatment (P &lt; 0.05). Serum leptin concentrations increased following 24 months of therapy (P &lt; 0.05). Children treated for ALL with contemporary regimens have a predisposition to osteopenia, excess adiposity and hyperleptinaemia during treatment without cranial irradiation administration. We speculate that in addition to glucocorticoid administration, leptin resistance may account in part for these observations.",

We analyzed serum glucose and lipid variables and serum IL-8, IL-18, and adiponectin concentrations at baseline and at 2 and 4 h after ingestion of the meals. Compared with nondiabetic subjects, diabetic patients had higher fasting IL-8 (P &lt; 0.05) and IL-18 (P &lt; 0.01) concentrations and lower adiponectin concentrations (P &lt; 0.01) at baseline. In both nondiabetic and diabetic subjects, IL-18 concentrations increased and adiponectin concentrations decreased (P &lt; 0.05) from baseline concentrations after consumption of the high-fat meal. After consumption of the high-carbohydrate, high-fiber meal, serum IL-18 concentrations decreased from baseline concentrations (P &lt; 0.05) in both nondiabetic and diabetic subjects; adiponectin concentrations decreased after the high-carbohydrate, low-fiber meal in diabetic patients. IL-8 concentrations did not change significantly after consumption of any of the 3 meals. This study provides evidence that circulating IL-18 and adiponectin concentrations are modulated by familiar foodstuffs in humans. Meal modulation of cytokines involved in atherogenesis may represent a safe strategy for ameliorating atherogenetic inflammatory activity in diabetic patients.",

    "abstract": "We examined serum leptin levels in a controlled feeding and alcohol ingestion study to elucidate potential mechanisms by which alcohol may affect cancer and immunologically related health risks. A total of 53 healthy, nonsmoking postmenopausal women completed a random-order, three-period crossover design study in which each woman received zero (0 g of alcohol), one (15 g of alcohol), or two (30 g alcohol) drinks per day. After accounting for differences in body mass index, women who consumed 15 or 30 g of alcohol per day had 7.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.0% to 15.1%) and 8.9% (95% CI = 1.6% to 16.7%) higher serum leptin levels, respectively (P(trend) =.018), than women who consumed 0 g of alcohol per day. Younger women (i.e., 49-54 years) demonstrated a statistically significantly larger association of alcohol consumption level with the increase in serum leptin levels than older women (i.e., 55-79 years) (24.4%, 95% CI = 9.3% to 42.0% versus 3.7%, 95% CI = -4.1% to 12.1% increase in serum leptin levels for 30 g of alcohol per day relative to 0 g of alcohol per day for the lowest age quartile compared with the three highest age quartiles combined; P =.022). These results indicate that moderate alcohol consumption (15-30 g of alcohol per day) increases serum leptin levels in postmenopausal women and may predispose moderate drinkers to the morbidities associated with chronic elevations of this hormone including cancer.",

    "abstract": "In the present study, the relationship between plasma leptin and other cardiovascular risk factors in high-risk postmenopausal women was assessed, as well as the effect of transdermal 17beta-estradiol unopposed or in combination with intermittent medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) on plasma leptin. Postmenopausal women (n = 118) with coronary artery disease (CAD) were consecutively recruited from women admitted to hospital for coronary angiography. They were randomized to estradiol plus intermittent MPA or to a control group, and investigated at study inclusion, and after 3 and 12 months. A strong relationship was found between leptin and body mass index (r = 0.69, p &lt; 0.001). Leptin was related to lipid fractions (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol: r = -0.33, p &lt; 0.001; apolipoprotein A: r = -0.28, p = 0.004; and triglycerides: r = 0.27, p = 0.003) and indices of glucose metabolism (C-peptide: r = 0.47, p &lt; 0.001; fasting insulin: r = 0.42, p &lt; 0.001; glucose: r = 0.25, p = 0.008; insulin resistance: r = 0.45, p &lt; 0.001; and insulin secretion: r = 0.36, p &lt; 0.001). In a multiple regression model, only body mass index (p &lt; 0.001) and C-peptide (p = 0.002) remained as independent factors for leptin levels. Despite the association with sex hormone-binding globulin (r = 0.30, p = 0.001), no effect on leptin levels was observed with either unopposed transdermal estradiol or estradiol combined with MPA. Plasma leptin is related to other cardiovascular risk factors in postmenopausal women with CAD, but seems to be unaffected by transdermal 17beta-estradiol administration.",

    "abstract": "To compare the effects of a standard American diet, a traditional low-fat diet, and a low-fat diet containing the fat substitute olestra on risk factors for heart disease and diabetes. A 9-month, double-blind, randomized, parallel-arm, feeding study comparing three diets: (1). control (33% fat), (2). fat-reduced (FR; 25% fat), and (3). fat-substituted (FS) where olestra replaced 1/3 of dietary fat (33% lipid and 25% digestible fat). Subjects were allowed to adjust their total energy intake as desired, allowing weight to fluctuate. A total of 37 healthy, obese men (age 36.7+/-1.3 y; body mass index 30.8+/-0.4 kg/m(2)). Body weight and composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, blood pressure, serum lipids, lipoproteins, hemostatic factors, glucose, insulin, and leptin at baseline and every 3 months. The FS group lost 6.27 kg of body weight by 9 months vs 4.0 kg in the control and 1.79 kg in the FR groups. There was a significant diet main effect on cholesterol (P=0.002), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P=0.003), and triglycerides (P=0.01), all of which decreased in the FS group but not the other groups by 9 months. Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) increased in the FR and control groups but was unchanged in the FS group (diet main effect P=0.04). High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol increased in all groups over 9 months (time main effect P=0.0001). Time main effects were also observed for cholesterol, ApoA1, ApoB, Factor VII, diastolic blood pressure, and glucose. After adjustment for % fat loss at 9 months, the effects of diet on change in risk factors remained significant only for triglycerides. Consumption of a low-fat diet containing olestra for 9 months produced significant improvement in cardiovascular risk factors, an effect largely explained by weight loss. Long-term low-fat diet consumption with or without olestra does not decrease HDL cholesterol.",

These subjects are thought to exhibit autonomic dysregulation of the beta-cell, with insulin hypersecretion in response to oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT). We report the results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of octreotide therapy for pediatric hypothalamic obesity. Eighteen subjects [weight, 100.6 +/- 5.6 kg; body mass index (BMI), 37.1 +/- 1.3 kg/m(2)] received octreotide (5-15 microg/kg x d s.c.) or placebo for 6 months. With octreotide, Delta weight (mean +/- SEM) was +1.6 +/- 0.6 vs. +9.1 +/- 1.7 kg for placebo (P &lt; 0.001). Delta BMI was -0.2 +/- 0.2 vs. +2.2 +/- 0.5 kg/m(2), respectively (P &lt; 0.001). OGTT documented Delta insulin response (peak - basal) of -417 +/- 304 pM after octreotide vs. +216 +/- 215 pM after placebo (P = 0.034). Improvement in physical activity by parent report was noted with octreotide, but not placebo (P = 0.03). For the octreotide group, changes in quality of life positively correlated with changes in insulin response (P = 0.041). Complications and adverse events were mild and self-limited. These data demonstrate the beneficial effects of octreotide in pediatric hypothalamic obesity. Octreotide suppressed insulin, and stabilized weight and BMI. Improved quality of life correlated with the degree of insulin suppression. Octreotide was safe and well tolerated.",

To determine the effect of a program of changes in lifestyle designed to obtain a sustained reduction of body weight on markers of systemic vascular inflammation and insulin resistance. Randomized single-blind trial conducted from February 1999 to February 2002 at a university hospital in Italy. One hundred twenty premenopausal obese women (body mass index &gt; or =30) aged 20 to 46 years without diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia. The 60 women randomly assigned to the intervention group received detailed advice about how to achieve a reduction of weight of 10% or more through a low-energy Mediterranean-style diet and increased physical activity. The control group (n = 60) was given general information about healthy food choices and exercise. Lipid and glucose intake; blood pressure; homeostatic model assessment of insulin sensitivity; and circulating levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 18 (IL-18), C-reactive protein (CRP), and adiponectin. After 2 years, women in the intervention group consumed more foods rich in complex carbohydrates (9% corrected difference; P&lt;.001), monounsaturated fat (2%; P =.009), and fiber (7 g/d; P&lt;.001); had a lower ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids (-5; P&lt;.001); and had lower energy (-310 kcal/d; P&lt;.001), saturated fat (-3.5%; P =.007), and cholesterol intake (-92 mg/d; P&lt;.001) than controls.

In multivariate analyses, changes in free fatty acids (P =.008), IL-6 (P =.02), and adiponectin (P =.007) levels were independently associated with changes in insulin sensitivity.

    "abstract": "Leptin - produced predominantly by adipocytes - is presumably also involved in pathogenesis of essential hypertension (EH). In the present study, we addressed the question whether and to what extent antihypertensive monotherapy does influence leptinemia in patients with mild or moderate EH. Forty-two EH patients were enrolled in this randomized, open-labeled study. In all subjects, plasma concentrations of leptin, insulin, glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides and creatinine were estimated twice - before and one month after initiation of monotherapy with perindopril, pindolol or felodipin, respectively. Plasma leptin concentration, in the afternoon and midnight, was significantly higher in patients with essential hypertension than in normotensive healthy subjects (p &lt; 0.01). Therapy with perindopril or felodipin did not influence the daily profile of leptinemia or insulinemia, respectively. However, pindolol monotherapy showed a marked (p &lt; 0.01) suppressive effect on the daily profile of leptinemia, but did not influence insulinemia. First, patients with essential hypertension are characterized by higher plasma leptin levels as compared with normotensive healthy subjects; second, suppressive effect of pindolol on leptinemia may be of pathophysiological relevance in the course of weight gain during beta-blocker therapy.",

    "abstract": "Natural progesterone, a potent respiratory stimulant, stimulates leptin production in premenopausal females. Leptin and its counterpart neuropeptide Y (NPY) have recently been linked with respiration. The effect of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) on arterial blood gases, serum leptin and NPY was evaluated in this study. Fourteen postmenopausal females with respiratory impairment, due mostly to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, were recruited for a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial. Arterial blood gases, serum leptin and NPY concentrations were measured at baseline and after 14 days of treatment with placebo and MPA, separated by a 6-week washout period. Thirteen patients completed the trial. The mean+/-SD carbon dioxide tension in arterial blood (Pa,CO2) was 5.4+/-0.6 kPa at baseline, and decreased by 0.8+/-0.3 kPa during treatment with MPA. The oxygen tension in arterial blood (Pa,O2) and pH did not change. At baseline, the mean base excess was 0.6+/-1.9 mmol x L(-1) and the mean bicarbonate (HCO3-) concentration was 25.1+/-1.6 mmol x L(-1). With MPA, base excess decreased by 2.2+/-1.2 mmol x L(-1) and HCO3- by 1.9+/-1.0 mmol x L(-1) from baseline. The mean concentrations of serum leptin (19.8+/-9.9 microg x L(-1) at baseline, 19.7+/-9.8 microg x L(-1) with MPA) or NPY (94.0+/-18.3 pmol x L(-1) at baseline, 85.1+/-41.2 pmol x L(-1) with MPA) did not change. However, the reduction in Pa,CO2 correlated with the reduction of serum leptin concentration. Medroxyprogesterone acetate effectively decreased the carbon dioxide tension in postmenopausal females with chronic respiratory impairment. The results suggest that a decrease in the carbon dioxide tension of &gt; or = 0.9 kPa is necessary for a reduction in serum leptin concentration.",

Estrogen replacement therapy decreased body fat mass as well as intra-abdominal and intrapelvic fat, but not the subcutaneous fat compartments. LDL cholesterol decreased and HDL cholesterol increased, whereas triglycerides were not changed by one year of estrogen treatment. Insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance were not affected by estrogen treatment. In postmenopausal women estrogen treatment for one year decreased intra-abdominal and intrapelvic fat compartments, but this was not related to changes in plasma lipid levels.

    "abstract": "To evaluate whether a 5-week low-glycemic index (LGI) diet versus a high-glycemic index (HGI) diet can modify glucose and lipid metabolism as well as total fat mass in nondiabetic men. In this study, 11 healthy men were randomly allocated to 5 weeks of an LGI or HGI diet separated by a 5-week washout interval in a crossover design. The LGI diet resulted in lower postprandial plasma glucose and insulin profiles and areas under the curve (AUCs) than the HGI diet. A 5-week period of the LGI diet lowered plasma triacylglycerol excursion after lunch (AUC, P &lt; 0.05 LGI vs. HGI). These modifications were associated with a decrease in the total fat mass by approximately 700 g (P &lt; 0.05) and a tendency to increase lean body mass (P &lt; 0.07) without any change in body weight. This decrease in fat mass was accompanied by a decrease in leptin, lipoprotein lipase, and hormone-sensitive lipase RNAm quantities in the subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (P &lt; 0.05). We concluded that 5 weeks of an LGI diet ameliorates some plasma lipid parameters, decreases total fat mass, and tends to increase lean body mass without changing body weight. These changes were accompanied by a decrease in the expression of some genes implicated in lipid metabolism. Such a diet could be of benefit to healthy, slightly overweight subjects and might play a role in the prevention of metabolic diseases and their cardiovascular complications.",

Fatness parameters, measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, lipid profile, insulin, leptin, sex steroid hormones and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels were compared at baseline and 1 year after the beginning of the study. The data showed that plasma SHBG levels, but not testosterone levels, correlated negatively to fasting insulin levels and positively to HDL-cholesterol in both men and women. Total leptin levels were significantly lower (P&lt;0.0001) in post-BPD subjects of both sexes compared to dietary treated obese subjects. The logarithm of plasma leptin correlated significantly and positively with insulin but negatively with SHBG.A step-down regression analysis showed that FFM and SHBG, but not insulin levels, were the most powerful independent variables for predicting HDL-cholesterol levels in morbidly obese patients. The negative relationship between SHBG levels and CHD risk appears to be mediated by a concomitant variation in body fatness. Finally, in obese patients, SHBG levels seem to be an indicator of total adiposity rather than an index of an altered insulin/glucose homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin, a plasma protein exclusively synthesized and secreted by adipose tissue, has recently been shown to have anti-inflammatory, antiatherogenic properties in vitro and beneficial metabolic effects in animals. Lower plasma levels of adiponectin have been documented in human subjects with metabolic syndrome and coronary artery disease. We investigated whether the level of this putative protective adipocytokine could be increased by treatment with a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonist in diabetic patients. Type 2 diabetic patients (30 in the treatment group and 34 in the placebo group) were recruited for a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial for 6 months with the PPAR-gamma agonist rosiglitazone. Blood samples were collected and metabolic variables and adiponectin levels were determined in all patients before initiation of the study. In the rosiglitazone group, mean plasma adiponectin level was increased by more than twofold (P &lt; 0.0005), whereas no change was observed in the placebo group. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that whether rosiglitazone was used was the single variable significantly related to the changes of plasma adiponectin. The amount of variance in changes of plasma adiponectin level explained by the treatment was approximately 24% (r(2) = 0.24) after adjusting for age, sex, and changes in fasting plasma glucose, HbA(1c), insulin resistance index, and BMI. Rosiglitazone increases plasma adiponectin levels in type 2 diabetic subjects. Whether this may contribute to the antihyperglycemic and putative antiatherogenic benefits of PPAR-gamma agonists in type 2 diabetic patients warrants further investigation.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the study was to assess response rate, clinical outcome, organ/function preservation and toxicity in head and neck cancer patients treated with induction chemotherapy followed by concomitant chemoradiotherapy and, when necessary, limited surgery. The study design was a phase II non-randomized trial in hospitalized patients setting. The treatment plan consisted of 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy with cisplatin, fluorouracil (5-FU), l-leucovorin and interferon alpha2b (PFL-IFN) followed by 7 cycles of 5-FU, hydroxyurea and concomitant radiation for 5 days (FHX) for a total radiation dose of 70 Gy. 13 Cis-retinoic acid was added to treatment regimen for chemoprevention and a systematic prophylaxis of mucositis was administered to all patients during FHX. Conservative surgical resection was reserved to patients with no optimal response (PR &gt; or =70%), whereas radical surgery was performed as salvage treatment. Twenty-six patients were treated at one institution: more than 90% had stage IV disease and only 19.2% had laryngeal cancer. Eighty-one percent of patients had performance status 0 and 23.1% of patients had &gt;5% weight loss at the start of treatment. Nineteen patients were analyzed for response to PFL-IFN: 3/19 (15.8%) patients achieved a CR and 7/19 (36.8%) achieved a PR for an ORR of 52.6%. FHX was administered on protocol to 12 patients: 6 patients (50%) had CR, 1 patient (8.3%) had PR for an ORR of 58.3%, 2 patients (16.7%) had SD and 3 patients (25%) had PD. At the completion of FHX, no patient underwent local therapy according to treatment plan. At a median follow-up time of 13.5 months (range 1-28+) at June 2001, among 26 patients enrolled 12 (46.1%) were still alive and 9 (75%) of them were progression-free. The median duration of response was 9 months (range 0-25+), the median progression-free survival was 10.5 months (range 0-28+), the median overall survival time was 9 months (range 1-22). The toxicity was significant and consisted mainly of mucositis and, to a lesser extent, neutropenia/thrombocytopenia. In the present study, the low serum levels of leptin and the high serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines in advanced stage cancer patients were confirmed. In conclusion, this sequential induction chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy program has been found moderately active and significantly toxic; moreover, the long overall treatment duration must be taken into consideration. For these reasons, this regimen could not be recommended for a phase III randomized study.",

    "abstract": "Studies in animals and humans using supraphysiological doses of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) reported significant changes in body composition and carbohydrate metabolism. To investigate the metabolic action of a physiological DHEA replacement dose, we studied 24 women with adrenal insufficiency (AI; mean +/- SD age, 42.3 +/- 9.3 yr; duration of disease, 9.2 +/- 8.4 yr; body mass index, 23.4 +/- 4.0 kg/m(2)) in a double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, cross-over design. They received 50 mg DHEA/day and placebo orally for 4 months each, with a 1 -month washout period. Measurements included fasting serum glucose, insulin, leptin, bone markers, anthropometric parameters determined by bioimpedance analysis, and exercise capacity as assessed by an incremental cycling test. DHEA did not induce any change in body mass index (placebo vs. DHEA, 23.3 +/- 4.1 vs. 23.2 +/- 3.9 kg/m(2); P = 0.39), parameters of body composition, or exercise capacity. However, compared with placebo, DHEA replacement led to a significant decrease in serum leptin (absolute change after 4 months, DHEA vs. placebo, -5.3 +/- 8.0 vs. 1.1 +/- 5.7 ng/mL; P = 0.01). This is most likely the result of the DHEA-induced normalization of circulating androgens. DHEA had no effect on fasting glucose, insulin, or the glucose/insulin ratio. Compared with placebo, serum osteocalcin increased slightly, but significantly, during DHEA treatment (absolute change after 4 months DHEA vs. placebo, +1.6 +/- 5.3 vs. -1.2 +/- 6.2 ng/mL; P = 0.02). However, urinary cross-links excretion did not change. In conclusion, replacement of DHEA in a physiological dose in patients with pathological DHEA deficiency does not have a significant effect on carbohydrate metabolism, body composition, or exercise capacity. The biological relevance of the changes in leptin and osteocalcin levels remains to be determined.",

We wanted to examine whether changes in dietary energy sources and exercise-mediated energy expenditure, alone or in combination, affect plasma leptin concentrations. In a randomized, 2 x 2 factorial trial, 186 men with metabolic syndrome were divided into 4 groups: diet, exercise, a combination of diet and exercise, and control. Data on dietary intake, physical fitness, and demographics were collected and plasma leptin concentrations were measured before and after a 1-y intervention period. Plasma leptin concentrations, body mass index, and fat mass decreased in association with long-term reductions in food intake as well as increased physical activity. By adjusting for either body mass index or fat mass, we observed a highly significant reduction in plasma leptin concentration after both the diet and the exercise interventions. There was no interaction between the interventions, suggesting a direct and additive effect of changes in diet and physical activity on plasma leptin concentrations. Long-term changes in lifestyle consisting of decreased intake of dietary fat and increased physical activity reduced plasma leptin concentrations in humans beyond the reduction expected as a result of changes in fat mass.",

    "title": "Increased leptin levels in serum and peritoneal fluid of patients with pelvic endometriosis.",
    "abstract": "Pelvic endometriosis is an immune-related chronic inflammatory disease, characterized by ectopic implants of endometrium in the peritoneal cavity and associated with increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and neoangiogenesis. Leptin, the adipocyte-derived hormone, has been shown to have a role in food intake, basal metabolism, and reproductive function. Leptin levels are dynamically regulated, being elevated by inflammatory mediators and reduced by starvation. Leptin itself can influence the proinflammatory immune responses of CD4+ T lymphocytes, and reports have also shown this hormone to be an angiogenic factor in vitro and in vivo. We investigated whether leptin concentrations in serum and peritoneal fluid (PF) differed between 13 patients with different stages of endometriosis and 15 age- and body mass index-matched controls. We found a statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) increase in leptin levels in serum (30.3 +/- 14.8 ng/mL) and PF (35.9 +/- 17.4 ng/mL) of patients with endometriosis, compared with our control population (serum, 15.6 +/- 8.4; PF, 17.5 +/- 7.2 ng/mL). Regression equations, relating leptin to body mass index, were also significantly different in endometriosis patients, compared with controls. Higher levels of leptin were observed in the earlier stages of endometriosis than advanced-stage disease. These data suggest that the proinflammatory and neoangiogenic actions of leptin may contribute to the pathogenesis of endometriosis.",

    "title": "Dose-dependent cortisol-induced increases in plasma leptin concentration in healthy humans.",
    "abstract": "Leptin is a hormone that regulates fat metabolism and appetite. The secretion of leptin is regulated by adiposity and, in the rodent, by factors such as insulin, beta-adrenergic agonists, and glucocorticoids (GCs). Increased secretion of the endogenous human GC, cortisol, occurs during stress and in disorders such as major depression. Pharmacological GCs can robustly increase plasma leptin concentrations in humans, leading us to hypothesize that cortisol may serve as a physiological regulator of human leptin secretion. A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled comparison of 2 fixed oral dosages of cortisol (40 mg/d and 160 mg/d), given for 4 days to matched groups of healthy subjects (n=47). Low-dose treatment approximated GC output during mild stress, while high-dose treatment approximated GC output during maximal stress, spanning a range of GC secretion relevant to physiological stress. Cortisol produced dose-dependent and time-dependent increases in plasma leptin concentrations (time x treatment condition x body mass index; F6,123=10.73; P&lt;.001). Initial treatment-induced increases in plasma leptin concentration returned toward baseline values during 4 treatment days, suggesting tolerance to this GC effect in these healthy subjects. The results indicate an important role for GCs in the short-term regulation of human leptin secretion. Glucocorticoid-induced increases in leptin secretion suggest a mechanism that may contribute to anorexia and weight loss during stress and disease states such as major depression, if these conditions are associated with sustained increases in plasma leptin concentrations.",

    "abstract": "Stimulation of beta3-adrenoceptors by selective agonists improves insulin action and stimulates energy metabolism in various rodent models of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Whether selective beta3-adrenoceptor stimulation exerts metabolic actions in humans remains to be proven. The effects of a highly selective beta3-adrenoceptor agonist on insulin action, energy metabolism, and body composition were assessed in 14 healthy young lean male volunteers (age 22.5 +/- 3.3 years, 15 +/- 5% body fat [mean +/- SD]) randomly assigned to 8 weeks of treatment with either 1,500 mg/day of CL 316,243 (n = 10) or placebo (n = 4). Insulin-mediated glucose disposal (IMGD), nonoxidative glucose disposal (NOGD), oxidative glucose disposal (OGD) (indirect calorimetry), and splanchnic glucose output (SGO; beta3-[H3]glucose) were determined during a 100-min hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic glucose clamp (40 mU x m(-2) x min(-1)) before and after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. The 24-h energy expenditure (24-EE), 24-h respiratory quotient (24-RQ), and the oxidation rates of fat and carbohydrate were determined in a respiratory chamber before and after 8 weeks. After 4 weeks, treatment with CL 316,243 increased IMGD (+45%, P &lt; 0.01) in a plasma concentration-dependent manner (r = 0.76, P &lt; 0.02). This effect was due to an 82% increase in NOGD (P &lt; 0.01), while OGD and SGO remained unchanged. The effects on insulin action were markedly diminished after 8 weeks; this was significantly related to an unexpected decline in the plasma concentrations of CL 316,243 (-36%, P = 0.08). At this time, 24-RQ was lowered (P &lt; 0.001), corresponding to a 23% increase in fat oxidation (P &lt; 0.01) and a 17% decrease in carbohydrate oxidation (P = 0.05). The 24-EE after 8 weeks did not differ from baseline, and there was no change in body weight or body composition. Plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, and leptin were unaffected by treatment, while free fatty acid concentrations increased by 41% (P &lt; 0.05), again linearly with the achieved plasma concentration of CL 316,243 (r = 0.67, P &lt; 0.05). Treatment with CL 316,243 had no effect on heart rate or blood pressure and caused no cases of tremors. We conclude that treatment of lean male subjects with CL 316,243 increases insulin action and fat oxidation, both in a plasma concentration-dependent manner. This is the first study to demonstrate unequivocal metabolic effects of a highly selective beta3-adrenoceptor agonist in humans.",

We also examined the predictive potential of ADP and estimate progression of DN. Multi-database literature searches and serial omissions of articles yielded 13 studies for inclusion in the meta-analysis. We compared ADP levels between controls/ normoalbuminuria and cases with micro- and macroalbuminuria (MI and MA, respectively) as well as MI versus MA using standardized mean differences (SMD). Associations of ADP with DN were indicated with the P-value considered significant at &#x2264; 0.05. Subgrouping was based on diabetes type (1 and 2). Predictive potential of ADP was explored with AUC (area under the curve) derived from Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis. At high P-values of &lt;10-5, overall and subgroup outcomes indicated ADP associations with DN (up to SMD = 1.89-2.26, respectively). However, heterogeneity of the initial SMD effects (up to I2 = 99%) warranted examination of their sources which with the Galbraith plot method, either eliminated or reduced their heterogeneity, signifying combinability of the studies. This feature along with consistency of significant associations, robust outcomes and significant AUC values provide good evidence of the associative and predictive roles of ADP in DN.",

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate if the supplementation of omega-3 with LI could improve metabolic and endothelial abnormality in obese adolescents with hypertriglyceridemia. The study involved sixty-nine adolescents with normal weight and seventy obese adolescents with hypertriglyceridemia. All obese adolescents were applied to LI and randomly assigned to omega-3 supplementation or placebo group for 12 weeks. The obese adolescents with hypertriglyceridemia presented increased levels of leptin, retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4), selectin E (sE) and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and decreased levels of adiponectin compared with control subjects. After 12-week intervention, omega-3 supplementation with LI decreased significantly in triglycerides, HOMA, leptin, RBP4, ADMA and sE. Moreover, omega-3 with LI displayed a significant reduction in triglycerides, ADMA and sE in comparison with LI alone. In subjects with omega-3 combined with LI assessed by multivariate regression model, the reduction in triglycerides was the only independent determinant of the decrease in ADMA. The reductions in triglycerides and HOMA were significantly contributed to the changes in sE. Our data indicated that omega-3 combined with LI in short duration significantly improved dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, abnormality of adipokines, endothelial dysfunction in comparison of LI alone, indicating the combined approach is an effective clinical and applicable strategy to control metabolic abnormality and decrease the risks of cardiovascular diseases in obese adolescents.",

    "abstract": "Whether adiponectin (ADIPOQ) polymorphisms are associated with the risk of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) remain controversial. Therefore, we performed this study to better explore correlations between ADIPOQ polymorphisms and PCOS risk. Literature retrieve was conducted in PubMed, Medline and Embase. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Eighteen studies were enrolled for analyses. Pooled overall analyses showed that rs1501299 polymorphism was significantly associated with PCOS risk (recessive model: p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02, OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.77, 95%CI 0.62-0.95; allele model: p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001, OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.15, 95%CI 1.06-1.26). Further subgroup analyses according to ethnicity of participants revealed that rs1501299 and rs2241766 polymorphisms were both significantly correlated with PCOS risk in Caucasians. In addition, rs1501299 polymorphism was also significantly correlated with PCOS risk in East Asians. Our findings indicated that rs1501299 and rs2241766 polymorphisms might serve as genetic biomarkers of PCOS in certain ethnicities.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the association of leptin, resistin, and tumour necrosis factor &#x3b1; (TNF-&#x3b1;) with prognosis in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Analysis included 284 T2D patients. Apart from routine laboratory parameters, baseline leptin, resistin, and TNF-&#x3b1; concentrations were measured. Patients were followed for a median of 5.4&#xa0;years. The primary endpoint was all-cause death at follow-up. The secondary endpoint was a composite of death, acute coronary syndrome, and stroke or transient ischemic attack. At baseline, median age was 68&#xa0;years, and 48% of patients were female. Data on the primary endpoint were obtained for all patients: 32 (11%) died during follow-up. Data on the secondary endpoint were available for 230 patients, of whom 45 (20%) reached the secondary endpoint. In univariate analyses, older age, heart failure, lower-glomerular filtration rate, and higher resistin, TNF-&#x3b1; and NT-proBNP concentrations were predictors of the study endpoints. Of these variables, only resistin remained an independent predictor of both study endpoints in multivariate models. In receiver-operating characteristic analysis, area under the curve for resistin was 0.7. Resistin concentration of greater than or equal to 11.4&#xa0;ng/mL had sensitivity of 41% and specificity of 91% for prediction of death at follow-up (Youden's index). Higher resistin is associated with reduced survival in T2D, irrespectively of TNF-&#x3b1;. Resistin concentration of above 11&#xa0;ng/mL indicates T2D patients at an increased risk of unfavourable outcomes. Leptin was not a prognostic factor. These results suggest that in T2D, association of resistin with unfavourable outcomes might, at least in part, result from its pro-inflammatory properties.",

We searched the following databases until July 2018: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Data were pooled using the inverse variance method and expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Out of 831 reports, 36 RCTs were eligible for including to our meta-analysis.

    "abstract": "In obesity, metabolic and voluntary factors regulate appetite, and a dysregulation of the reward pathway was demonstrated in all addiction disorders. Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) is already used to modulate cerebral dopamine activation in neuro-psychiatric diseases. We presently assess the acute effect of high frequency (HF) and low frequency (LF) dTMS on the modulation of the main neuropeptides and neurotransmitters involved in the reward pathway in obese subjects. This study was designed as a double-blind, sham-controlled, randomized clinical trial. Thirty-three obese patients (9 males, 24 females, age 48.1&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;10.6, BMI 36.4&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.7) were enrolled in the study. All patients were studied during a single dTMS session and blood aliquots were drawn before and after a single dTMS session. Metabolic and neuro-endocrine parameters were evaluated before and after: (1) 18&#x2009;Hz dTMS (HF, 13 patients); (2) 1&#x2009;Hz dTMS (LF, 10 patients); (3) Sham treatment (Sham, 10 patients). No statistically significant variations in metabolic parameters, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate were shown acutely. HF showed a significant increase of &#x3b2;-endorphin compared to other groups (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.048); a significant increase of ghrelin in LF (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.041) was also demonstrated. A single session of HF dTMS treatment determines in obese subjects an acute increase of &#x3b2;-endorphin level, indicating an activation of the reward pathway. The present findings constitute proof of principle for a potential application of this methodology in obesity treatment.",

Ninety-one studies were included in the present review, with a total number of 11,074 pregnant women. A meta-analysis was not conducted due to the high inter-study heterogeneity. Current evidence suggests that fatty acid-binding protein-4 levels are significantly increased in pregnancies complicated with gestational diabetes, while no association of serum apelin and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 with the disease can be supported. Data regarding the rest adipokines are conflicting, since the available studies did not unanimously indicate a significant change of their levels in gestational diabetes. The findings of the present systematic review suggest the promising role of fatty acid-binding protein-4 in the prediction of gestational diabetes, while inconsistent evidence exists regarding the rest novel adipokines. Future cohorts are needed to assess their predictive efficacy and fully elucidate their contribution in the disease.",

    "abstract": "Chronic inflammation is a process sustained by the augmentation of circulating cytokines level and C-reactive protein (CRP). Adipocytes and adipose tissue infiltration with inflammatory cells, are an important source of adipokines production, and their expansion due to overnutrition is responsible for increased in inflammation. The reduction of body fat following both controlled diets or gastric surgery can be favorable in the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. A systematic literature search performed using PubMed, Google Scholar and Cochrane Library database screened for clinical and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using the combination of the following keywords: weight loss, inflammation, restricted diet, anti-inflammatory effect. Studies including diet intervention, weight loss after gastric surgery have been included. Multidisciplinary program with the addition of food supplements, exercise, or drugs have been excluded to avoid their interference with the regulation inflammatory markers. Out of 967 articles found, 76 were selected, including a total of 6742 patients with a mean age of 44.0&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;3,3 years and a BMI of 33&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;6.6. The observation period ranged from 3 weeks up to two years with an average weight loss per month of 1.1&#xa0;kg. In most of the studies, it was found that weight loss caused a significant reduction of plasma level of inflammatory cytokines although three studies did not see any effect. In obese and overweight subjects weight loss, induced both by energy-restricted diet or surgery, is a determinant factor for reducing the level of pro-inflammatory markers. Hypocaloric diet has an anti-inflammatory effect independent of the diet composition which can play an important role in the prevention of chronic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Individuals of African ethnicity are disproportionately burdened with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, despite the genetic link, genetic association studies of CKD in African populations are lacking. We conducted a systematic review to critically evaluate the existing studies on CKD genetic risk inferred by polymorphism(s) amongst African populations in Africa. The study followed the HuGE handbook and PRISMA protocol. We included studies reporting on the association of polymorphism(s) with prevalent CKD, end-stage renaldisease (ESRD) or CKD-associated traits. Given the very few studies investigating the effects of the same single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on CKD risk, a narrative synthesis of the evidence was conducted. A total of 30 polymorphisms in 11 genes were investigated for their association with CKD, ESRD or related traits, all using the candidate-gene approach. Of all the included genes, MYH9, AT1R and MTHFR genes failed to predict CKD or related traits, while variants in the APOL1, apoE, eNOS, XPD, XRCC1, renalase, ADIPOQ, and CCR2 genes were associated with CKD or other related traits. Two SNPs (rs73885319, rs60910145) and haplotypes (G-A-G; G1; G2) of the apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene were studied in more than one population group, with similar association with prevalent CKD observed. The remaining polymorphisms were investigated in single studies. According to this systematic review, there is currently insufficient evidence of the specific polymorphisms that poses African populations at an increased risk of CKD. Large-scale genetic studies are warranted to better understand susceptibility polymorphisms, specific to African populations.",

    "abstract": "It is unknown whether a school-based prevention program has the potential to improve microvascular health in children. This study investigates the impact of the school-based lifestyle intervention program JuvenTUM 3 on physical activity, physical fitness, serum biomarkers and microvascular function. We studied 434 children (10-11 years) in a cluster-randomized setting (8 intervention schools, IG; 7 control schools, CG) over 18 months. The school-based prevention program included weekly lifestyle lessons for children with the aim to increase physical activity in and outside of school, physical fitness as well as health behavior. Anthropometric measurements and blood sampling were conducted using standard protocols, physical activity by use of a questionnaire and physical fitness by a 6-item-test battery. Central retinal arteriolar (CRAE) and venular (CRVE) vessel diameters as early marker of vascular dysfunction, as well as the arteriolar-to-venular diameter ratio (AVR), were investigated with a non-mydriatic vessel analyser. School-based physical activity increased in 41% of children in IG (19% in CG, p = 0.038). Improvements in vascular parameters were observed for AVR (increase in 83% of children in IG versus 50% in CG; p &lt; 0.001) and for CRVE (43% of children with retinal venular widening in IG versus 58% in CG, p = 0.019). These vascular improvements were also seen in overweight children for CRAE (p = 0.021) and AVR (p &lt; 0.001). The school-based prevention program JuvenTUM 3 increased physical activity at school inducing favourable effects on retinal microvasculature function. These findings underline the importance of early lifestyle interventions in children for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.",

    "abstract": "Background Meteorin-like hormone (Metrnl) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) are protein molecules that stimulate the production of brown adipose tissue to improve diseases such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. The aim of this study was to investigate the response of Metrnl protein and IL-4 in overweight women during exercise in temperate, warm and cold water. Materials and methods Thirteen overweight young women (mean age 25.21 &#xb1; 3.27 years, body mass index 26.43 &#xb1; 1.34 kg/m2) were selected randomly and performed three sessions of interval exercise (40 min per session, 65% of maximum oxygen consumption) in non-consecutive days in temperate (24-25 &#xb0;C), warm (36.5-37.5 &#xb0;C) and cold (16.5-17.5 &#xb0;C) water. Blood sampling was done immediately before and after exercise. Results The Metrnl level significantly increased after exercise in temperate and warm water (p = 0.0001) and significantly decreased in cold water (p = 0.0001). IL-4 level significantly increased after exercise in warm water (p = 0.003), while there was no significant change after exercise in temperate and cold water. Conclusions Exercise in warm water appears to stimulate and accumulate immune cells compared to temperate and cold water. This feature can be used to stimulate the production of hormones such as Metrnl and IL-4 to enhance brown fat, although more studies are needed in this regard.",

    "title": "Carnosine Supplementation Improves Serum Resistin Concentrations in Overweight or Obese Otherwise Healthy Adults: A Pilot Randomized Trial.",
    "abstract": "Adipokines play an important role in the regulation of glucose metabolism. We have previously shown that carnosine supplementation in overweight or obese non-diabetic individuals improves glucose metabolism but does not change adiponectin concentrations. However, its effect on other adipokines has not been investigated. Herein we further determined the effect of carnosine supplementation on serum adipsin, resistin and leptin. Twenty-two overweight or obese otherwise healthy adults were randomly assigned to receive either 2 g of carnosine (n = 13) or identically looking placebo (n = 9) for 12 weeks. Serum adipsin, leptin and resistin were analyzed using a bead-based multiplex assay. Carnosine supplementation decreased serum resistin concentrations compared to placebo (mean change from baseline: -35 &#xb1; 83 carnosine vs. 35 &#xb1; 55 ng/mL placebo, p = 0.04). There was a trend for a reduction in serum leptin concentrations after carnosine supplementation (-76 &#xb1; 165 ng/mL carnosine vs. 20 &#xb1; 28 ng/mL placebo, p = 0.06). The changes in leptin and resistin concentrations were inversely related to the change in concentration for urinary carnosine (r = -0.72, p = 0.0002; r = -0.67, p = 0.0009, respectively), carnosine-propanal (r = -0.56, p = 0.005; r = -0.63, p = 0.001, respectively) and carnosine-propanol (r = -0.61, p = 0.002; r = -0.60, p = 0.002, respectively). There were no differences between groups in change in adipsin concentrations. Our findings show carnosine supplementation may normalize some, but not all, of the serum adipokine concentrations involved in glucose metabolism, in overweight and obese individuals. Further clinical trials with larger samples are needed to confirm these results.",

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent degenerative joint disease, which is associated with chronic and disabling pain. The adipocytokines, resistin and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#x3b1;), might play a role in OA pathogenesis and outcomes. The aim of this study was, therefore, to assess the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of a garlic supplement on serum resistin and TNF-&#x3b1; concentrations and on pain severity in overweight or obese women with knee OA. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-design trial. In this study, 80 post-menopausal overweight or obese women (25&#x202f;&#x2264;&#x202f;BMI&#x202f;&#x2264;&#x202f;40&#x202f;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, age 50-75 years) with mild to moderate knee OA were enrolled. Patients were randomly divided into two groups to receive twice-daily either garlic tablets (total: 1000&#x202f;mg) or placebo for 12&#xa0;weeks. The primary outcome measures were fasting serum concentrations of resistin and TNF-&#x3b1;, and pain severity (assessed using 0-10 point visual analogue scale (VAS)). At week 12, resistin concentrations were significantly decreased in the garlic group (6.41&#x202f;&#xb1;&#x202f;2.40 to 5.56&#x202f;&#xb1;&#x202f;2.16&#x202f;ng/ml; P&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.008). Serum TNF-&#x3b1; levels did not change significantly within or between the two groups. Pain scores were significantly reduced in the garlic (6.8&#x202f;&#xb1;&#x202f;2 to 5.3&#x202f;&#xb1;&#x202f;2.3; P&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.002), but not in the placebo (6.7&#x202f;&#xb1;&#x202f;2.4 to 6.2&#x202f;&#xb1;&#x202f;2.5; P&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.674), group. Pain scores were also significantly lower in the garlic, compared with the placebo, group following supplementation (5.3&#x202f;&#xb1;&#x202f;2.3&#x202f;vs. 6.2&#x202f;&#xb1;&#x202f;2.5; P&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.043). The findings suggest that garlic supplementation for 12 weeks might reduce pain severity in overweight or obese women with knee OA, which may, at least in part, be mediated via a reduction in the pro-inflammatory adipocytokine, resistin.",

    "title": "Leptin: role over central nervous system in epilepsy.",
    "abstract": "Adipose tissue is a dynamic organ with different effects on the body. Many of these effects are mediated by leptin, a hormone strongly involved in regulation of feeding and energy metabolism. It has an important role as a mediator of neuronal excitatory activity and higher brain functions. The aim of this study was to review the association between leptin and cerebral neuronal function, in particular its anticonvulsant or convulsant effects and the possible therapeutic role for treating epilepsy. For this purpose, the databases Pubmed, Science Direct, Elsevier, ResearchGate and Scielo were searched to identify experimental studies, reviews and systematic review articles, published in English, Spanish or Portuguese. Experimental studies and the presence of leptin receptors in nervous system sites other than the hypothalamus suggest an influence on higher brain functions. Indeed several animal studies have demonstrated a role of these channels in epileptiform activity as both anticonvulsive and convulsive effects have been found. The reason for these discrepancies is unclear but provides clear evidence of a potential role of leptin and leptin therapy in epileptiform activity. The association between leptin and brain function demonstrates the importance of peripheral metabolic hormones on central nervous system and opens a new way for the development of novel therapeutic interventions in diseases like epilepsy. Nevertheless further investigations are important to clarify the dynamics and diverse actions of leptin on excitatory regulation in the brain.",

A systematic search in PubMed, Embase, ISI Web of Science, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure databases were conducted up to October 1, 2017. The standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval was applied to pool the effect size. Finally, 31 eligible studies were included in this meta-analysis. The overall results indicated that serum adiponectin levels in BC cases were significantly lower than the controls (SMD&#x200a;=&#x200a;-0.33, P&#x200a;&lt;&#x200a;0.0001). As for the subgroup analysis of menstrual status, serum adiponectin levels were significantly lower in pre- and postmenopausal BC cases. Moreover, the subgroup analysis by ethnicity in pre- and postmenopausal group indicated an inverse association between adiponectin levels and BC risk in Asian population, but not in Caucasian population. The present meta-analysis suggests that low serum adiponectin concentration may be associated with an increased BC risk in premenopausal and postmenopausal women, especially among Asians. Adiponectin may serve as a biomarker of BC risk and help to identify subjects at high risk for BC development.",

We searched PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, Web of Science, and EMBASE until December 2016 for observational studies assessing each of the anthropometric measurements, food-related traits, and leptin of 1359 G/A polymorphism of CNR1 gene. A total of 22 studies were included in the meta-analysis comparing mean and SD differences of the anthropometric measurements, leptin, and dietary intake between GA/AA and GG genotypes. The results showed that subjects with GA/AA genotype had significantly lower BMI (weighted mean difference = -0.59 kg/m2, p &lt; 0.001) compared to those with the GG genotype. Dietary intake of fat, carbohydrate, and protein as well as serum levels of leptin was not significantly different between GA/AA and GG genotypes. It was revealed that subjects with mutant polymorphism (GA/AA) of CNR1, compared to the wild-type group (GG), had lower BMI (although there was unexplained heterogeneity).",

Resistin is one of the possible candidates for these pathologies but there are not enough data to prove if resistin has positive, neutral, or negative effects on one or some components of MetS. This review summarizes data about comparing the effects and contribution of resistin in initiation and progression of MetS components and also its different actions between human and other mammalians. This summarized data about the relationship of resistin and MetS components have been obtained from clinical researches and in some cases even animal studies. To find the relevant studies, the search in PubMed, Science Direct, and Scopus were performed. Human and animal studies on relationships between resistin and MetS (initiation and progression of components) were included in our search. In experiments reported among different human genetic groups as well as the patients with various disease such as diabetes, no significant correlation is shown between FBG and resistin level. Furthermore, this review shows that the results of correlation between resistin and TG, HDL, and central or abdominal obesity were inconsistent. These inconsistencies can arise from different sample size or genetic groups, gender, and also from experimental studies. Therefore, to obtain precise results systematic review and meta-analyses are required.",

This meta-analysis was performed to investigate the association of leptin with mortality. The PubMed, Scopus, Google scholar, and reference lists of the included studies were searched for all published prospective observational studies that described the associations of serum leptin and mortality up to August 2017. Two reviewers independently assessed all potentially relevant studies for inclusion and methodological quality using standardized abstraction forms. Of 518 studies identified, 19 studies considered the association of leptin with all-cause mortality (16 208 subjects) and 12 studies evaluated the association of leptin with disease-specific mortality (13 680 subjects). In the overall analysis, no significant association was found between leptin and all-cause mortality (HR=1.028; 95% CI: 0.908-1.165; p=0.659), with a high between study heterogeneity (p&#x2c2;0.001, I<sup>2</sup>=61).

    "abstract": "Physical activity, particularly exercise training, is an evidence-based approach for managing symptoms, restoring function and improving overall wellness in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Several recent studies have argued for a potential disease modifying effect of exercise in people with MS, and among the potential mediating mechanisms are exercise training effects on both cytokines and adipokines. The objectives of this study were to perform a systematic review of exercise training effects on cytokine and adipokine profiles in persons with MS. We conducted open-dated searches of PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and PEDro using the terms 'Multiple sclerosis' or 'MS' AND 'exercise' OR 'training' OR 'physical activity' AND 'cytokine' OR 'inflammatory' OR 'immune' OR 'adipokine'. Included studies were written in English; comprised of humans with MS, and evaluated the effects of regular physical activity or exercise on pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory cytokines or adipokines. Two authors independently scanned titles and abstracts, and read the studies included. All studies were rated on the PEDro scale and further classified based on American Academy of Neurology criteria. Twelve studies were included of which 10 studies focused on cytokines, 1 study focused on adipokines, and 1 study included both cytokines and adipokines. The selected studies included 3 Class I studies, 7 Class II studies, and 2 Class IV studies and had average PEDro scores of 6.9&#x202f;&#xb1;&#x202f;1.6. Studies included endurance (n&#x202f;=&#x202f;5), resistance (n&#x202f;=&#x202f;3), combined (n&#x202f;=&#x202f;3), and vibration (n&#x202f;=&#x202f;1) training. Overall, there is a general lack of standardization of procedures across studies and inconsistent evidence for the effects of physical activity and exercise on cytokine and adipokine profiles in MS, with a general pattern indicating a lack of effect. Research regarding the effects of exercise training on cytokines and adipokines in MS is in its infancy, but exercise represents an adjuvant therapy in MS, and future studies are essential for clarifying the role of exercise on cytokines and adipokines in MS.",

The serum leptin level in male RCC was significantly lower than that of in female RCC in overall populations, Asians, and Caucasians while no marked difference was noted between genders in the plasma samples. Plasma leptin level in Stage I-II RCC was significantly higher than that in the Stage III-IV. In addition, no significant difference was observed between following parameters, including RCC and non-RCC, clear and non-clear RCC, Grade I-II and Grade III-IV RCC, M0 and M1 RCC, N0 and N1 RCC, and size &lt;4 cm and size &gt;4 cm RCC. No evidence of publication bias was observed. Our findings indicated that serum leptin level was lower in men with RCC than in women with RCC. Leptin level may not be related to the risk and progression of RCC. However, more studies should be performed in the future.",

    "abstract": "Subjects maintaining a &#x2265;10% dietary weight loss exhibit decreased circulating concentrations of bioactive thyroid hormones and increased skeletal muscle work efficiency largely due to increased expression of more-efficient myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms (MHC I) and significantly mediated by the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin. The primary purpose of this study was to examine the effects of triiodothyronine (T3) repletion on energy homeostasis and skeletal muscle physiology in weight-reduced subjects and to compare these results with the effects of leptin repletion. Nine healthy in-patients with obesity were studied at usual weight (Wtinitial) and following a 10% dietary weight loss while receiving 5 wk of a placebo (Wt-10%placebo) or T3 (Wt-10%T3) in a single-blind crossover design. Primary outcome variables were skeletal muscle work efficiency and vastus lateralis muscle mRNA expression. These results were compared with the effects of leptin repletion in a population of 22 subjects, some of whom participated in a previous study. At Wt-10%placebo, skeletal muscle work efficiency and relative expression of the more-efficient/less-efficient MHC I/MHC II isoforms were significantly increased and the ratio of the less-efficient to the more-efficient sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase isoforms (SERCA1/SERCA2) was significantly decreased. These changes were largely reversed by T3 repletion to a degree similar to the changes that occurred with leptin repletion. These data support the hypothesis that the effects of leptin on energy expenditure in weight-reduced individuals are largely mediated by T3 and suggest that further study of the possible role of thyroid hormone repletion as adjunctive therapy to help sustain weight loss is needed.",

    "title": "Adiponectin, Free Fatty Acids, and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes and Acute Coronary Syndrome.",
    "abstract": "In observational cohorts, adiponectin is inversely associated and free fatty acids (FFAs) are directly associated with incident coronary heart disease (CHD). Adiponectin tends to be reduced and FFAs elevated in type 2 diabetes. We investigated relationships of adiponectin and FFA and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) and death in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and type 2 diabetes using data from the AleCardio (Effect of Aleglitazar on Cardiovascular Outcomes After Acute Coronary Syndrome in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus) trial, which compared the PPAR-&#x3b1;/&#x3b3; agonist aleglitazar with placebo. Using Cox regression adjusted for demographic, laboratory, and treatment variables, we determined associations of baseline adiponectin and FFAs, or the change in adiponectin and FFAs from baseline, with MACEs (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) and death. A twofold higher baseline adiponectin (n = 6,998) was directly associated with risk of MACEs (hazard ratio [HR] 1.17 [95% CI 1.08-1.27]) and death (HR 1.53 [95% CI 1.35-1.73]). A doubling of adiponectin from baseline to month 3 (n = 6,325) was also associated with risk of death (HR 1.20 [95% CI 1.03-1.41]). Baseline FFAs (n = 7,038), but not change in FFAs from baseline (n = 6,365), were directly associated with greater risk of MACEs and death. There were no interactions with study treatment. In contrast to prior observational data for incident CHD, adiponectin is prospectively associated with MACEs and death in patients with type 2 diabetes and ACS, and an increase in adiponectin from baseline is directly related to death. These findings raise the possibility that adiponectin has different effects in patients with type 2 diabetes and ACS than in populations without prevalent cardiovascular disease. Consistent with prior data, FFAs are directly associated with adverse outcomes.",

    "title": "Cardiometabolic Risk Factors at 5 Years After Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation in Infancy.",
    "abstract": "Omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 LCPUFA) supplementation during infancy may reduce adult cardiovascular risk as observed in animals. We assessed the effect of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation in infancy on growth, body composition, and cardiometabolic risk factors at 5 years of age. Infants were randomly assigned to a daily supplement of n-3 LCPUFA or olive oil (control) from birth to 6 months (n = 420). Measurements included weight, length, cord blood adipokines at birth and anthropometry, skinfolds, blood pressure, heart rate, fasting blood adipokines, and biochemistry at 5 years. The infants who received n-3 LCPUFA had a smaller waist circumference at 5 years (coefficient: 1.1 cm; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.01 to 2.14), which remained significant after adjustments for confounders (coefficient: 0.8 cm; 95% CI: 0.19 to 1.30). Five-year-old boys who received n-3 LCPUFA supplementation as infants had a 21% reduction in insulin concentrations (ratio: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.66 to 0.94) and a 22% reduction in insulin resistance (ratio: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.64 to 0.95) compared with the control group. There were no other differences in growth and cardiometabolic risk factors between the groups for the whole cohort at birth, 2.5, or 5 years. Supplementation with n-3 LCPUFA in infancy revealed a reduction in waist circumference at 5 years. Boys in the n-3 LCPUFA group showed reduced insulin concentrations and insulin resistance at 5 years, which may have beneficial outcomes for later health. No effects were seen in girls. Longer term follow-up of the cohort is warranted to determine whether these differences are maintained into adolescence.",

    "title": "Leptin and adiponectin levels in major depressive disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "To explore differences in adipokine levels (i.e., leptin and adiponectin levels) between adults with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and healthy controls (HC), and to discuss the possible role of adipokine regulation in the development and progression of MDD. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A systematic search was conducted for all English and Chinese peer-reviewed articles from inception to November 2017. A random effects model was used to calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD) of leptin and/or adiponectin levels in subjects diagnosed with MDD versus HC within a 95% confidence interval (CI). Thirty-three studies were included in this meta-analysis. In total, 4,372 (52.3%) subjects with MDD and 3,984 (47.7%) HC were compared. We identified significant lower adiponectin levels in MDD compared to HC with a small effect size (ES) (SMD&#x202f;=&#x202f;-0.25; 95% CI: -0.48, -0.02; P&#x202f;&lt;&#x202f;0.001). However, no significant difference was observed in leptin levels between MDD subjects and HC (SMD&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.13; 95% CI: -0.06, 0.31; P&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.170). The heterogeneity in the results of our meta-analysis could not be completely explained by dividing subjects into subgroups. Results from subgroup analyses suggested that studies involving samples with BMI&#x202f;&#x2265;&#x202f;25 had lower adiponectin levels in subjects with MDD compared to HC, and older age samples (i.e., age&#x202f;&#x2265;&#x202f;40) with BMI&#x202f;&#x2265;&#x202f;25 had both higher leptin levels and lower adiponectin levels in MDD subjects as compared to HC. The heterogeneity of included studies, small sample sizes, and potential publication bias were significant limitations. The current systematic review and meta-analysis indicated that lower adiponectin levels may be associated with MDD. Moreover, the results suggest that males expressing lower adiponectin and leptin levels have an increased likelihood of developing MDD. Future studies should aim to investigate the manifestation of depressive phenotypes in older, obese populations with altered metabolic profiles resulting from adipokine dysregulation. The review has been registered with PROSPERO (registration number CRD42018082733).",

    "abstract": "Exercise training is recommended for improving health and protecting against the development of metabolic and cardiovascular pathologies. Combined resistance and aerobic exercise training (CRAE) has been shown to provide unique benefits in older adults with cardiovascular diseases. We sought to determine the beneficial effects of CRAE in adolescent girls who are obese and hyperinsulinemic. Forty adolescent girls who are obese (age 14.7&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1 years; BMI 30&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2) were randomly assigned to a no exercise (CON n&#x2009;=&#x2009;20) or combined exercise group (EX n&#x2009;=&#x2009;20). The EX group performed resistance and aerobic exercise for 12 weeks, 5 times per week. Exercise intensity was increased gradually, from 40 to 70% of heart rate reserve (HRR), every 4 weeks. The brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (BaPWV), blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), blood leptin, adiponectin levels, and body composition were measured before and after the 12-week intervention. We observed that CRAE effectively reduced the body fat percentage, body weight, and waist circumference in the EX group (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). After 12 weeks of training, subjects in the CRAE group maintained appropriate leptin and adiponectin levels and showed positive improvements of blood insulin, glucose, and insulin resistance parameters relative to baseline and to the CON group (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). CRAE is a useful therapeutic method to alleviate metabolic risk factors in adolescent girls who are obese and hyperinsulinemic.",

    "abstract": "Inconsistencies have existed in research findings on the association between cardiovascular disease (CVD) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ADIPOQ, triggering this up-to-date meta-analysis. We searched for relevant studies in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CNKI, CBM, VIP, and WanFang databases up to 1st July 2017. We included 19,106 cases and 31,629 controls from 65 published articles in this meta-analysis. STATA 12.0 software was used for all statistical analyses. Our results showed that rs266729 polymorphism was associated with the increased risk of CVD in dominant model or in heterozygote model; rs2241766 polymorphism was associated with the increased risk of CVD in the genetic models (allelic, dominant, recessive, heterozygote, and homozygote). In subgroup analysis, significant associations were found in different subgroups with the three SNPs. Meta-regression and subgroup analysis showed that heterogeneity might be explained by other confounding factors. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the results of our meta-analysis were stable and robust. In addition, the results of trial sequential analysis showed that evidences of our results are sufficient to reach concrete conclusions. In conclusion, our meta-analysis found significant increased CVD risk is associated with rs266729 and rs2241766, but not associated with rs1501299.",

    "title": "[Effect of aerobic exercise and resistance exercise in improving non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a randomized controlled trial].",
    "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the effect of dietary control combined with different exercise modes on plasma vaspin, irisin, and metabolic parameters in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) through a randomized open parallel-controlled study. Methods: The patients aged 30-65 years who visited Tianjin Third Central Hospital from January 2013 to December 2014 and were diagnosed with NAFLD by liver ultrasound and fat content determination were screening, and 474 patients were enrolled in this randomized controlled trial and divided into aerobic exercise group, resistance exercise group, and control group. All patients received dietary intervention. The three groups were compared in terms of biochemical parameters, fat content, NFS score, energy metabolic parameters, body composition index, and levels of vaspin and irisin at baseline and after 6 months of intervention. SPSS 19.0 was used for statistical analysis. The t-test, the Mann-Whitney U test, the chi-square test, and an analysis of variance were used for comparison between groups. The multiple imputation method was used for missing data, and the results were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Results: There were no significant differences in age, sex, anthropometrical parameters, and biochemical parameters between the three groups at baseline. Compared with dietary control alone, aerobic exercise and resistance exercise helped to achieve significant reductions in waist circumference, diastolic pressure, percentage of body fat, volatile fatty acid, fasting blood glucose, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, free fatty acid, uric acid, alanine aminotransferase, and liver fat content after 6 months of intervention (P &lt; 0.05). The aerobic exercise group had a significant increase in non-protein respiratory quotient and significant reductions in body mass index and aspartate aminotransferase after intervention, as well as a significant increase in resting energy expenditure and significant reductions in abdominal fat ratio and total cholesterol after 6 months of resistance exercise (P &lt; 0.05). The aerobic exercise group and the resistance exercise group had a significant reduction in vaspin and a significant increase in irisin after intervention (P &lt; 0.05), and the resistance exercise group had significantly greater changes in these two adipokines than the aerobic exercise group (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Exercise therapy is an effective method for the treatment of metabolism-associated diseases, and a combination of resistance and aerobic exercises is more reasonable and effective in clinical practice. As a relatively safe exercise mode, resistance exercise can also effectively improve the metabolic state of NAFLD patients. &#x76ee;&#x7684;&#xff1a; &#x901a;&#x8fc7;&#x968f;&#x673a;&#x5f00;&#x653e;&#x5e73;&#x884c;&#x5bf9;&#x7167;&#x7814;&#x7a76;&#xff0c;&#x63a2;&#x8ba8;&#x996e;&#x98df;&#x63a7;&#x5236;&#x8054;&#x5408;&#x4e0d;&#x540c;&#x8fd0;&#x52a8;&#x65b9;&#x5f0f;&#x5e72;&#x9884;&#x5bf9;&#x975e;&#x9152;&#x7cbe;&#x6027;&#x8102;&#x80aa;&#x809d;&#xff08;NAFLD&#xff09;&#x60a3;&#x8005;&#x8840;&#x6d46;&#x5185;&#x810f;&#x8102;&#x80aa;&#x7ec4;&#x7ec7;&#x6765;&#x6e90;&#x7684;&#x4e1d;&#x6c28;&#x9178;&#x86cb;&#x767d;&#x9176;&#x6291;&#x5236;&#x5242;&#xff08;Vaspin&#xff09;&#x3001;&#x9e22;&#x5c3e;&#x7d20;&#xff08;Irisin&#xff09;&#x53ca;&#x4ee3;&#x8c22;&#x6307;&#x6807;&#x7684;&#x5f71;&#x54cd;&#x3002;

    "title": "Is leptin resistance the cause or the consequence of diet-induced obesity?",
    "abstract": "Obesity is strongly associated with leptin resistance. It is unclear whether leptin resistance results from the (over)consumption of energy-dense diets or if reduced leptin sensitivity is also a pre-existing factor in rodent models of diet-induced obesity (DIO). We here tested whether leptin sensitivity on a chow diet predicts subsequent weight gain and leptin sensitivity on a free choice high-fat high-sucrose (fcHFHS) diet. Based upon individual leptin sensitivity on chow diet, rats were grouped in leptin sensitive (LS, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;22) and leptin resistant (LR, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;19) rats (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.000), and the development of DIO on a fcHFHS diet was compared. The time-course of leptin sensitivity was measured over weeks in individual rats. Both on a chow and a fcHFHS diet, high variability in leptin sensitivity was observed between rats, but not over time per individual rat. Exposure to the fcHFHS diet revealed that LR rats were more prone to develop DIO (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.013), which was independent of caloric intake (p&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;0.320) and the development of diet-induced leptin resistance (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.769). Reduced leptin sensitivity in LR compared with LS rats before fcHFHS diet exposure, was associated with reduced leptin-induced phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3) levels in the dorsomedial and ventromedial hypothalamus (P&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.049), but not the arcuate nucleus (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.558). A pre-existing reduction in leptin sensitivity determines the susceptibility to develop excessive DIO after fcHFHS diet exposure. Rats with a pre-existing reduction in leptin sensitivity develop excessive DIO without eating more calories or altering their leptin sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "n-3PUFA consumption has been widely accepted as a nutritional strategy for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), but little is known about the dose-response relationship between dietary n-3PUFA and serum biomarkers associated with cardiovascular health in the general population. The present study involved a 12-week double-blind, randomized controlled trial to explore the effects of fish oil with different doses (0.31, 0.62 and 1.24 g d-1 of EPA and DHA) on serum fatty acids and cardio-metabolic biomarkers including adiponectin, inflammatory markers, lipid profiles and fasting glucose in healthy middle-aged and elderly Chinese people. 240 volunteers met our inclusion criteria. A total of 39 subjects dropped out and 201 finally completed the intervention. No significant differences in baseline characteristics and daily intakes of dietary nutrients were detected among all groups. After a 12-week intervention, fish oil dose-dependently enhanced serum EPA, DHA, n-3PUFA and adiponectin (except for 0.31 g d-1), but decreased serum n-6/n-3PUFA, TG and fasting glucose. Changes in the above indicators from the baseline to week 12 in fish oil groups significantly differed from those in the control. Meanwhile, all the doses of EPA and DHA led to decreases in serum CRP; only 1.24 g d-1 led to an increase in HDL-C with a concurrent decrease in TC/HDL-C even though these changes were not significantly different among all groups. All the findings suggested that fish oil dose-dependently regulated serum PUFA and cardio-metabolic biomarkers including adiponectin, CRP, lipid profiles and fasting glucose in healthy middle-aged and elderly Chinese people who consumed insufficient dietary n-3PUFA, and the most desirable changes were observed for 1.24 g d-1.",

    "abstract": "New findings on adipose tissue physiology and obesity-associated inflammation status suggest that modification of the adipokine level can be relevant for the long-term prevention of obesity-associated chronic disease. The scope of the present study was to investigate the effectiveness of physical exercise in reducing the systemic inflammation related to obesity in children. We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis of controlled randomized trials, identified through electronic database search, which investigated the effect of physical exercise, without concomitant dietary intervention, on adiponectin, leptin, and/or other inflammatory markers in children up to age 18 years with a body mass index greater than the 95th percentile for age and sex. Seven trials were included in the meta-analysis, with a total of 250 participants. Compared with the control group without any lifestyle modification, the physical exercise resulted in a reduction in leptin [standardized mean difference (SMD) -1.13; 95% confidence interval (95%CI): -1.89 to -0.37; I<sup>2</sup>&#x2009;=&#x2009;79.9%] and interleukin-6 (SMD -0.84; 95%CI: -1.45 to -0.23, I<sup>2</sup>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.9%) and an increase in adiponectin plasma concentration (SMD 0.69; 95%CI: 0.02-1.35; I<sup>2</sup>&#x2009;=&#x2009;74.3%). These results indicate that physical exercise improved the inflammatory state in children with obesity. It is unclear whether this effect can reduce the risk of cardiovascular and metabolic disease in adulthood. Clinical trials with a uniform intervention protocol and outcome measurements are required to put our knowledge on adipose tissue biology into a clinical perspective.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the mechanism of exogenous adiponectin in the prevention of no-reflow phenomenon in type 2 diabetic (T2DM) patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) treatment. 66 patients were randomly divided into control group and observation group, 33 cases in each group. According to the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) emergency treatment principle, patients from the control group were treated with an intracoronary injection of adenosine combined with a micro-pump intravenous infusion of tirofiban. Patients from the observation group were injected with exogenous adiponectin in addition to the adenosine and tirofiban treatments. There were no significant differences in gender, age, location of the target lesion, degree of stenosis, stent implantation number, length and the inner diameter between control and observation group (p &gt; 0.05). Lower frequent of slow blood flow and no-reflow and shorter interventional procedures were observed in observation group compared with those of control group (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the increase of plasma creatine kinase (CK-MB) in patients of observation group was lower than that of the patients in control group (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, the levels of troponin-I (cTnI), IL-6, TNF- &#x3b1;, endothelin-1 (ET-1), vascular endothelial adhesion molecular I (VCAM-1) and bax/Bcl-2 were significantly lower in observation group than those in control (p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) during a 12-month follow-up was significantly lower in the observation group than that of control (p &lt; 0.05). Exogenous adiponectin further reduced the no-reflow phenomenon during PCI treatment of the patients with T2DM combined with AMI. The function of exogenous adiponectin is associated with the reduced myocardial and endothelial cell injury and the inhibited inflammation and apoptosis. The application of exogenous adiponectin can significantly improve the clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "It has been reported that the uncoupling proteins (UCPs) can contribute to energy metabolism, and are thus involved in the pathogenesis of obesity. The objective of the study was to analyze the association between UCP polymorphisms, clinical parameters and leptin and adiponectin plasma levels in an adolescent population with overweight and obesity. We analyzed the UCP1 -3826 C/T, UCP2-866 G/A, Ala55Val and UCP3 -55 C/T polymorphisms and the levels of adipokines in adolescents with normal weight and with overweight or obesity. The study included 270 students aged between 12 and 18 years categorized according to the percentiles from Mexico City. Adipokines levels were measured by immunoassay methods and the UCP polymorphisms were determined using Taqman real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). No significant differences were found in the UCP polymorphisms in seven inheritance models studied. Most of the significant differences in the clinical parameters were found under a recessive model, the UCP2 -866 polymorphism was associated with diastolic blood pressure (p=0.008), triglycerides (p=0.045), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) (p=0.003), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) (p=0.050) and plasma levels of leptin (p&lt;0.001). Also, the obese group was found to have higher leptin levels and lower adiponectin levels in GA+AA vs. GG (recessive model). This study demonstrated a direct relationship between the clinical characteristics and UCP2-866 in a recessive model, associated with high levels of leptin and decreased levels of adiponectin in an obese or overweight Mexican adolescent population.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of omega-3 (food or supplement) on circulating adiponectin in patients with type 2 diabetes through a systematic review of meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials. PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were searched for relevant studies through May 2016. Two researchers screened and abstracted the literature independently. Pooled estimates were obtained using the random-effects models. Overall, omega-3 increased adiponectin by 0.57&#x2009;&#xb5;g/mL (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.15 to 1.31; p=0.01, I-square=74.2% p for heterogeneity &lt;0.001). The source of observed heterogeneity was explored by subgroup analyses. In subgroup analyses, adiponectin levels increased only in those who had consumed omega-3 for more than 8 weeks. This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials suggests that omega-3 in patients with type 2 diabetes increases circulating adiponectin. These findings support the potentially beneficial effects of dietary omega-3 in patients with type 2 diabetes on pathways related to adiponectin metabolism.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the effect of Mediterranean-type diets on cytokines and adipokines in patients with CHD. An electronic search of the literature was conducted up to October 2016 using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. Eleven of the 435 articles identified met eligibility criteria. Four observational studies reported significant inverse associations between Mediterranean-type diet scores and inflammatory cytokines. Five clinical trials (4 in non-Mediterranean countries) demonstrated nonsignificant reductions, and 2 trials conducted in Spain demonstrated significant reductions in C-reactive protein with a Mediterranean-type diet. Random effects meta-analysis of 4 controlled trials detected a nonsignificant difference in final mean value of C-reactive protein with Mediterranean-type diet vs low-fat diet. Despite promising findings from observational studies, this review demonstrated mostly nonsignificant effects of Mediterranean-type diet interventions on inflammatory cytokines and no effect in comparison to low-fat diets in controlled trials conducted primarily in Mediterranean populations. Therefore, randomized controlled trials of a traditional Mediterranean diet in non-Mediterranean populations and with multiple inflammatory biomarkers are needed in the high-risk CHD patient group.",

In both genotype groups (GG vs GA&#x202f;+&#x202f;AA), body weight, body mass index (BMI), fat mass, waist circumference and systolic blood pressure decreased after diet I and II. The decrease of these parameters was higher in non A allele carriers than A allele carriers. Pre- and post-dietary intervention, body weight, BMI, fat mass and waist circumference were higher in A allele carriers than non A allele carriers. In non A allele carriers, the decrease of glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR and Interleukin-6 levels was higher than A allele carriers after both diets. Carriers of the minor allele of rs3123554 variant of CB2R gene loose less body weight during two different hypocaloric diets.

    "title": "Systemic Inflammation in Severe Obese Patients Undergoing Surgery for Obesity and Weight-Related Diseases.",
    "abstract": "Obesity is a worldwide disease related to genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors, and it is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Recently, obesity has been characterized by a low-grade inflammatory state known as inflammome indicated by chronic increases in circulating concentrations of inflammatory markers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of weight loss induced by surgery for obesity and weight-related diseases on pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-&#x3b1;) and anti-inflammatory adipokine (adiponectin) levels, and on an adipose-derived hormone (leptin) in severely obese subjects. This randomized, controlled trial involved 55 severe obese patients (50 women, age 18-63&#xa0;years, and body mass index of 35.7-63&#xa0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) who underwent bariatric surgery (BS). Patients with a BMI &gt;&#x2009;65&#xa0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and clinical and mental instability, or significant and unrealistic expectations of surgery were excluded. Blood samples were collected during the fasting period to analyze tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x3b1;), adiponectin, and leptin levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. At baseline, no significant difference was observed in the anthropometric, demographic, clinical characteristics and biochemistry and inflammatory markers between the control group (CG) and bariatric surgery group (BSG). The same finding was also observed when we compared the baseline variables to those at the 6-month follow-up in the CG. However, the same variables in the BSG group were significantly different between baseline and the 6-month follow-up after BS. Weight loss induced by surgery for obesity and weight-related diseases reduced the inflammome state in severely obese patients.",

    "title": "Fibre supplementation for the prevention of type 2 diabetes and improvement of glucose metabolism: the randomised controlled Optimal Fibre Trial (OptiFiT).",
    "abstract": "Insoluble cereal fibres have been shown in large prospective cohort studies to be highly effective in preventing type 2 diabetes, but there is a lack of interventional data. Our 2&#xa0;year randomised double-blind prospective intervention study compared the effect of an insoluble oat fibre extract with that of placebo on glucose metabolism and incidence of diabetes. A total of 180 participants with impaired glucose tolerance underwent a modified version of the 1&#xa0;year lifestyle training programme PREvention of DIAbetes Self-management (PREDIAS) and were randomised to receive a fibre supplement (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;89; 7.5&#xa0;g of insoluble fibre per serving) or placebo (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;91; 0.8&#xa0;g of insoluble fibre per serving) twice daily for 2&#xa0;years. Eligible participants were men and women, were at least 18&#xa0;years old and did not report corticosteroid or other intensive anti-inflammatory treatment, fibre intolerance or any of the following disorders: overt diabetes, chronic or malignant disease, or severe cardiopulmonary, endocrine, psychiatric, gastrointestinal, autoimmune or eating disorder. Participants were recruited at two clinical wards in Berlin and Nuthetal. The allocation was blinded to participants and study caregivers (physicians, dietitians, study nurses). Randomisation was conducted by non-clinical staff, providing neutrally numbered supplement tins. Both supplements were similar in their visual, olfactory and gustatory appearance. Intention-to-treat analysis was applied to all individuals. After 1&#xa0;year, 2&#xa0;h OGTT levels decreased significantly in both groups but without a significant difference between the groups (fibre -0.78&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.88&#xa0;mmol/l [p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#xa0;0.001] vs placebo -0.46&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.80&#xa0;mmol/l [p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.020]; total difference 0.32&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.29&#xa0;mmol/l; not significant). The 2&#xa0;year incidence of diabetes was 9/89 (fibre group) compared with 16/91 (placebo group; difference not significant). As secondary outcomes, the change in HbA1c level was significantly different between the two groups (-0.2&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.6&#xa0;mmol/mol [-0.0&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.0%; not significant] vs +1.2&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.2&#xa0;mmol/mol [+0.1&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.0%; not significant]; total difference 1.4&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.7&#xa0;mmol/mol [0.1&#x2009;+&#x2009;0.0%]); p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.018); insulin sensitivity and hepatic insulin clearance increased in both groups. After 2&#xa0;years, improved insulin sensitivity was still present in both groups, although the effect size had diminished. Separate analysis of the sexes revealed a significantly greater reduction in 2&#xa0;h glucose levels for women in the fibre group (-0.88&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.59&#xa0;mmol/l [p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#xa0;0.001] vs -0.22&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.52&#xa0;mmol/l [p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.311]; total difference 0.67&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.31&#xa0;mmol/l; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.015). Levels of fasting glucose, adipokines and inflammatory markers remained unchanged in the two groups. Significantly increased fibre intake was restricted to the fibre group, despite dietary counselling for both groups. No severe side effects occurred. We cannot currently provide strong evidence for a beneficial effect of insoluble cereal fibre on glycaemic metabolism, although further studies may support minor effects of fibre supplementation in reducing glucose levels, insulin resistance and the incidence of type 2 diabetes. clinicaltrials.gov NCT01681173 Funding: German Diabetes Foundation (grant no. 232/11/08).",

    "title": "Effects of canagliflozin versus glimepiride on adipokines and inflammatory biomarkers in type 2 diabetes.",
    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes and obesity are pro-inflammatory states associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Canagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, demonstrated superiority in lowering HbA1c versus glimepiride with less hypoglycemia and greater weight reduction via loss of fat mass in a 52-week trial of type 2 diabetes patients. This post hoc, exploratory analysis assessed the effects of canagliflozin versus glimepiride on select adipokines, inflammatory biomarkers, and chemokines. Changes from baseline to Week 52 in serum leptin, adiponectin, IL-6, TNF&#x3b1;, CRP, PAI-1, VCAM-1, and MCP-1 were measured in a randomly selected subset of type 2 diabetes patients on metformin receiving canagliflozin 300&#x202f;mg (n&#x202f;=&#x202f;100) or glimepiride (n&#x202f;=&#x202f;100) in the overall study. Correlations between change in biomarkers and change in select metabolic and anthropometric variables were assessed. At Week 52, canagliflozin decreased median serum leptin by 25% (95% CI: -34%, -15%) and increased median serum adiponectin by 17% (95% CI: 11%, 23%) compared with glimepiride. There was a 22% reduction in median serum IL-6 (95% CI: -34%, -10%) and a 7% increase in median serum TNF&#x3b1; (95% CI: 1%, 12%) with canagliflozin versus glimepiride. No between-group differences were observed with the other biomarkers. The decrease in serum leptin with canagliflozin was correlated with change in weight (r&#x202f;&#x2265;&#x202f;0.3) only; the increase in adiponectin and decrease in IL-6 with canagliflozin occurred independently of changes in HbA1c, weight, or lipids. These results indicate that canagliflozin may improve adipose tissue function and induce changes in serum leptin, adiponectin, and IL-6 that favorably impact insulin sensitivity and cardiovascular disease risk.",

    "title": "Effects of Gender and Other Confounding Factors on Leptin Concentrations in Alzheimer's Disease: Evidence from the Combined Analysis of 27 Case-Control Studies.",
    "abstract": "Leptin, as a link between fat mass and the brain, has been reported to be associated with gender. The gender differences in leptin levels between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy elderly controls are inconclusive so far. To quantitatively summarize the leptin data available from female and male patients with AD, we searched PubMed and EMBASE for articles published from inception to July 20, 2017. Data were extracted from 27 studies, consisting of 3,014 participants. The pooled results showed that the overall leptin levels were lower in AD (Hedges' g&#x200a;=&#x200a;-0.481; p&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.002) than in controls, and the leptin levels in whole blood and serum were decreased with moderate and large effect sizes (g&#x200a;=&#x200a;-0.677, -0.839; respectively; both of p-values &lt;0.001) in AD compared with controls. In blood, there were significantly lower concentrations of leptin in female AD than in female controls (g&#x200a;=&#x200a;-0.590; p&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.014), but not in male case-control group (g&#x200a;=&#x200a;-0.666; p&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.067). Meta-regression analysis demonstrated that the decreased extent of leptin levels in AD paralleled the degree of the severity of dementia symptoms, as well as the alterations of body mass index (p-values &#x2264;0.002). The findings provide strong evidence that 1) the blood concentrations of leptin are lower in female AD patients than in female controls; and 2) the greater the severity of dementia symptoms, the greater the decreases in the blood leptin levels. But more future investigations on the blood leptin levels in male AD patients is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome, a risk factor of cardiovascular disease, is more common in patients with psoriasis than in the general population. Circulating adipokine concentrations are altered in patients with psoriasis and are suggested to represent the pathophysiological link between psoriatic lesions and metabolic alterations. To perform a systematic review of the literature for studies that investigated possible differences in circulating levels of leptin, adiponectin or resistin in patients with psoriasis before and after any treatment intervention, and to meta-analyse the best evidence available. A search was conducted in three databases (PubMed, Central and Embase). Eligible for the review were studies that assessed leptin, adiponectin or resistin concentrations in patients with psoriasis before and after any topical or systemic treatment. After treatment, blood concentrations of leptin were similar to those before treatment [standardized mean difference (SMD) 0&#xb7;06, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0&#xb7;09 to 0&#xb7;20], with no heterogeneity among studies (I<sup>2</sup> = 0%, P = 0&#xb7;88).

    "title": "CHEMERIN AND FACTORS RELATED TO CARDIOVASCULAR RISK IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW.",
    "abstract": "To review findings on chemerin and factors related to cardiovascular risk in children and adolescents. A systematic review was performed, according to the standards proposed by the PRISMA guideline, on PubMed, Science Direct, and Lilacs databases. The descriptor chemerin was used in combination with children and adolescent, no time limit applied. The research encompassed only original articles written in English, conducted with human subjects - the adult and elderly populations excluded -, as well as literature reviews, brief communications, letters, and editorials. After independent analyses of the studies by two reviewers, seven articles meeting the eligibility criteria, published between 2012 and 2016, remained for the review. Cross-sectional, prospective, cohort, and case-control studies were included. The importance of chemerin adipokines on the risk factors for cardiovascular disease is demonstrated by its association with obesity and diabetes mellitus, as well as clinical, anthropometric, and biochemical parameters. However, the strength of evidence from these studies is relatively low, due to their heterogeneity, with several limitations such as small samples and consequent lack of representativeness, lack of standardization in dosage methods, cross-sectional design of most studies, and impossibility of extrapolating results. The deregulation of chemerin caused by increased adipose tissue may contribute to the development of cardiovascular diseases, suggesting that this adipokine may play a significant role in early identification of individuals at risk.

    "title": "[Efficacy of probiotics on the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease].",
    "abstract": "Objective: To study the clinical effect of probiotics in the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Methods: A total of 200 patients with NAFLD were randomly divided into 4 groups: control group (routine treatment group) and combined treatment group A, B and C. Each group had equal patients. The control group received orally polyene phosphatidylcholine capsules; whereas combined group A, B and C were given orally the live combined Bifidobacterium Lactobacillus and Enterococcus powder , two live combined Bacillus subtilis and Enterococcus , and the both probiotics respectively. The duration of treatment was 1 month. Laboratory parameters were evaluated before treatment and thirtieth day after treatment, including cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol(LDL-C), alanine aminotransferase(ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), fasting blood glucose (FPG), serum high molecular weight adiponectin (HMW-APN) and serum TNF&#x3b1;. Meanwhile the faece sample was collected for routine test and bacterial culture. Liver ultrasound scan was done in all patients. Results: In terms of blood lipids and blood glucose, each group improved after treatment with significant differences (P&lt;0.05) except for HDL-C. As for liver function, serum ALT and AST decreased after treatment in each group; especially in combined group C which were lower than those of control group [(33.7&#xb1;7.6) U/L vs. (45.0&#xb1;8.5) U/L; (22.0&#xb1;1.6) U/L vs. (29.4&#xb1;3.7) U/L; P&lt;0.05]. TNF&#x3b1; levels decreased after treatment in each group, in addition the values in combined group C was significantly lower than that of control group[(0.51&#xb1;0.27) &#xb5;g/L vs. (0.82&#xb1;0.28) &#xb5;g/L, P&lt;0.05]. Serum HMW-APN increased after treatment in each group, and the HMW-APN in combined C group was significantly higher than that of control group[(9.28&#xb1;3.72) &#xb5;g/L vs. (7.87&#xb1;3.96)&#xb5;g/L, P&lt;0.05]. (5) After treatment, all groups showed improvement of fatty liver by ultrasound, but the difference between groups was not statistically significant. (6) Compared with before treatment, fecal flora in combined groups was all reduced (P&lt;0.01), but it was comparable before and after treatment in control group. Conclusions: Probiotics improve intestinal microecological system in NAFLD patients via inhibiting TNF&#x3b1; and enhancing adiponectin, possibly resulting in regulating blood glucose, lipid metabolism, and protecting liver injury from NAFLD. &#x76ee;&#x7684;&#xff1a;&#x63a2;&#x8ba8;&#x76ca;&#x751f;&#x83cc;&#x8f85;&#x52a9;&#x6cbb;&#x7597;&#x975e;&#x9152;&#x7cbe;&#x6027;&#x8102;&#x80aa;&#x6027;&#x809d;&#x75c5;&#xff08;NAFLD&#xff09;&#x7684;&#x7597;&#x6548;&#x3002;

Clinical and hormonal parameters, insulin secretion evaluated by HOMA-&#x3b2; and by the area under the curve (AUC2h) of C-peptide during a mixed meal tolerance test and insulin sensitivity, evaluated by the euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp, were evaluated in 12 patients with active CD, before and after 6 and 12&#xa0;months of pasireotide. In addition, a panel of adipokines including leptin (Ob), leptin/leptin receptor ratio (Ob/Ob-R ratio), adiponectin, resistin, visfatin, adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (AFABP) and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) was evaluated at baseline and after 12&#xa0;months of pasireotide. During 12&#xa0;months of pasireotide treatment, a significant decrease in weight (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.004), BMI (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.008), waist circumference (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.009), urinary free cortisol (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.007), fasting insulinaemia (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.007), HOMA-&#x3b2; (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.015) and AUC2h c-peptide (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.017), concomitance with an increase in fasting glycaemia (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.015) and HbA1c (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.030), was found.

We enrolled 44 participants with type 2 diabetes who met our inclusion criteria. Eight milligrams of AST supplementation or a placebo were randomly administered once daily for 8 weeks to these participants. The 8-week administration of AST supplementation increased the serum adiponectin concentration and reduced visceral body fat mass (p&lt;0.01), serum triglyceride and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, and systolic blood pressure (p&lt;0.05). Furthermore, AST significantly reduced the fructosamine concentration (p&lt;0.05) and marginally reduced the plasma glucose concentration (p=0.057). We demonstrated that because participants with type 2 diabetes often have hypertriglycemia and uncontrolled glucose metabolism; our findings of dual beneficial effects are clinically valuable. Our results may provide a novel complementary treatment with potential impacts on diabetic complications without adverse effects.",

    "abstract": "Beh&#xe7;et disease (BD) is a chronic inflammatory disease. Adipokines are synthesized in adipose tissue, and have been reported to play important roles in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including BD. To evaluate the relationship between circulating blood adipokine levels and BD. We conducted a meta-analysis of papers reporting on serum/plasma resistin, leptin, adiponectin and visfatin levels in patients with BD and in healthy controls (HCs). We identified 82 relevant studies using electronic and manual search methods, and selected 16 studies for full-text review based on the title and abstract. Two of these were later excluded (one was a review, one had no data), leaving 14 articles that met the inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis. The 14 included studies assessed 637 patients with BD and 520 HCs. Compared with the HCs, the BD group had significantly higher levels of leptin [standardized mean difference (SMD)&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.68, 95% CI 0.15-1.21, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.01]. Levels of resistin&#xa0;(SMD&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.51, 95% CI 0.92-0.918, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.02) and adiponectin (SMD&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.31, 95% CI 0.06-0.56, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.02) were significantly higher in the BD group after adjustment for age, sex and body mass index (BMI), but not without such adjustment (resistin: (SMD&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.38, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.93, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.19; adiponectin: SMD&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.59, 95% CI -2.23 to 1.06, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.48). A significantly lower visfatin level was found in the BD group with adjustment (SMD&#xa0;=&#xa0;-1.70, 95% CI -2.14 to -1.25, P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) but not without adjustment (SMD&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.31, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.82, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.24). Our meta-analysis revealed significantly higher circulating resistin, leptin and adiponectin levels and lower visfatin levels in patients with BD than in HCs, indicating that adipokines probably play an important role in BD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) variants on change in body weight and cardiovascular risk factors after weight loss remains unclear in obese patients. Our aim was to analyze the effects of the rs10767664 BDNF gene polymorphism on body weight, cardiovascular risk factors, and serum adipokine levels after a high monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) hypocaloric diet (diet M) versus a high polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) hypocaloric diet (diet P). A Caucasian population of 361 obese patients was enrolled. Subjects who met the inclusion criteria were randomly allocated to one of two diets for a period of 3 months. Two hundred and sixteen subjects (59.8%) had the genotype AA (wild-type group), and 145 (40.2%) patients had the genotypes AT (122 patients, 33.8%) or TT (23 patients, 6.4%) (mutant-type group). After weight loss with diet P and diet M and in both genotype groups, body mass index, weight, fat mass, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, serum leptin levels, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and total cholesterol decreased in a significant way. Secondary to weight loss with diet M and only in the wild-type group, insulin levels (-2.1 &#xb1; 2.0 vs. -0.7 &#xb1; 2.9 IU/L, p &lt; 0.05) and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (-0.7 &#xb1; 0.9 vs. -0.3 &#xb1; 1.0 U, p &lt; 0.05) decreased. Our data show that the rs10767664 variant of the BDNF gene modifies insulin resistance and insulin levels after weight loss with a hypocaloric diet enriched with MUFAs.",

    "abstract": "The nature of the link (causal vs non-causal) between low 1,25-OH vitamin D and insulin resistance (IR) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains elusive. We have now made a post hoc analysis of the effect of vitamin D receptor activation by paricalcitol on IR in the complete dataset of a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial, the Paricalcitol and ENdothelial fuNction in chronic kidneY disease (PENNY). Eighty-eight patients with stage 3-4 CKD were randomized (1:1) to receive 2&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/day paricalcitol or matching placebo for 12 weeks. IR was measured by five IR indices: the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), the McAuley index, the HOMA corrected for adiponectin (HOMA-AD) and the Leptin-adiponectin ratio (LAR). As compared to placebo, paricalcitol produced the expected small rise in serum calcium (+0.07&#xa0;mmol/L, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.01) and phosphate (+0.08&#xa0;mmol/L, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.034) and the expected parathyroid hormone suppression (-96&#xa0;pg/ml, P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001). However, the drug largely failed to affect the five indices of IR which remained unchanged both in the active and the placebo arm (paricalcitol vs placebo, P ranging from 0.25 to 0.62) and no effect modification of paricalcitol on IR by vitamin D or other parameters was registered. Paricalcitol treatment for 12 weeks does not improve IR in patients with stage 3-4 CKD. Low vitamin D receptor activation is not a causal factor for IR in the CKD population.",

    "abstract": "The fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) response to phosphate load is suppressed in adiponectin gene null mice and substantially amplified in mice overexpressing the same gene and vitamin D receptor (VDR) activation markedly enhances FGF23 gene expression. We performed an analysis of the static (baseline adiponectin levels) and dynamic (fluctuations in adiponectin levels) interactions of serum adiponectin with the FGF23 response to paricalcitol and placebo in the setting of a double-blind, randomized clinical trial in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients (NCT01680198). As compared with placebo, VDR activation by paricalcitol markedly increased serum FGF23 levels (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and such an increase was amplified in patients in the 4th adiponectin quartile as compared with other quartiles (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.009) while no such an effect was noted in the placebo group (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.49). Both baseline adiponectin (P for interaction&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.009) and fluctuations in adiponectin levels following paricalcitol and placebo (P for interaction&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003) strongly modified the difference in the FGF23 response to these treatments. These interactions were specific because no similar effect modification by other factors with the FGF23 response to VDR activation was found. Furthermore, in a global correlation analysis, adiponectin and FGF23 were interrelated independent of the estimated glomerular filtration rate and other potential confounders (&#x3b2; = 0.22, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003). Adiponectin is a strong modifier of the FGF23 response to VDR activation in CKD patients. The adiponectin-FGF23 link discovered in genetically engineered mice is of mechanistic relevance in the FGF23 response to VDR activation in CKD patients.",

    "title": "Protein quantitative trait locus study in obesity during weight-loss identifies a leptin regulator.",
    "abstract": "Thousands of genetic variants have been associated with complex traits through genome-wide association studies. However, the functional variants or mechanistic consequences remain elusive. Intermediate traits such as gene expression or protein levels are good proxies of the metabolic state of an organism. Proteome analysis especially can provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of complex traits like obesity. The role of genetic variation in determining protein level variation has not been assessed in obesity. To address this, we design a large-scale protein quantitative trait locus (pQTL) analysis based on a set of 1129 proteins from 494 obese subjects before and after a weight loss intervention. This reveals 55 BMI-associated cis-pQTLs and trans-pQTLs at baseline and 3 trans-pQTLs after the intervention. We provide evidence for distinct genetic mechanisms regulating BMI-associated proteins before and after weight loss. Finally, by functional analysis, we identify and validate FAM46A as a trans regulator for leptin.",

    "abstract": "Psoriasis is an immune-mediated, inflammatory disease. Adipokines contribute to the regulation of immune-mediated processes and inflammation. The aim of our study was to systematically review the literature for studies that have evaluated the circulating concentrations of adipokines in patients with psoriasis and controls and to meta-analyze the best evidence available. Eligible were studies that have assessed leptin, resistin, or adiponectin concentrations in psoriatic patients and a reference group. The study was conducted in adherence with the PRISMA standards. Psoriatic patients had higher leptin concentrations compared to controls (random effects model, mean difference, MD = 5.64 ng/mL, 95% CI: 3.00-8.29, p &lt; 0.0001). Heterogeneity among studies was high (I2 = 95.9%). Psoriatic patients had higher resistin concentrations compared to controls (MD = 4.66 ng/mL, 95% CI: 2.62-6.69, p &lt; 0.0001). Heterogeneity was high (I2 = 99.2%). Finally, psoriatic patients had lower adiponectin concentrations compared to controls (MD = -1.87 &#x3bc;g/mL, 95% CI: -2.76 to -0.98, p &lt; 0.0001). Heterogeneity was high (I2 = 95.9%). The study supported the hypothesis that leptin and resistin concentrations are higher and adiponectin concentrations are lower in patients with psoriasis compared to controls. Hereby, the suggested pathogenic link between psoriasis and metabolic syndrome/obesity is reinforced and the role of comorbidities in psoriasis is highlighted.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. Our previous study indicated that people with MetS showed a decrease in waist circumference and a decreasing trend in blood pressure after 1-year yoga. This study investigated the effect of yoga on MetS people with high-normal blood pressure by exploring modulations in proinflammatory adipokines (leptin, chemerin, visfatin, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 or PAI-1) and an anti-inflammatory adipokine (adiponectin). A total of 97 Hong Kong Chinese individuals aged 57.6&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;9.1&#xa0;years with MetS and high-normal blood pressure were randomly assigned to control (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;45) and yoga groups (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;52). Participants in the control group were not given any intervention but were contacted monthly to monitor their health status. Participants in the yoga group underwent a yoga training program with three 1-hour yoga sessions weekly for 1&#xa0;year. The participants' sera were harvested and assessed for adipokines. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) was used to examine the interaction effect between 1-year time (pre vs post), and intervention (control vs yoga). GEE analyses revealed significant interaction effects between 1-year time and yoga intervention for the decreases in leptin and chemerin and the increase in adiponectin concentration in the sera examined. These results demonstrated that 1-year yoga training decreased proinflammatory adipokines and increased anti-inflammatory adipokine in adults with MetS and high-normal blood pressure. These findings support the beneficial role of yoga in managing MetS by favorably modulating adipokines.",

A total of 47 participants were randomized into one of the following three groups; control, resistance exercise or combined exercise (aerobic and resistance exercise). The resistance exercise group completed three resistance types of exercise. The combined exercise group completed five exercises, including three resistance types of exercise and two aerobic types of exercise. Participants' body composition, fitness level, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and adipocytokines were measured at baseline and at the end of six weeks. After six weeks of exercise training, participants in the combined exercise group exhibited significant reduction in insulin, HOMA-IR and chemerin levels, while significant reduction was observed in HOMA-IR only in the resistance exercise group compared with the control group. Meanwhile, six weeks of exercise training, whether resistance exercise alone or combined, significantly improved upper body muscular strength/endurance and physical function compared to the control group. Six weeks of combined exercise using outdoor exercise equipment was effective in improving fitness, HOMA-IR, circulating chemerin levels, and other known risk factors of chronic diseases.",

    "abstract": "There is growing evidence that breastfeeding has short- and long-term cardiovascular health benefits for mothers. The objectives of this systematic review were to examine the association between breastfeeding and maternal cardiovascular risk factors and outcomes that have not previously been synthesized systematically, including metabolic syndrome, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. This systematic review meets PRISMA guidelines. The MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL databases were systematically searched for relevant publications of any study design from the earliest publication date to March 2016. The reference lists from selected articles were reviewed, and forward and backward referencing were conducted. The methodological quality of reviewed articles was appraised using validated checklists. Twenty-one studies meeting the inclusion criteria examined the association between self-reported breastfeeding and one or more of the following outcomes: metabolic syndrome/metabolic risk factors (n = 10), inflammatory markers/adipokines (n = 2), hypertension (n = 7), subclinical cardiovascular disease (n = 2), prevalence/incidence of cardiovascular disease (n = 3) and cardiovascular disease mortality (n = 2). Overall, 19 studies (10 cross-sectional/retrospective, 9 prospective) reported significant protective effects of breastfeeding, nine studies (3 cross-sectional/retrospective, 5 prospective, 1 cluster randomized controlled trial) reported non-significant findings and none reported detrimental effects of breastfeeding. In most studies reporting significant associations, breastfeeding remained associated with both short- and long-term maternal cardiovascular health risk factors/outcomes, even after covariate adjustment. Findings from several studies suggested that the effects of breastfeeding may diminish with age and a dose-response association between breastfeeding and several metabolic risk factors. However, further longitudinal studies, including studies that measure exclusive breastfeeding, are needed to confirm these findings. The evidence from this review suggests that breastfeeding is associated with cardiovascular health benefits. However, results should be interpreted with caution as the evidence gathered for each individual outcome was limited by the small number of observational studies. Additional prospective studies are needed. CRD42016047766.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a leading modifiable contributor to breast cancer mortality due to its association with increased recurrence and decreased overall survival rate. Obesity stimulates cancer progression through chronic, low-grade inflammation in white adipose tissue, leading to accumulation of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs), in particular, the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype macrophage. Exercise has been shown to reduce M1 ATMs and increase the more anti-inflammatory M2 ATMs in obese adults. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a 16-week exercise intervention would positively alter ATM phenotype in obese postmenopausal breast cancer survivors. Twenty obese postmenopausal breast cancer survivors were randomized to a 16-week aerobic and resistance exercise (EX) intervention or delayed intervention control (CON). The EX group participated in 16&#xa0;weeks of supervised exercise sessions 3 times/week. Participants provided fasting blood, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and superficial subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue biopsies at baseline and following the 16-week study period. EX participants experienced significant improvements in body composition, cardiometabolic biomarkers, and systemic inflammation (all p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.03 vs. CON). Adipose tissue from EX participants showed a significant decrease in ATM M1 (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001), an increase in ATM M2 (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001), increased adipose tissue secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as adiponectin, and decreased secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF- &#x3b1; (all p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.055). A 16-week aerobic and resistance exercise intervention attenuates adipose tissue inflammation in obese postmenopausal breast cancer survivors. Future large randomized trials are warranted to investigate the impact of exercise-induced reductions in adipose tissue inflammation and breast cancer recurrence.",

    "abstract": "A combination of genetic and environmental factors is involved in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Recent studies have shown that adipocytes play a crucial role, by actively participating in systemic immune responses in IBD patients. But findings remain controversial. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic review has evaluated the roles of adipokines in IBD, considering which this systematic review was undertaken to summarize the effects of these adipokines in IBD pathogenesis. For this review, articles published between 1980 and 2016 were identified from the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Cochrane and Google scholar databases. Thirteen articles were ultimately selected for inclusion in this systematic review. Findings of the present study indicate that some of the adipokines such as leptin, adiponectin and resistin are associated with disease severity, body composition and glucose hemostasis in IBD patients, although some of these associations are stronger than others. Overall findings indicate that some adipokines may play a crucial role in IBD severity or other IBD related outcomes. Further studies are recommended to confirm the results.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin regulates endothelial nitric oxide synthase in endothelial cells, and body fat loss by aerobic exercise training promotes adiponectin secretion. Recently, C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related proteins (CTRPs) have been identified as novel adipokines and are paralogs of adiponectin, but the association between exercise training-induced reduction of arterial stiffness and circulating CTRPs levels remains unclear. This study aimed to clarify whether the reduction of arterial stiffness in middle-aged and older adults is associated with the change in serum levels of CTRPs induced by exercise training. A total of 52 middle-aged and older participants were randomly divided into two groups: a training group ( n = 26) and a sedentary control group ( n = 26). Participants in the training group completed 8 wk of aerobic exercise training (60-70% peak oxygen uptake for 45 min, 3 days/wk). The reduction of percent whole body fat, abdominal visceral fat area, and carotid-femoral pulse-wave velocity (cfPWV) was significantly greater in the training group than in the control group ( P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the increase in serum adiponectin, CTRP3, and CTRP5 from baseline to 8 wk was significantly higher in the training group compared with the control group ( P &lt; 0.05). Additionally, the training-induced change in cfPWV was negatively correlated with the training-induced change in serum adiponectin, CTRP3, and CTRP5 levels ( r&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.51, r&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.48, r&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.42, respectively, P &lt; 0.05), and increased plasma nitrite/nitrate level by exercise training was correlated only with adiponectin levels ( r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.41, P &lt; 0.05). These results suggest that the exercise training-induced increase in serum CTRPs levels may be associated with the reduction of arterial stiffness in middle-aged and older adults.",

    "abstract": "Various studies have researched the serum levels of leptin, adiponectin and resistin in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), but the results were inconclusive. The purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate the correlations between serum levels of these adipokines and AS. Electronic databases were retrieved to search relevant publications. Pooled standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated by the random-effect model. Cochrane Q test and I<sup>2</sup> statistic were used to test heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were applied to assess possible sources of heterogeneity. A total of sixteen articles were included. Meta-analysis results indicated no statistical differences between AS patients and normal controls in serum leptin and adiponectin levels (leptin, SMD=0.829, 95% CI=-0.116 to 1.774, p=0.085; adiponectin, SMD=0.460, 95% CI=-0.004 to 0.924, p=0.052).

Subgroup analyses suggested that Asian and African AS patients as well as patients aged &lt;40years had higher serum leptin and resistin levels when compared to controls. Serum adiponectin levels were higher in AS patients compared to controls in subgroup of age &#x2265;40, and serum resistin levels in subgroup of BMI &#x2265;25. Measurement method was a source of heterogeneity for resistin. Publication bias was not observed and the robustness of study results was confirmed by sensitivity analysis. Serum resistin, but not leptin or adiponectin levels may be closely associated with the development of AS.",

    "abstract": "Obesity exacerbates age-related decline in glucometabolic control. Undercarboxylated osteocalcin (UcOC) regulates pancreatic insulin secretion. The long-term effect of lifestyle interventions on UcOC and insulin secretion has not been investigated. One hundred seven frail, obese older adults were randomized into the control (N = 27), diet (N = 26), exercise (N = 26), and diet-exercise (N = 28) groups for 1 year. Main outcomes included changes in UcOC and disposition index (DI). UcOC increased in the diet group (36&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;11.6%) but not in the other groups (P &lt; 0.05 between groups). Although similar increases in DI occurred in the diet-exercise and diet groups at 6 months, DI increased more in the diet-exercise group (92.4&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;11.4%) than in the diet group (61.9&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;15.3%) at 12 months (P &lt; 0.05). UcOC and body composition changes predicted DI variation in the diet group only (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.712), while adipocytokines and physical function changes contributed to DI variation in both the diet (&#x2206;R<sup>2</sup> = 0.140 and 0.107) and diet-exercise (&#x2206;R<sup>2</sup> = 0.427 and 0.243) groups (P &lt; 0.05 for all). Diet, but not exercise or both, increases UcOC, whereas both diet and diet-exercise increase DI. UcOC accounts for DI variation only during active weight loss, while adipocytokines and physical function contribute to diet-exercise-induced DI variation, highlighting different mechanisms for lifestyle-induced improvements in insulin secretion. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00146107.",

    "abstract": "Higher serum adiponectin in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients mitigates the inflammatory response. Previous studies investigated serum adiponectin level in SLE patients compared with control subjects, yielding inconsistent results. The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the difference between serum adiponectin levels in SLE patients compared with control subjects. MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched from inception to August 31, 2016, to identify all observational studies that examined the relationship between serum adiponectin levels and SLE. The study quality was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Standard mean difference values and 95% confidence intervals were estimated and pooled using the meta-analysis methodology. The Cochrane Q test and I statistics were used to test heterogeneity. To assess publication bias, visual observations of a funnel plot were used. The Stata software (version 11.0) was used for statistical analysis. A total of 8 studies including 782 SLE patients and 550 control subjects were eligible for the meta-analysis. In overall random-effects model including all the studies, we found that patients with SLE had higher serum adiponectin levels than control subjects (eight studies; pooled standardized mean difference, 0.502 &#x3bc;g/mL; 95% confidence interval, 0.021-0.984; I = 94.0%; P &lt; 0.001). In subgroup analyses, SLE patients with body mass index of 25 kg/m or greater had higher serum adiponectin levels compared with control subjects. Collectively, our results demonstrate that higher serum adiponectin level is significantly associated with SLE. Furthermore, they suggest that serum adiponectin levels in SLE patients are not correlated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index scores. Imbalanced adiponectin levels might be associated with onset of other chronic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Obesity, metabolic syndrome, and hyperleptinemia are associated with aging and age-associated diseases including prostate cancer. One experimental approach to inhibit tumor growth is to reduce dietary protein intake and hence levels of circulating amino acids. Dietary protein restriction (PR) increases insulin sensitivity and suppresses prostate cancer cell tumor growth in animal models, providing a rationale for clinical trials. We sought to demonstrate that biomarkers derived from plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) reflect systemic leptin and insulin signaling and respond to dietary interventions. We studied plasma samples from men with prostate cancer awaiting prostatectomy who participated in a randomized trial of one month of PR or control diet. We found increased levels of leptin receptor in the PR group in total plasma EVs and in a subpopulation of plasma EVs expressing the neuronal marker L1CAM. Protein restriction also shifted the phosphorylation status of the insulin receptor signal transducer protein IRS1 in L1CAM+ EVs in a manner suggestive of improved insulin sensitivity. Dietary PR modifies indicators of leptin and insulin signaling in circulating EVs. These findings are consistent with improved insulin and leptin sensitivity in response to PR and open a new window for following physiologic responses to dietary interventions in humans.",

    "abstract": "Obesity has become a public health problem and is a cause of some preventable illnesses. Among several methods for treating obesity, the use of food supplements is highly common. A commonly used food supplement is green coffee bean extract. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of green coffee bean extract combined with an energy-restricted diet on the body composition and serum adipocytokines in obese women. In this randomised clinical trial, 64 obese women aged 20-45 years were selected and divided into two groups: an intervention group (receiving 400 mg green coffee bean extract for 8 weeks) and control group (receiving placebo). All participants were on an energy-restricted diet. The body composition, leptin, adiponectin, lipid profile, free fatty acids (FFAs), and fasting blood sugar were compared between the two groups. We observed significant reductions in the body weight, body mass and fat mass indices, and waist-to-hip circumference ratio in both groups; however, the decrease was higher in the intervention group. Moreover, serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, leptin, and plasma free fatty acids significantly decreased in the intervention group (p&lt;0.05) after adjustment for energy and fibre intake. The serum adiponectin concentration significantly increased in the intervention group (p&lt;0.05). Green coffee bean extract combined with an energy-restricted diet affects fat accumulation and lipid metabolism and is thus an inexpensive method for weight control in obese people.",

    "abstract": "Curcumin is a naturally occurring polyphenol that has been suggested to improve several metabolic diseases. Leptin is an adipokine involved in metabolic status and appetite, with marked crosstalk with other systems. Available data suggest that curcumin may affect leptin levels; therefore, this meta-analysis was performed to evaluate this. A systematic review and meta-analysis were undertaken on all randomized controlled trials of curcumin studies that included the measurement of leptin. The search included PubMed-Medline, Scopus, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Google Scholar databases. Quantitative data synthesis was performed by using a random-effects model, with standardized mean difference and 95% confidence interval as summary statistics. A funnel plot, Begg's rank correlation, and Egger's weighted regression tests assessed the presence of publication bias. Four eligible articles comprising five treatment arms were selected for the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis showed a significant decrease in plasma leptin concentrations following curcumin treatment (standardized mean difference: -0.69, 95% confidence interval: -1.16, -0.23, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.003; I<sup>2</sup> &#xa0;=&#xa0;76.53%). There was no evidence of publication bias.

    "title": "Signals from the Adipose Microenvironment and the Obesity-Cancer Link-A Systematic Review.",
    "abstract": "Obesity and its associated metabolic dysregulation are established risk factors for many cancers. However, the biologic mechanisms underlying this relationship remain incompletely understood. Given the rising rates of both obesity and cancer worldwide, and the challenges for many people to lose excess adipose tissue, a systematic approach to identify potential molecular and metabolic targets is needed to develop effective mechanism-based strategies for the prevention and control of obesity-driven cancer. Epidemiologic, clinical, and preclinical data suggest that within the growth-promoting, proinflammatory microenvironment accompanying obesity, crosstalk between adipose tissue (comprised of adipocytes, macrophages and other cells) and cancer-prone cells may occur via obesity-associated hormones, cytokines, and other mediators that have been linked to increased cancer risk and/or progression. We report here a systematic review on the direct crosstalk between adipose tissue and carcinomas in humans. We identified 4,641 articles with n = 20 human clinical studies, which are summarized as: (i) breast (n = 7); (ii) colorectal (n = 4); (iii) esophageal (n = 2); (iv) esophageal/colorectal (n = 1); (v) endometrial (n = 1); (vi) prostate (n = 4); and (vii) ear-nose-throat (ENT) cancer (n = 1). Findings from these clinical studies reinforce preclinical data and suggest organ-dependent crosstalk between adipose tissue and carcinomas via VEGF, IL6, TNF&#x3b1;, and other mechanisms. Moreover, visceral white adipose tissue plays a more central role, as it is more bioenergetically active and is associated with a more procancer secretome than subcutaneous adipose tissue. Efforts to eavesdrop and ultimately interfere with this cancer-enhancing crosstalk may lead to new targets and strategies for decreasing the burden of obesity-related cancers.

    "abstract": "Adipokines are mediators of body composition and are involved in obesity-related complications such as cardiovascular disease. Omega-3 supplementation has not been studied in the setting of body composition and follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1) levels in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). This study aimed to investigate the effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (&#x3c9;-3 PUFA) supplementation on body composition indices and serum levels of FSTL1 in CAD patients. A total of 42 male (aged 45-65 years) subjects with angiographically confirmed CAD were included in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial study. The subjects were randomly divided into omega-3 and placebo groups. During the 8-week intervention, the omega-3 group received 1,200 mg of omega-3 daily, while the placebo group received paraffin. Before and after the study, anthropometric measurements and body composition components were taken; serum FSTL1 levels were assessed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. In the omega-3 group, a significant 27.6% increase in serum FSTL1 was seen after 8 weeks of intervention ( p = .001), but no significant difference in posttreatment levels of FSTL1 was observed between the two groups ( p &gt; .05). At the end of the study, a significant decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C; 94.29 &#xb1; 22.04 vs. 112.24 &#xb1; 24.5; p = .01) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP; 1.92 &#xb1; 0.79 vs. 3.19 &#xb1; 2.51; p = .03) concentration was detected between the two groups. Changes in fasting blood sugar, fasting insulin, body composition, and anthropometric parameters were not significant within and between the groups. Oral omega-3 might increase FSTL1 and decrease LDL-C and hs-CRP concentrations in CAD patients. However, omega-3 supplementation did not have any effect on FSTL1 levels between the groups.",

Meta-regression and exploration of heterogeneity was performed using publication year, age, gender, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, plasma versus serum measurements and immunoassay type. A total of 175 studies were combined to review 51 analytes in 13&#x2009;344 AD and 12&#x2009;912 HC patients.

    "abstract": "To address the complex phenomenon of pediatric obesity, one must understand the physiological mechanisms regulating energy intake and inflammation. The peptide hormones leptin, ghrelin, and adiponectin are involved in both, but their functions are dysregulated in obesity. The purpose of this systematic review is (1) to characterize studies of nutrition interventions for weight management in children who measure these peptides as outcomes, (2) to assess risk of bias in the studies, and (3) to determine the relationships between these peptides and body mass index (BMI). Eligibility Criteria: Peer-reviewed articles written in English, published in 2001-2016, and describing randomized controlled trials of pediatric interventions involving a nutrition component with the outcome measures leptin, ghrelin, and/or adiponectin were included. Articles were excluded if the intervention involved pharmaceuticals, supplements, infant formula, breastfeeding, or surgery. The 25 international studies represented 2,153 obese children. Ten diets were identified. Successful interventions included both structured exercise and hypocaloric dietary components, with or without counseling, resistance training, or medical components. Direct measures of adiposity were used in 69% of studies. Comparison group designs were disparate. Leptin levels decreased as BMI decreased. Evidence regarding the relationships of ghrelin and adiponectin with BMI was inconclusive. Despite known effects of maturation on hormones, studies did not consistently differentiate findings by maturational stage. Common anti-inflammatory and disease risk modification diets were missing or underrepresented. Studies that include children with comorbidities are needed. BMI and leptin levels have a positive relationship, but evidence on ghrelin and adiponectin was inconclusive.",

    "title": "Metabolic and Inflammatory Changes with Orlistat and Sibutramine Treatment in Obese Malaysian Subjects.",
    "abstract": "Obesity is associated with numerous health problems, particularly metabolic and cardiovascular complications. This study aimed to assess the effects that, nine months of pharmacological intervention with orlistat or sibutramine, on obese Malaysians' body weight and compositions, metabolic profiles and inflammatory marker. Seventy-six obese subjects were randomly placed into two groups. The first group received three daily 120 mg dosages of orlistat for nine months (n=39), and the second group received a once daily 10 or 15 mg dosage of sibutramine for nine months (n=37). Baseline measurements for weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), body fat percentage (BF), visceral fat (VF), adiponectin, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting insulin, pancreatic B cell secretory capacity (HOMA%B), insulin sensitivity (HOMA%S), insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were performed and repeated during the sixth and ninth months of treatment. Twenty-four subjects completed the trial in both groups. For both groups, weight, BMI, WC, BF, VF, HOMA-IR and hs-CRP were significantly lower at the end of the nine month intervention. However, there were no significant differences between the two groups for these parameters with nine months treatment. There was a significant decrease in FPG in orlistat group; while fasting insulin and HOMA%B reduced in sibutramine group. For both groups, there were also significant increases in adiponectin levels and HOMA%S at the end of the nine month intervention. Nine months of treatment with orlistat and sibutramine not only reduced weight but also significantly improved BMI, WC, BF, VF, FPG, adiponectin, fasting insulin, HOMA%B, HOMA%S, HOMA-IR and hs-CRP. These improvements could prove useful in the reduction of metabolic and cardiovascular risks in obese subjects.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is an age-related chronic disease associated with metabolic dysregulation, chronic inflammation, and activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The aim of this study was to assess the effects of a concurrent exercise training program on inflammatory status and metabolic parameters of T2D patients. Sixteen male patients (age range 55-70) were randomly assigned to an intervention group (n = 8), which underwent a concurrent aerobic and resistance training program (3 times a week; 16 weeks), or to a control group, which followed physicians' usual diabetes care advices. Training intervention significantly improved patients' body composition, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and overall fitness level. After training, plasma levels of adipokines leptin (-33.9%) and RBP4 (-21.3%), and proinflammatory markers IL-6 (-25.3%), TNF-&#x3b1; (-19.8%) and MCP-1 (-15.3%) decreased, whereas anabolic hormone IGF-1 level increased (+16.4%). All improvements were significantly greater than those of control patients. Plasma proteomic profile of exercised patients showed a reduction of immunoglobulin K light chain and fibrinogen as well. Training also induced a modulation of IL-6, IGF-1, and IGFBP-3 mRNAs in the PBMCs. These findings confirm that concurrent aerobic and resistance training improves T2D-related metabolic abnormalities and has the potential to reduce the deleterious health effects of diabetes-related inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin plays an important role in the development of immune-mediated diseases. Currently published data regarding the relationship between serum/plasma levels of adiponectin and immune-mediated diseases are inconsistent. We therefore conducted this meta-analysis to explore the association of serum/plasma adiponectin levels with immune-mediated diseases in humans. Systematic literature search was conducted to identify all relevant studies. The study quality was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Pooled standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated by random-effect model analysis. A total of 47 studies were included in our meta-analysis, including 27 studies of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), 9 studies of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 7 studies of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and 4 studies of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). The results revealed significant differences in serum/plasma levels of adiponectin between immune-mediated diseases and normal controls (SMD&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.262, 95% CI 0.766-1.758, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001). In the subgroup analysis stratified by disease type, the serum/plasma levels of adiponectin in T1DM, RA and SLE patients were higher than those in normal control, but not in AS patients. Moreover, in the subgroup analysis stratified by gender, in both men and women group, the serum/plasma levels of adiponectin in patients with immune-mediated diseases were higher than that in the control group. Furthermore, subgroup analyses also showed that immune-mediated diseases from Asian population, Caucasian population, mean age&#xa0;&gt;40&#xa0;years, and BMI&#xa0;&#x2265;24&#xa0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> had higher serum/plasma adiponectin levels when compared with normal controls. Collectively, this meta-analysis demonstrates that serum/plasma levels of adiponectin in T1DM, RA and SLE patients were higher than those in normal controls, but not in AS patients.",

    "abstract": "Numerous rodent studies have evaluated the effects of a maternal high-fat diet (HFD) on later in life susceptibility to Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) with varying results. Our aim was to quantitatively synthesize the available data on effects of maternal HFD around gestation on offspring's body mass, body fat, plasma leptin, glucose, insulin, lipids and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Literature was screened and summary estimates of the effect of maternal HFD on outcomes were calculated by using fixed- or random-effects models. 362 effect sizes from 68 studies together with relevant moderators were collected. We found that maternal HFD is statistically associated with higher body fat, body weight, leptin, glucose, insulin and triglycerides levels, together with increased SBP in offspring later in life. Our analysis also revealed non-significant overall effect on offspring's HDL-cholesterol. A main source of variation among studies emerged from rat strain and lard-based diet type. Strain and sex -specific effects on particular data subsets were detected. Recommendations are suggested for future research in the field of developmental programming of the MetS. Despite significant heterogeneity, our meta-analysis confirms that maternal HFD had long-term metabolic effects in offspring.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the difference in serum levels of leptin and adiponectin in patients with periodontitis and in periodontally healthy individuals and evaluate the changes in circulating leptin and adiponectin after periodontal therapy. Leptin and adiponectin are the most generally studied adipokines that function as inflammatory cytokines. Although the association between periodontitis and serum levels of leptin and adiponectin has been studied extensively, the results were not consistent. A systematic search of the Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library up to September 2016 was conducted. The studies were screened and selected by two writers according to the specific eligibility criteria. The quality of included cross-sectional studies was assessed using the quality assessment form recommended by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and Methodological Index for Nonrandomized Studies. The meta-analyses were conducted using the STATA 12.0 software. A total of 399 manuscripts were yielded and 25 studies were included in the present meta-analysis. Significantly elevated serum levels of leptin and decreased serum levels of adiponectin in patients with periodontitis were observed in the subgroup analysis of body mass index (BMI) &lt;30. The overall and subgroup analyses showed no significant change in the serum levels of leptin in patients with periodontitis after periodontal treatment. The subgroup analysis of systemically healthy patients showed no significant change in serum levels of adiponectin in patients with periodontitis after periodontal treatment. The present meta-analysis supported elevated serum levels of leptin and decreased serum levels of adiponectin in patients with periodontitis compared with controls in the BMI &lt;30 population. In systemically healthy patients with periodontitis, serum levels of leptin and adiponectin do not significantly change after periodontal treatment.",

    "title": "Metabolic effect of obesity on polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents: a meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "This meta-analysis provides an updated and comprehensive estimate of the effects of obesity on metabolic disorders in adolescent polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Relevant articles consistent with the search terms published up to 31 January 2014 were retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CENTRAL. Thirteen articles (16 independent studies) conformed to the inclusion criteria. The evaluated outcomes were the metabolic parameters of obese adolescents with PCOS (case group) relative to normal-weight adolescents with PCOS, or obese adolescents without PCOS. Compared with normal-weight adolescents with PCOS, the case group had significantly lower sex hormone-binding globulin and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and significantly higher triglycerides, leptin, fasting insulin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and free testosterone levels. Relative to obese adolescents without PCOS, the case group had significantly higher fasting insulin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, free testosterone levels and 2-h glucose during the oral glucose tolerance test. These results indicate that metabolic disorders in adolescent PCOS are worsened by concomitant obesity. This study highlights the importance of preventing obesity during the management of adolescent PCOS. Impact statement What is already known about this subject: Obesity and PCOS share many of the same metabolic disorders, for example, hyperandrogenism and hyperinsulinemia with subsequent insulin resistance. Knowledge regarding metabolic features in obese adolescents with PCOS is limited, and there is concern whether obesity and PCOS are related. What do the results of this study add: Relative to PCOS adolescents of normal weight, obese adolescents with PCOS (the case group) had significantly lower SHBG and HDL-C, and significantly higher triglycerides, leptin, fasting insulin, LDL-C and free testosterone levels. The results indicate that metabolic disorders in adolescent PCOS are worsened by concomitant obesity. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research: Obesity, metabolic disorders and PCOS in adolescents are associated. Obesity exacerbates metabolic disorders in adolescent PCOS. This study highlights the importance of preventing obesity during the management of adolescent PCOS. Therapeutic intervention combined with lifestyle modification may provide better treatment for adolescent PCOS. The aetiologies of PCOS combined with obesity in adolescents require further investigation.",

    "abstract": "While lifestyle modification is known to offer several metabolic benefits, there is paucity of comprehensive data on changes in biomarkers of adiposity, inflammation as well as gut hormones. We investigated these biomarkers in overweight/obese individuals with prediabetes randomized to either 4&#xa0;months of a lifestyle improvement program or standard care and followed them up for a year. Participants [standard care and intervention arm (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;75 each)] were randomly selected from the Diabetes Community Lifestyle Improvement Program trial. Glycemic and lipid control and anthropometric measurements were assessed by standard protocols. Adipokines, inflammatory markers and gut hormones were measured using multiplex and standard ELISA kits. Along with modest benefits in primary outcomes (glycemic and lipid control and weight reduction), participants in the intervention group showed significant reductions (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) in plasma levels of leptin (17.6%), TNF-&#x3b1; (35%), IL-6 (33.3%), MCP-1 (22.3%) and PYY (28.3%) and increased levels of adiponectin (33.1%) and ghrelin (23.6%) at the end of 4&#xa0;months of lifestyle intervention. The changes were independent of weight and persisted even at 1&#xa0;year of follow-up. In contrast, participants from the standard care arm did not show any statistically significant improvements on the above parameters. Participants who underwent an intensive lifestyle improvement program showed metabolic benefits as well as favorable beneficial changes in systemic levels of adipokines, cytokines and gut hormones, not only during the intervention period, but also during 12-month follow-up period.",

    "abstract": "Previous research indicates a role of adipokines in inflammation and osteogenesis. Hence adipokines might also have a pathophysiological role in inflammation and new bone formation in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). The aim of this study was to investigate the role of adipokine serum levels as predictors of radiographic spinal progression in patients with AS. A total of 120 patients with definite AS who completed a&#xfeff; 2-year follow up in the ENRADAS trial were included in the current study. Radiographic spinal progression was defined as: (1) worsening of the modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis spine (mSASSS) score by &#x2265;2 points and/or (2) new syndesmophyte formation or progression of existing syndesmophytes after 2&#xa0;years. Serum levels of adipokines (adiponectin (APN) and its high molecular weight form (HMW-APN), chemerin, leptin, lipocalin-2, omentin, resistin, visfatin) were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. There was&#xa0;a significant association between radiographic spinal progression and both leptin and HMW-APN. Baseline serum levels of both adipokines were lower in patients who showed radiographic spinal progression after 2&#xa0;years. This association was especially evident in men; they had generally lower leptin and HMW-APN serum levels as compared to women. The inverse association between adipokines and radiographic spinal progression was confirmed in the logistic regression analysis: the odds ratios (OR) for the outcome no mSASSS progression &#x2265;2 points were 1.16 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.29) and 1.17 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.38), for leptin and HMW-APN, respectively; for no syndesmophyte formation/progression the respective OR were 1.29 (95% CI 1.11 to 1.50) and 1.18 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.42), adjusted for the presence of syndesmophytes at baseline, C-reactive protein at baseline, sex, body mass index (BMI), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs intake score over 2&#xa0;years, and smoking status at baseline. Serum leptin and HMW-APN predict protection from spinal radiographic progression in patients with AS. Women generally have higher leptin and HMW-APN serum levels that might explain why they have less structural damage in the spine as compared to male patients with AS. EudraCT: 2007-007637-39.

Adiponectin gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with CAD susceptibility, but with inconsistent results across the studies. We present, in this study, an updated meta-analysis to discern the genetic susceptibility of adiponectin SNPs in relation to CAD. PubMed and EMBASE databases were used to identify the relevant published articles using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

In this study, a North American cohort with obesity enrolled in a lifestyle modification program was examined to determine the impact of weight loss on NAFLD resolution and sarcopenia. Nondiabetic individuals with World Health Organization Class II/III obesity enrolled in a 6-month weight loss intervention were included. Steatosis was measured using computed tomography (CT)-derived liver:spleen attenuation ratio.

    "abstract": "The growing prevalence of childhood obesity has become a serious health problem over the past decades. As the immune system is greatly affected by excess weight, in this review of reviews, we discuss the findings of review articles about the relationship between childhood/maternal obesity and children's immune system. We searched English-language articles in PubMed, Scopus, ISI Thomson Reuters, and Google Scholar databases. All relevant reviews, either systematic or narrative, were retrieved. Then their quality was assessed by using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews and International Narrative Systematic Assessment tools, respectively. In the final step, 26 reviews were included. Our review suggests that childhood obesity is associated with extensive changes in the serum levels of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and proteins, as well as the number of immune cells and their behavior. Therefore, it might cause or exacerbate diseases such as asthma, allergy, atopic dermatitis (AD), and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Moreover, childhood obesity may reduce the immune system responsiveness to vaccines and microorganisms. Furthermore, studies suggest that maternal obesity increases the risk of asthma in offspring. Future studies are needed to determine different associations of childhood obesity with allergy, atophic dermatitis, and autoimmune diseases.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes has been associated with an increase in inflammatory and endothelial biomarkers, which are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes-related complications. This study examined the effects of high-intensity progressive resistance training (PRT) with moderate weight loss (WL) versus WL alone on inflammatory and endothelial biomarkers in older overweight adults with type 2 diabetes. This was a 12-month randomized controlled trial in which 36 inactive, overweight adults aged 60-80&#xa0;years with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes were randomized to 6 months of supervised PRT&#xa0;+&#xa0;WL or stretching (sham) exercise plus WL followed by 6&#xa0;months of home-training without dietary modification. Fasted blood samples were collected at baseline and subsequent 3-month intervals with the following inflammatory [interleukin (IL)-10, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x3b1;, adiponectin] and endothelial markers [resistin and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1)] assessed. No significant within-group changes or between-group differences were detected for any inflammatory or endothelial biomarker following the 6-month supervised exercise and WL phase. There was a greater reduction in IL-10 at 9 months in the PRT&#xa0;+&#xa0;WL relative to WL group (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.033). There was also a greater reduction in TNF-&#x3b1; at 9 and 12 months in the PRT&#xa0;+&#xa0;WL relative to WL group (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.026 and P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.024, respectively). Serum adiponectin increased in the PRT&#xa0;+&#xa0;WL relative to WL group after 12 months (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.036). All results were adjusted for baseline values, age, weight, sex, diabetes duration, medication use and any change in medication. Long-term participation in PRT, independent of change in weight, can result in some improvements in certain inflammatory markers in older overweight adults with type 2 diabetes.",

    "title": "The role of endothelial cells in the vasculopathy of systemic sclerosis: A systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune connective tissue disorder characterized by fibroproliferative vasculopathy, immunological abnormalities and progressive fibrosis of multiple organs including the skin. In this study, all English speaking articles concerning the role of endothelial cells (ECs) in SSc vasculopathy and representing biomarkers are systematically reviewed and categorized according to endothelial cell (EC) (dys)function in SSc. A sensitive search on behalf of the EULAR study group on microcirculation in Rheumatic Diseases was developed in Pubmed, The Cochrane Library and Web of Science to identify articles on SSc vasculopathy and the role of ECs using the following Mesh terms: (systemic sclerosis OR scleroderma) AND pathogenesis AND (endothelial cells OR marker). All selected papers were read and discussed by two independent reviewers. The selection process was based on title, abstract and full text level. Additionally, both reviewers further searched the reference lists of the articles selected for reading on full text level for supplementary papers. These additional articles went through the same selection process. In total 193 resulting articles were selected and the identified biomarkers were categorized according to description of EC (dys)function in SSc. The most representing and reliable biomarkers described by the selected articles were adhesion molecules for EC activation, anti-endothelial cell antibodies for EC apoptosis, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), its receptor VEGFR-2 and endostatin for disturbed angiogenesis, endothelial progenitors cells for defective vasculogenesis, endothelin-1 for disturbed vascular tone control, Von Willebrand factor for coagulopathy and interleukin (IL)-33 for EC-immune system communication. Emerging, relatively new discovered biomarkers described in the selected articles, are VEGF165b, IL-17A and the adipocytokines. Finally, myofibroblasts involved in tissue fibrosis in SSc can derive from ECs or epithelial cells through a process known as endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition. This systematic review emphasizes the growing evidence that SSc is primarily a vascular disease where EC dysfunction is present and prominent in different aspects of cell survival (activation and apoptosis), angiogenesis and vasculogenesis and where disturbed interactions between ECs and various other cells contribute to SSc vasculopathy.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate, in a randomized clinical trial, the effects of metformin immediate release (IR) compared with metformin extended release (XR) on the gastrointestinal tolerability and glycemic control. We enrolled 253 Caucasian patients with type 2 diabetes not well controlled by diet (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] &gt;7.0% and &lt;8.5%). Patients were randomized to metformin IR or metformin XR for a period of 6 months at the maximum tolerated dose. The average dose of metformin IR used was 2,000&#xb1;1,000 mg/day, while that of metformin XR was 1,000&#xb1;500 mg/day. We evaluated body weight, HbA1c, fasting and postprandial glucose, fasting plasma insulin (FPI) and homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), lipid profile, and levels of some adipocytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1; (TNF-&#x3b1;), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), visfatin, and vaspin. Moreover, at the baseline and after 6 months, we administered patients some validated questionnaires to assess patients' satisfaction toward treatments. After 6 months, both formulations gave a similar reduction in body weight and body mass index (BMI); however, metformin XR gave a greater improvement in glycemic control, FPI, and HOMA-IR, compared with both baseline and metformin IR. A reduction in total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was observed with metformin XR compared with IR. Levels of TNF-&#x3b1;, hs-CRP, and vaspin were reduced by metformin XR but not by the IR formulation. Metformin XR also raised the levels of visfatin. Metformin XR formulation seems to be more effective than metformin IR in improving glyco-metabolic control, lipid profile, and levels of some adipocytokines in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have suggested the involvement of adipokines in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension. In this study, we evaluated the significance of serum resistin levels in hypertensive patients using a meta-analysis approach. Relevant articles were retrieved by searching the following databases: PubMed, Embase, Ovid Medline, ISI Web of Knowledge. The retrieved studies were subjected to a thorough screening procedure to identify case-control studies that contained the required data. Data were extracted from each study and analyzed by Stata software and Review Manager software. In total, 14 case-control studies, containing 718 hypertensive patients and 645 normotensive controls, were included in this study. The major result of the meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant association between serum resistin concentration and hypertension (SMD = 0.85, 95% CI: [0.15, 1.54]), and the association was more obvious in Asian and Hispanic populations, diabetic population and studies with larger size cohorts. Publication bias was a low probability event for overall comparisons. Based on our results, we conclude that serum resistin level in hypertensive patients is higher than normotensive controls, indicating resistin might be a risk factor for hypertension.",

    "abstract": "Men with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) often have lowered testosterone levels and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Ectopic fat increases the risk of CVD, whereas subcutaneous gluteofemoral fat protects against CVD and has a beneficial adipokine-secreting profile. Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) may reduce the content of ectopic fat and improve the adipokine profile in men with T2D. A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in 39 men aged 50-70 years with T2D and bioavailable testosterone levels &lt;7.3&#x2009;nmol/L. Patients were randomized to TRT (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;20) or placebo gel (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;19) for 24 weeks. Thigh subcutaneous fat area (TFA, %fat of total thigh volume), subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (SAT, % fat of total abdominal volume) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT, % fat of total abdominal volume) were measured by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Hepatic fat content was estimated by single-voxel MR spectroscopy. Adiponectin and leptin levels were measured by in-house immunofluorometric assay. Coefficients (b) represent the placebo-controlled mean effect of intervention. TFA (b&#x2009;=&#x2009;-3.3 percentage points (pp), P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.009), SAT (b&#x2009;=&#x2009;-3.0&#x2009;pp, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.006), levels of adiponectin (b&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.4&#x2009;mg/L, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.045), leptin (b&#x2009;=&#x2009;-4.3&#x2009;&#xb5;g/mL, P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), leptin:adiponectin ratio (b&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.53, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001) and HDL cholesterol (b&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.11&#x2009;mmol/L, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.009) decreased during TRT compared with placebo. Hepatic fat content and VAT were unchanged. The effects of TRT on cardiovascular risk markers were ambiguous. We observed potentially harmful changes in cardiovascular risk parameters, markedly reduced subcutaneous fat and unchanged ectopic fat during TRT and a reduction in adiponectin levels. On the other hand, the decrease in leptin and leptin:adiponectin ratio assessments could reflect an amelioration of the cardiovascular risk profile linked to hyperleptinaemia in ageing men with T2D.",

    "abstract": "The beneficial effects of mineralocorticoid receptor blockade by spironolactone have been shown in animal models of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of the present 52-week randomized controlled trial was to compare the effects of low-dose spironolactone and vitamin E combination with those of vitamin E monotherapy on insulin resistance, non-invasive indices of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, liver function tests, circulating adipokines and hormones in patients with histologically confirmed NAFLD. Homeostasis model of assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and non-invasive indices of steatosis and fibrosis were calculated. Analysis was intention-to-treat. NAFLD liver fat score, an index of steatosis, decreased significantly in the combination treatment group (P = .028), but not in the vitamin E group, and the difference for group*time interaction was significant (P = .047). Alanine aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index, an index of fibrosis, did not change. Insulin levels and HOMA-IR decreased significantly only within the combination group (P = .011 and P = .011, respectively). In conclusion, the combined low-dose spironolactone plus vitamin E regimen significantly decreased NAFLD liver fat score. Larger-scale trials are needed to clarify the effect of low-dose spironolactone on hepatic histology.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of turmeric supplementation on glycemic status and serum leptin levels in patients with NAFLD. This double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted on 46 patients with NAFLD (21males and 25 females) aged 20-60&#xa0;years old and body mass index (BMI) between 24.9 and 40&#xa0;kg/m2.

The placebo group (n = 23) was given six placebo capsules daily for the same period. Fasting blood samples, anthropometric measurements, and physical activity levels were collected at the baseline and at the end of the study. Daily dietary intakes also were obtained throughout the study. Data were analyzed by independent t test, paired t test and analysis of covariance. Turmeric consumption decreased serum levels of glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR and leptin (by 1.22, 17.69, 19.48 and 21.33% respectively, p &lt; 0.05 for all) over 12 weeks compared with those variables in the placebo group. Changes in weight, BMI and liver enzymes were not significant compared to the placebo group. Turmeric supplementation improved glucose indexes and serum leptin levels and may be useful in the control of NAFLD complications.",

    "abstract": "Observational evidence regarding the role of leptin in Alzheimer disease (AD) is conflicting. We sought to determine the causal role of circulating leptin and soluble plasma leptin receptor (sOB-R) levels in AD using a separate-sample Mendelian randomization study. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) independently and solely predictive of log-transformed leptin (rs10487505 [LEP], rs780093 [GCKR], rs900400 [CCNL1], rs6071166 [SLC32A1], and rs6738627 [COBLL1]) and of sOB-R (rs1137101 [LEPR], rs2767485 [LEPR], and rs1751492 [LEPR]) levels (ng/mL) were obtained from 2 previously reported genome-wide association studies. We obtained associations of leptin and sOB-R levels with AD using inverse variance weighting with fixed effects by combining Wald estimates for each SNP. Sensitivity analyses included using weighted median and MR-Egger methods and repeating the analyses using only SNPs of genome-wide significance. Using inverse variance weighting, genetically predicted circulating leptin levels were not associated with AD, albeit with wide confidence intervals (CIs): odds ratio (OR) 0.99 per log-transformed ng/mL; 95% CI 0.55-1.78. Similarly, the association of sOB-R with AD was null using inverse variance weighting (OR 1.08 per log-transformed ng/mL; 95% CI 0.83-1.41). Results from our sensitivity analyses confirmed our findings. In this first Mendelian randomization study estimating the causal effect of leptin on AD, we did not find an effect of genetically predicted circulating leptin and sOB-R levels on AD. As such, this study suggests that leptin is unlikely to be a major contributor to AD, although the wide CIs preclude a definitive assessment.",

    "abstract": "Despite numerous studies on cardioprotective effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), there is limited evidence for n-3 PUFA-mediated effects, especially at its higher dose, on cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes (DM2) and established atherosclerosis. To investigate the effect of daily treatment with a higher dose (2&#xa0;g) of n-3 PUFAs on platelet function, coagulation parameters, fibrin clot properties, markers of systemic inflammation and metabolic status, in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease and DM2 who receive optimal medical therapy. We conducted a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-center study, in which thrombin generation (plasma thrombogenic potential from automated thrombogram), fibrin clot properties (plasma fibrin clot permeability; lysis time), platelet aggregation (light transmission aggregometry with adenosine diphosphate and arachidonic acid used as agonists), HbA1c, insulin level, lipid profiles, leptin and adiponectin levels, as well as markers of systemic inflammation (i.e., hsCRP, IL-6, TNF-&#x3b1;, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and myeloperoxidase) were determined at baseline and at 3&#xa0;months after treatment with 2&#xa0;g/day of n-3 PUFAs (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;36) or placebo (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;38). Moreover, we assessed serum fatty acids of the phospholipid fraction by gas chromatography both at baseline and at the end of the study. Majority of patients were treated with optimal medical therapy and achieved recommended treatment targets. Despite higher serum levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (by 204%; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (by 62%; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.0001) in n-3 PUFA group at the end of treatment no changes in platelet aggregation, thrombin generation, fibrin clot properties or markers of systemic inflammation were observed. No intergroup differences in the insulin, HbA1c and lipid levels were found at the end of the study. There was no change in adiponectin and leptin in interventional group, however leptin increased in control group (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.01), therefore after study period leptin levels were lower in the interventional group (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.01). Additionally, resolvin D1 did not differ between interventional and control group. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that in patients with long-standing, well-controlled DM2 and atherosclerotic disease the treatment with a high dose of n-3 PUFAs (namely, 1&#xa0;g/day of EPA and 1&#xa0;g/day of DHA for 3&#xa0;months) does not improve coagulation, metabolic, and inflammatory status when measured with the specified tests.

Significant differences in the distributions of allele frequency with CRC risk were directly present in ADIPOQ variants rs2241766, rs1501299 and ADIPOR variant rs1342387. In stratified analysis for different populations, significant differences were present in ADIPOQ variant rs822396 for Ashkenazi Jewish, in ADIPOQ variant rs1501299 and ADIPOR variant rs1342387 for Chinese and in ADIPOQ variant rs 2241766 for Ashkenazi Jewish and Chinese. In addition, the factors correlated with insulin resistance had synergistic effect with ADIPOQ variants rs2241766 T/G and rs1501299 G/T on risk of CRC. ADIPOQ variants rs2241766 T/G, rs1501299 G/T and ADIPOR variant ADIPOR rs1342387 G/A had a population specific correlation with CRC risk, which may be mediated by insulin resistance. And large well-designed studies are still needed for further evaluation of rs822396 and rs1063538, especially for their interaction and combined effect in the correlation with CRC risk.",

    "abstract": "Effects of simvastatin on serum level of adiponectin, a protein conferring benefits in both cardiovascular and metabolic system, are not fully determined. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was performed. Studies were identified by searching of Pubmed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases. Heterogeneity among the RCTs was determined by Cochrane's Q test and I<sup>2</sup> statistics. Meta-analysis was performed with random-effect model or fixed-effect model according to the heterogeneity. Meta-regression and subgroup analyses were performed to analyze the source of heterogeneity. Twelve RCTs with 16 comparisons and 1042 patients were included. Overall, serum adiponectin was not significantly affected by simvastatin (WMD: 0.42&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/mL; 95% CI, -0.66-1.50&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/mL). However, significant heterogeneity was detected (Cochrane's Q test: p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01; I<sup>2</sup>&#x2009;=&#x2009;83%). Subsequent meta-regression analyses indicated that treatment duration was a significant determinant of the effects of simvastatin treatment on serum adiponectin (Coefficient 0.04, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03). Subgroup analyses demonstrated that simvastatin treatment was associated with increased adiponectin in studies with treatment duration of 12 weeks (WMD: 3.65&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/mL; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01), but not in studies with treatment duration of&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;8 weeks (WMD: -0.20&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/mL; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.38). The different between the two stratums was significant (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01).

    "abstract": "Low circulating levels of adiponectin, an anti-inflammatory and vasculoprotective adipokine, are associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, and atherosclerotic disease. Presence of unstable plaques in the carotid artery is a known etiological factor causing ischemic strokes. Herein, we systematically reviewed the association between circulating adiponectin and progression of carotid atherosclerotic disease, particularly evaluating the occurrence of (1) carotid atherosclerotic plaques, (2) ischemic stroke, and (3) mortality in subjects who suffered a previous ischemic stroke. Medline, Embase, Biosis, Scopus, Web of Science, and Pubmed were searched for published studies and conference abstracts. The effect size and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the individual studies were pooled using fixed-effect or random-effect models. The quality of the eligible studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale. Sensitivity, subgroup, and meta-regression analyses were performed to address the impact of various risk factors on the association between adiponectin and ischemic stroke risk. Twelve studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria for 3 independent meta-analyses. The association of increasing circulating adiponectin levels (5&#x3bc;g/mL-increment) with presence of carotid plaque was not conclusive (n=327; OR: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.85-1.35; 2 studies), whereas high adiponectin levels showed a significant 8% increase in risk of ischemic stroke (n=13,683; 7 studies), with a more sizable association observed among men compared to women. HDL was observed to have a marginal effect on the association between adiponectin and ischemic stroke, while other evaluated parameters were not found to be effect modifiers. A non-significant association of adiponectin with mortality was yielded (n=663; OR: 2.58; 95% CI: 0.69-9.62; 3 studies). Although no publication bias was evident, there was significant between-study heterogeneity in most analyses. It appears that the direction of the relationship between adiponectin and carotid atherosclerotic plaque presence is dependent on the duration, severity, and nature of the underlying disease, while increased adiponectin levels were associated with an increase in risk for ischemic stroke. Lastly, the results from the mortality meta-analysis remain inconclusive. Future properly designed studies are necessary to further elucidate the role of adiponectin on atherosclerotic plaque development, and its related outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Although high leptin concentration has been shown to be correlated with established vascular risk factors, epidemiologic studies have reported inconclusive results on the association between leptin and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Therefore, a meta-analysis was performed to evaluate this issue. We searched Pubmed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from their inception to Jan 2016 for both case-control and cohort studies that assessed leptin concentration and CVD risk. Reports with odds ratio (OR), risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were considered. The data were extracted by two investigators independently. A total of 13 epidemiologic studies totaling 4257 CVD patients and 26710 controls were included. A significant inverse association was shown between leptin and coronary heart disease (CHD), with an overall OR of 1.16 (95% CI: 1.02-1.32), but not for stroke (OR = 1.21, 95% CI 0.98-1.48) under sociodemographic adjustment. Further adjustment for additional cardiovascular risk factors resulted in ORs of 1.16 (95% CI 0.97-1.40) for CHD and 1.10 (95% CI 0.89-1.35) for stroke. The findings remained when analyses were restricted to high-quality studies and indicated OR estimates of 1.07 (95% CI 0.96-1.19) for CHD and 0.98 (95% CI 0.76-1.25) for stroke. In a subgroup meta-analysis, a high leptin level was not independently associated with CHD in both females (OR = 1.03, 95% CI 0.86-1.23) and males (OR = 1.09, 95% CI 0.95-1.26) or with stroke in both females (OR = 1.13, 95% CI 0.87-1.47) and males (OR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.59-1.09). There was no significant publication bias as suggested by Egger test outcomes. Our findings indicate that high leptin levels may not be associated with risks of CHD and stroke. Further large, well-designed prospective cohort studies are needed to fully evaluate the role of leptin on the risk of CVD.",

    "abstract": "Obesity and headache are two highly prevalent diseases both in adults and children and they are associated with a strong personal and social impact. Many studies suggest that obesity is comorbid with headache in general, and migraine in particular and obesity seems to be a risk factor for migraine progression and for migraine frequency both in adults and in children. Research shows that there are multiple areas of overlap between migraine pathophysiology and the central and peripheral pathways regulating feeding: inflammatory mediators such as the calcitonin gene-related protein (CGRP), neurotransmitters such as serotonin, peptides such as orexin and adipocytokines such as adiponectin (ADP) and leptin could explain the common pathogenesis. In this paper we discussed the association between obesity and migraine through the analysis of the most recent studies in children and we reviewed data from literature in order to assess the association between obesity and headache and to clarify the possible common pathogenic mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that modulate the cellular transcriptome at the post-transcriptional level. miRNA plays important roles in different disease manifestation, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Many studies have characterized the changes of miRNAs in T2DM, a complex systematic disease; however, few studies have integrated these findings and explored the functional effects of the dysregulated miRNAs identified. To investigate the involvement of miRNAs in T2DM, we obtained and analyzed all relevant studies published prior to 18 October 2016 from various literature databases. From 59 independent studies that met the inclusion criteria, we identified 158 dysregulated miRNAs in seven different major sample types. To understand the functional impact of these deregulated miRNAs, we performed targets prediction and pathway enrichment analysis. Results from our analysis suggested that the altered miRNAs are involved in the core processes associated with T2DM, such as carbohydrate and lipid metabolisms, insulin signaling pathway and the adipocytokine signaling pathway. This systematic survey of dysregulated miRNAs provides molecular insights on the effect of deregulated miRNAs in different tissues during the development of diabetes. Some of these miRNAs and their mRNA targets may have diagnostic and/or therapeutic utilities in T2DM.",

    "abstract": "High-amylose maize resistant starch type 2 (HAM-RS2) stimulates gut-derived satiety peptides and reduces adiposity in animals. Human studies have not supported these findings despite improvements in glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity after HAM-RS2 intake which can lower adiposity-related disease risk. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of HAM-RS2 consumption on blood glucose homeostasis in overweight, healthy adults. We also examined changes in biomarkers of satiety (glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1], peptide YY [PYY], and leptin) and body composition determined by anthropometrics and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, dietary intake, and subjective satiety measured by a visual analogue scale following HAM-RS2 consumption. Using a randomized-controlled, parallel-arm, double-blind design, 18 overweight, healthy adults consumed either muffins enriched with 30&#xa0;g HAM-RS2 (n = 11) or 0&#xa0;g HAM-RS2 (control; n =&#x2009;7) daily for 6 weeks. The HAM-RS2 and control muffins were similar in total calories and available carbohydrate. At baseline, total PYY concentrations were significantly higher 120&#xa0;min following the consumption of study muffins in the HAM-RS2 group than control group (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.043). Within the HAM-RS2 group, the area under the curve (AUC) glucose (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.028), AUC leptin (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.022), and postprandial 120-min leptin (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.028) decreased independent of changes in body composition or overall energy intake at the end of 6&#xa0;weeks. Fasting total PYY increased (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.033) in the HAM-RS2 group, but changes in insulin or total GLP-1 were not observed. Mean overall change in subjective satiety score did not correlate with mean AUC biomarker changes suggesting the satiety peptides did not elicit a satiation response or change in overall total caloric intake. The metabolic response from HAM-RS2 occurred despite the habitual intake of a moderate-to-high-fat diet (mean range 34.5% to 39.4% of total calories). Consuming 30&#xa0;g HAM-RS2 daily for 6 weeks can improve glucose homeostasis, lower leptin concentrations, and increase fasting PYY in healthy overweight adults without impacting body composition and may aid in the prevention of chronic disease. However, between-group differences in biomarkers were not observed and future research is warranted before specific recommendations can be made. None.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between circulating adiponectin and visfatin levels and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to establish a correlation between serum adipokine levels and RA activity. We conducted meta-analyses on serum/plasma adiponectin or visfatin levels in patients with RA and controls and correlation coefficients between circulating adiponectin and visfatin levels and Disease Activity Score of 28 joints (DAS28) in RA patients. Eleven studies comprising 813 RA patients and 684 controls were included in this meta-analysis. The meta-analysis revealed that adiponectin levels were significantly higher in the RA group than in the control group (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 1.529, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.354-2.704, P = 0.011). Circulating adiponectin level was not associated with RA activity based on DAS28 and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Visfatin levels were significantly higher in the RA group than in the control group (SMD = 2.575, 95% CI: = 0.963-4.189, P = 0.002).

Our meta-analysis demonstrated that circulating adiponectin levels were significantly higher in patients with RA than in controls. Circulating visfatin levels were significantly higher in patients with RA than in controls and a positive correlation between circulating visfatin level and RA activity is suggested.",

A systematic review was performed, followed by a bibliographic search in PubMed, Medline, SCOPUS, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases. Quantitative data synthesis was performed using a fixed- or random-effects model (based on the level of interstudy heterogeneity) and the generic inverse variance weighting method. Effect sizes were expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Meta-analysis of 23 controlled trials did not suggest any significant effect of adding ezetimibe on top of statin therapy on plasma concentrations of adiponectin (SMD 0.34, 95% CI -0.28, 0.96; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.288), leptin (SMD -0.75, 95% CI: -2.35, 0.85; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.360), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (SMD -1.06, 95% CI: -2.81, 0.69; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.236) and interleukin 6 (SMD 0.30, 95% CI: -0.08, 0.67; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.124). However, significantly greater reductions in plasma concentrations of tumour necrosis factor &#x3b1; (TNF-&#x3b1;) (SMD -0.48, 95% CI -0.87, -0.08; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.018) were achieved with ezetimibe/statin combination therapy. The results suggested that ezetimibe add-on to statin therapy is associated with an enhanced TNF-&#x3b1;-lowering effect compared with statin monotherapy. Owing to the emerging role of TNF-&#x3b1; in the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders, further investigations are required to unveil the translational relevance of this TNF-&#x3b1;-lowering effect.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the effect of sitagliptin vs placebo on histologic and non-histologic parameters of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Twelve patients with biopsy-proven NASH were randomized to sitagliptin (100 mg daily) (n = 6) or placebo (n = 6) for 24 wk. The primary outcome was improvement in liver fibrosis after 24 wk. Secondary outcomes included evaluation of changes in NAFLD activity score (NAS), individual components of NAS (hepatocyte ballooning, lobular inflammation, and steatosis), glycemic control and insulin resistance [including measurements of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) and adipocytokines], lipid profile including free fatty acids, adipose distribution measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and thrombosis markers (platelet aggregation and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 levels). We also sought to determine the correlation between changes in hepatic fat fraction (%) [as measured using the Iterative Decomposition of water and fat with Echo Asymmetry and Least-squares estimation (IDEAL) MRI technique] and changes in hepatic steatosis on liver biopsy. Sitagliptin was not significantly better than placebo at reducing liver fibrosis score as measured on liver biopsy (mean difference between sitagliptin and placebo arms, 0.40, P = 0.82). There were no significant improvements evident with the use of sitagliptin vs placebo for the secondary histologic outcomes of NAS total score as well as for the individual components of NAS. Compared to baseline, those patients who received sitagliptin demonstrated improved HbA1C (6.7% &#xb1; 0.4% vs 7.9% &#xb1; 1.0%, P = 0.02), and trended towards improved adiponectin levels (4.7 &#xb1; 3.5 &#x3bc;g/mL vs 3.9 &#xb1; 2.7 &#x3bc;g/mL, P = 0.06) and triglyceride levels (1.26 &#xb1; 0.43 mmol/L vs 2.80 &#xb1; 1.64 mmol/L, P = 0.08). However, when compared with placebo, sitagliptin did not cause a statistically significant improvement in HbA1C (mean difference, -0.7%, P = 0.19) nor triglyceride levels (mean difference -1.10 mmol/L, P = 0.19) but did trend towards improved adiponectin levels only (mean difference, 0.60 &#x3bc;g/mL, P = 0.095). No significant changes in anthropometrics, liver enzymes, other adipocytokines, lipid profile, thrombosis parameters, or adipose distribution were demonstrated. The MRI IDEAL procedure correlated well with steatosis scores obtained on liver biopsy in both groups at baseline and post-treatment, and the Spearman correlation coefficients ranged from r = 0.819 (baseline) to r = 0.878 (post-treatment), P = 0.002. Sitagliptin does not improve fibrosis score or NAS after 24 wk of therapy. The MRI IDEAL technique may be useful for non-invasive measurement of hepatic steatosis.",

    "abstract": "Offspring of obese mothers have increased risk of developing obesity and related short- and long-term disease. The cause is multifactorial and may partly be explained by the unfavorable intrauterine environment. Intervention during pregnancy leading to a healthier lifestyle among obese may alter this. To assess the effect of lifestyle intervention on markers of maternal metabolism and inflammation in 'the TOP (Treatment of Obese Pregnant Women) study', a randomized controlled trial. In the TOP-study 425 participants with body mass index &#x2a7e;30&#x2009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> were randomized to intervention with dietary advices and physical activity assessed by pedometer (PA+D), physical activity assessed by pedometer (PA) or control (C). Of 389 participants completing the study 376 had available blood samples. Serum was analyzed for insulin, c-peptide, lipid profile, leptin, high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) and Soluble urokinase Plasminogen Activator Receptor (suPAR), in week 18-20 and 28-30, and simultaneously a 2-h oral glucose-tolerance-test was performed. Diet was assessed in gestational week 11-14 and 36-37 using a validated 360-item Food Frequency Questionnaire. Median levels of hsCRP in gestational week 28-30 were lower in each of the intervention groups (8.3&#x2009;mg/l in PA+D group, P=0.03; and 8.8&#x2009;mg/l in PA group, P=0.02) versus the control group (11.5&#x2009;mg/l). Obtaining 11&#x2009;000 steps per day as aimed for resulted in a 21% lower hsCRP compared to non-compliant women. Women reporting high carbohydrate intake had around 30% higher hsCRP concentrations in late gestation than women reporting the lowest intake. There were no differences in lipid profile or any of the metabolic markers in gestational week 28-30 when comparing the intervention and control groups. Lifestyle intervention in obese women can reduce hsCRP representing a marker of inflammation during pregnancy. The effect may partly be mediated by more physical activity and partly by changes in intake of carbohydrates and the glycaemic load.",

    "abstract": "Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) plays a role in cardiac physiology and may contribute to the development of coronary artery disease. Our objective was to determine whether there was a significant difference in gene expression in EAT compared to subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and to identify potential relationships. MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched using the key terms Epicardial Adipose Tissue or Epicardial Fat in combination with RNA, mRNA, or gene. The entry criteria were studies that presented primary data including expression levels of mRNA in human EAT compared with SAT and an expression of variance (SD). Genes identified by 2 or more studies were evaluated. Genes that showed significant change in expression between EAT and SAT were examined using the Gene Functional Classification analytical tool in Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery and cross-validated by ToppGene. Seventeen genes were identified from 25 studies. Meta-analysis showed that 10 genes (ADORA1, adiponectin, AGT, ADM, CATA, IL-1&#x3b2;, MCP-1, RBP-4, TNF-&#x3b1;, UCP-1) were significantly different in EAT. Gene Functional Classification analysis yielded 23 clusters with significant relationships. The top clusters were focused on responses to glucocorticoid stimulus, regulation of apoptosis, cellular ion homeostasis, and responses to hormone stimulus. Genetic analysis shows that EAT is discretely different from SAT. ADORA1, adiponectin, AGT, ADM, CATA, IL-1&#x3b2;, MCP-1, RBP-4, TNF-&#x3b1;, and UCP-1 may play significant roles in the unique physiology of EAT and/or its role in pathophysiology, through mechanisms as diverse as steroid hormone responses and regulation of apoptosis.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate leptin and adiponectin as markers of undernutrition in cancer patients, and compare their performances with those of other biomarkers. This was a prospective and observational study of 132 patients with various types of cancer. Following the recommended professional criteria, we diagnosed undernutrition at the time of blood sampling for the biological analysis of leptin, adiponectin, paraoxonase (hydrolysis rate of three substrates: paraoxon (PON), phenylacetate (ARE) and thiolactone (LAC)), and the calculation of the Prognostic Inflammatory and Nutritional Index (PINI). Patients were monitored for one year to establish the mortality rate of the group. Relationships between biological variables and undernutrition were evaluated using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. The Kaplan Meier method was used to analyse survival curves. Hazard ratios for death were calculated according to the quartiles of each biological variable. In the case of undernutrition, a decrease was observed in levels of leptin and in the lactonase activity (LAC) of paraoxonase, while adiponectin levels increased. Besides PINI, leptin was the only parameter that was independently related to undernutrition. While no relation was found between survival and leptin or adiponectin levels, evidence was found that PINI, LAC and ARE were associated with survival, even in multivariate analysis. Leptin and PINI are good markers of installed undernutrition, and PINI and ARE or LAC are reliable markers of the risk of death in patients suffering from cancer.",

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-mo clinical trial, we randomized 80 individuals of both sexes (mean age 52&#xa0;y) with at least one cardiovascular risk factor (excess weight, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, or smoking) into two groups: &#x3c9;-3 (supplemented with 3&#xa0;g/d of fish oil containing 37% eicosapentaenoic acid and 23% docosahexaenoic acid) and placebo (3&#xa0;g/d of sunflower oil containing 65% linoleic acid). At baseline and after the intervention, we evaluated serum adiponectin, leptin, lipid profile, apolipoproteins (apo), electronegative low-density lipoprotein (LDL[-]), and glucose metabolism (glucose and insulin). After supplementation, the &#x3c9;-3 group showed an increase in serum adiponectin. After stratifying the &#x3c9;-3 group by adiponectin concentration at baseline, participants with lower adiponectin concentration showed a higher reduction of total cholesterol, LDL, LDL/high-density lipoprotein ratio, LDL/apo B, and LDL(-). Individuals with a higher variation of adiponectin concentration after &#x3c9;-3 supplementation presented with reduced blood glucose. The variation of serum adiponectin induced by &#x3c9;-3 supplementation was negatively correlated with the Framingham and Adult Treatment Panel IV scores (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.4 and P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05 for both). Adiponectin is shown as one of the mechanisms by which &#x3c9;-3 improves cardiometabolic profile in persons with cardiovascular risk. Moreover, the benefit varies according to the adiponectin basal level and adiponectin variation after supplementation.",

    "abstract": "The study is aimed at elucidating the relationship between the blood b-endorphin level in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) with metabolic syndrome (MS) and cardiovascular risk factors and evaluating the possibility to correct them by dalargin therapy. The study included 123 patients (61 men and 62 women) at the mean age 57.6&#xb1;5,2 years randomized into 2 groups. The patients of group 1 (n=63) were given the standard treatment, those of group 2 (n=60) additionally received 2 mg/day of dalargin for 10 days (3 courses during 3 months). The group of comparison (n=84) contained 84 CHD patients without MS. Biochemical and immunological characteristics were measured by immuno enzyme and immunochemiluminescent assays before and 3 months after treatment. The study revealed inverse correlation between b-endorphin levels and those of leptin, insulin, cortisol, TNF-a, IL-6, oxidized LDLP, triglycerides (TG), and HDLP cholesterol. Standard therapy resulted in a 6.5% reduction of insulin level, 9,4% , 6,1%, and 17,4% reduction of TNF-a , IL-6, TG levels respectively; it increased the HDLP cholesterol level by 10,3% (p&lt;0,05 for all values) but did not change other parameters of interest. Dalargin therapy caused a 32,6% and 17,4%, rise in the b-endorphin and HDLP cholesterol levels but decreased leptin, insulin, cortisol, TNF-a, IL-6, LDLP, and tG levels by 36,1%, 22,4%, 23,9%, 55%, 56,3%, 14% and 27,2% respectively (p&lt;0,001). It is concluded that the decrease of the blood b-endorphin level in the patients with coronary heart disease and metabolic syndrome is associated with enhanced blood atherogenicity, hyperinsulinemia, hypercortisolemia, activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and lipid peroxidation. Supplementation of conventional therapy with dalargin results in the increased b-endorphin level, enhanced anti-atherogenic effect, reduced activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines and lipid peroxidation, reduction of leptin, insulin and cortisol levels.",

    "abstract": "Low-grade inflammation is involved in the development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Inflammation can be modulated by dietary factors. Dairy products are rich in saturated fatty acids (SFA), which are known to possess pro-inflammatory properties. However, different fatty acid compositions may exert different effects. Other components such as milk proteins may exert anti-inflammatory properties which may compensate for the potential negative effects of SFAs. Generally, the available data suggest a neutral role of dairy product consumption on inflammation. To investigate the effects of, and potential interaction between, a dietary supplementation with whey protein and milk fat, naturally enriched in medium-chain SFA (MC-SFA), on inflammatory markers in abdominal obese adults. The study was a 12-week, randomized, double-blinded, intervention study. Sixty-three adults were equally allocated to one of four groups which received a supplement of either 60 g/day whey or 60 g/day casein plus 63 g/day milk fat either high or low in MC-SFA content. Fifty-two subjects completed the study. Before and after the intervention, changes in plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), adiponectin, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were measured. Changes in inflammatory genes in the subcutaneous adipose tissue were also documented. There were no differences in circulating inflammatory markers between protein types or fatty acid compositions in abdominally obese subjects, with the exception of an increase in adiponectin in response to high compared to low MC-SFA consumption in women. We found that combined dairy proteins and MC-SFAs influenced inflammatory gene expression in adipose tissue, while no effect was detected by dairy proteins or MC-SFA per se. Whey protein compared with casein and MC-SFA-enriched milk fat did not alter circulating markers of low-grade inflammation in abdominally obese subjects, except for an increase in circulating adiponectin in response to high MC-SFA in abdominally obese women.",

    "abstract": "In developing countries the rise of obesity and obesity-related metabolic disorders, such as cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes, reflects the changes in lifestyle habits and wrong dietary choices. Dietary restriction (DR) regimens have been shown to extend health span and lifespan in many animal models including primates. Identifying biomarkers predictive of clinical benefits of treatment is one of the primary goals of precision medicine. To monitor the clinical outcomes of DR interventions in humans, several biomarkers are commonly adopted. However, a validated link between the behaviors of such biomarkers and DR effects is lacking at present time. Through a systematic analysis of human intervention studies, we evaluated the effect size of DR (i.e. calorie restriction, very low calorie diet, intermittent fasting, alternate day fasting) on health-related biomarkers. We found that DR is effective in reducing total and visceral adipose mass and improving inflammatory cytokines profile and adiponectin/leptin ratio. By analysing the levels of canonical biomarkers of healthy aging, we also validated the changes of insulin, IGF-1 and IGFBP-1,2 to monitor DR effects. Collectively, we developed a useful platform to evaluate the human responses to dietary regimens low in calories.",

    "abstract": "Adipokines are mediators released from adipose tissue. These proteins are regarded as active elements of systemic and pulmonary inflammation, whose dysregulation can alter an individual's risk of developing allergic lung diseases. Despite this knowledge, adipokine responses to inhaled stimuli are poorly understood. We sought to measure serum and lung adiponectin, leptin, and resistin in an atopic adult study population following exposure to allergen and diesel exhaust (DE). Two types of lung samples including bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and bronchial wash (BW), and a time course of serum samples, were collected from the 18 subjects who participated in the randomized, double-blinded controlled human study. The two crossover exposure triads in this study were inhaled DE and filtered air each followed by instilled allergen or saline. Serum and lung adipokine responses to these exposures were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Allergen significantly increased adiponectin and leptin in BAL, and adiponectin in the BW 48&#xa0;hours after exposure. Serum leptin and resistin responses were not differentially affected by exposure, but varied over time. Coexposure with DE and allergen revealed significant correlations between the adiponectin/leptin ratio and FEV1 changes and airway responsiveness measures. Changes in lung and serum adipokines in response to allergen exposure were identified in the context of a controlled exposure study. Coexposure identified a potentially protective role of adiponectin in the lung. This response was not observed in those with baseline airway hyper-responsiveness, or after allergen exposure alone. The clinical relevance of this potentially adaptive adipokine pattern warrants further study.",

    "title": "Impact of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors on serum adiponectin: a meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin, an adipose-specific protein, is negatively correlated with pro-atherogenic low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and other cardiovascular risk factors such as insulin resistance. Therefore, low levels of adiponectin are associated with a higher risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) have been used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as reversible inhibitors through interacting with DPP4 substrate and increase serum incretins such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of DPP4i on serum adiponectin in T2DM patients. The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library databases were searched from inception to February 2016. Randomized controlled trials, evaluating the DPP4i (sitagliptin and vildagliptin) versus comparator (placebo or active-comparison), in T2DM patients with duration of&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;12&#xa0;weeks, were identified. Weighted differences in means of adiponectin levels were calculated by using a fixed or random-effects model. Ten randomized controlled trials, including 1,495 subjects, were identified. Compared with placebo, DPP4i (sitagliptin and vildagliptin) treatment significantly elevated adiponectin levels by 0.74&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/mL (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45 to 1.03) relative to that using an active-comparison by 0.00&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/mL (95% CI, -0.57 to 0.56). Compared with active-comparison, vildagliptin treatment increased adiponectin levels by 0.32&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/mL (95% CI, -0.01 to 0.65), whereas sitagliptin treatment decreased adiponectin levels by -0.24&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/mL (95% CI, -1.07 to 0.58). Trials examining effects of other DPP4i were not found. Sitagliptin and vildagliptin increased serum adiponectin levels and had no stronger effect than traditional oral antidiabetic drugs. Further trials with larger sample size are needed to confirm the results and investigate the association between serum adiponectin levels and treatment of other DPP-4 inhibitors.

    "title": "Effect of OSA on hypoxic and inflammatory markers during CPAP withdrawal: Further evidence from three randomized control trials.",
    "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is associated with cardiovascular disease. Intermittent hypoxia, endothelial dysfunction and adipose tissue-mediated inflammation have all been linked to cardiovascular disease in OSA. We therefore explored the effect of OSA on relevant associated blood markers: adrenomedullin (ADM), endocan, endothelin-1 (ET-1), resistin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Patients with OSA, established on and compliant with continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) therapy for &gt;1&#x2009;year were included from three randomized controlled trials, conducted at two centres. Patients were randomized to either continued therapeutic CPAP or sham CPAP (CPAP withdrawal) for 2 weeks. Blood markers were measured at baseline and at 14 days and the treatment effect between sham CPAP and therapeutic CPAP was analysed. A total of 109 patients were studied (therapeutic CPAP n&#x2009;=&#x2009;54, sham CPAP n&#x2009;=&#x2009;55). Sham CPAP was associated with a return of OSA (between-group difference in oxygen desaturation index (ODI) 36.0/h, 95% CI 29.9-42.2, P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Sham CPAP was associated with a reduction in ADM levels at 14 days (-26.0&#x2009;pg/mL, 95% CI -47.8 to -4.3, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02), compared to therapeutic CPAP. Return of OSA was not associated with changes in endocan, ET-1, resistin or VEGF. Whilst CPAP withdrawal was associated with return of OSA, it was associated with an unexpected significant reduction in the vasodilator ADM and not with expected increases in hypoxia-induced markers, markers of endothelial function or resistin. We propose that the vascular effects occurring in OSA may be brought about by other mechanisms, perhaps partly through a reduction in ADM.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin plays key roles in regulating appetite and food intake. To investigate interactions between the genetic risk score (GRS) for adiponectin levels and weight-loss diets varying in macronutrient intake on long-term changes in appetite and adiponectin levels. A GRS was calculated based on 5 adiponectin-associated variants in 692 overweight adults from the 2-year Preventing Overweight Using Novel Dietary Strategies trial. Repeated measurements of plasma adiponectin levels and appetite-related traits, including cravings, fullness, prospective consumption, and hunger. Dietary fat showed nominally significant interactions with the adiponectin GRS on changes in appetite score and prospective consumption from baseline to 6 months (P for interaction = 0.014 and 0.017, respectively) after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, baseline body mass index, and baseline respective outcome values. The GRS for lower adiponectin levels was associated with a greater decrease in appetite (P &lt; 0.001) and prospective consumption (P = 0.008) among participants consuming a high-fat diet, whereas no significant associations were observed in the low-fat group. Additionally, a significant interaction was observed between the GRS and dietary fat on 6-month changes in adiponectin levels (P for interaction = 0.021). The lower GRS was associated with a greater increase in adiponectin in the low-fat group (P = 0.02), but it was not associated with adiponectin changes in the high-fat group (P = 0.31). Our findings suggest that individuals with varying genetic architecture of circulating adiponectin may respond divergently in appetite and adiponectin levels to weight-loss diets varying in fat intake.",

    "abstract": "Conflicting results regarding leptin levels in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have been reported. We summarize all available evidence from human participant studies to evaluate leptin levels in PCOS. PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov , and Web of Science databases were searched with English-language restriction for only human beings from the inception to December 31, 2015. Search terms included PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome or PCOS) and leptin. A total of 238 studies were reviewed, and a total of 19 studies, involving 991 women with PCOS and 898 controls, were eligible for our meta-analysis. Studies were eligible if provided leptin means and standard deviation in women with PCOS and healthy women controls. Parameters, such as body mass index, insulin resistance (IR), and total testosterone, which may influence leptin levels were extracted. Data were collected and analyzed by RevMan 5.3 and Stata/SE14.0. The pooling analysis of all relevant studies revealed that leptin levels were significantly higher in patients with PCOS than in controls, with standardized mean difference of 1.62 (95% confidence interval: 1.01-2.23). However, the heterogeneity across studies was considerable and not eliminated in subgroup analyses. Meta-regression analysis further suggested that the heterogeneity might be relevant to variability in IR and study location. Elevated leptin levels are detected in women with PCOS compared with non-PCOS controls. Higher leptin levels may be correlated with IR, metabolic disorder, infertility, and even cardiovascular disease risk in PCOS, which may contribute to the etiology and development of PCOS.",

The present study aimed to clarify the role of genetic variants in leptin, adiponectin and their receptors in prostate cancer.

From the pooled-review, we additionally recognized eight variants associated with cancer risk and another eight variants associated with cancer aggressiveness, respectively. These observations indicated important roles of leptin, adiponectin and their receptors in the development and progression of prostate cancer.

    "title": "Isocaloric Diets High in Animal or Plant Protein Reduce Liver Fat and Inflammation in Individuals With Type 2 Diabetes.",
    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with increased risk of hepatic, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases. High-protein diets, rich in methionine and branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), apparently reduce liver fat, but can induce insulin resistance. We investigated the effects of diets high in animal protein (AP) vs plant protein (PP), which differ in levels of methionine and BCAAs, in patients with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD. We examined levels of liver fat, lipogenic indices, markers of inflammation, serum levels of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), and activation of signaling pathways in adipose tissue. We performed a prospective study of individuals with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD at a tertiary medical center in Germany from June 2013 through March 2015. We analyzed data from 37 subjects placed on a diet high in AP (rich in meat and dairy foods; n&#xa0;= 18) or PP (mainly legume protein; n&#xa0;= 19) without calorie restriction for 6 weeks. The diets were isocaloric with the same macronutrient composition (30% protein, 40% carbohydrates, and 30% fat). Participants were examined at the start of the study and after the 6-week diet period for body mass index, body composition, hip circumference, resting energy expenditure, and respiratory quotient. Body fat and intrahepatic fat were detected by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy, respectively. Levels of glucose, insulin, liver enzymes, and inflammation markers, as well as individual free fatty acids and free amino acids, were measured in collected blood samples. Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps were performed to determine whole-body insulin sensitivity. Subcutaneous adipose tissue samples were collected and analyzed for gene expression patterns and phosphorylation of signaling proteins. Postprandial levels of BCAAs and methionine were significantly higher in subjects on the AP vs the PP diet. The AP and PP diets each reduced liver fat by 36%-48% within 6 weeks (for AP diet P&#xa0;= .0002; for PP diet P&#xa0;= .001). These reductions were unrelated to change in body weight, but correlated with down-regulation of lipolysis and lipogenic indices. Serum level of FGF21 decreased by 50% in each group (for AP diet P &lt; .0002; for PP diet P &lt; .0002); decrease in FGF21 correlated with loss of hepatic fat. In gene expression analyses of adipose tissue, expression of the FGF21 receptor cofactor &#x3b2;-klotho was associated with reduced expression of genes encoding lipolytic and lipogenic proteins. In patients on each diet, levels of hepatic enzymes and markers of inflammation decreased, insulin sensitivity increased, and serum level of keratin 18 decreased. In a prospective study of patients with type 2 diabetes, we found diets high in protein (either animal or plant) significantly reduced liver fat independently of body weight, and reduced markers of insulin resistance and hepatic necroinflammation. The diets appear to mediate these changes via lipolytic and lipogenic pathways in adipose tissue. Negative effects of BCAA or methionine were not detectable. FGF21 level appears to be a marker of metabolic improvement. ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT02402985.",

    "title": "Association between omentin-1, adiponectin and bone health under consideration of osteoprotegerin as possible mediator.",
    "abstract": "Several studies implicated a crosstalk between bone and fat in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. Few studies indicated an association between adiponectin and omentin-1 on the bone remodeling process and bone mineral density, and suggested osteoprotegerin (OPG) as a mediator of this relationship. However, only limited evidence on this relationship is available in humans. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the association between omentin-1, adiponectin and broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) in peri-/premenopausal and postmenopausal women, and to assess the role of OPG as a possible mediator. Data from the German population-based EPIC-Potsdam cohort comprising 637 women were analyzed. Multivariable-adjusted ANCOVA including age, BMI, waist circumference, smoking status, education, physical activity, adiponectin or omentin-1 and hormone use was used to investigate potential relationships between the adipokines and BUA levels. A mediation analysis assessed the mediating effect of OPG on the association of BUA and omentin-1 levels. Peri-/premenopausal women had higher BUA levels (112.5&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;10.1&#xa0;dB/MHz), compared to postmenopausal women (106.3&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;10.0&#xa0;dB/MHz). In peri-/premenopausal women neither adiponectin nor omentin-1 was significantly associated with BUA. In postmenopausal women, adiponectin was not associated with BUA, but 10&#xa0;% increase in the omentin-1 concentration was significantly associated with 0.44&#xa0;dB/MHz lower BUA levels (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.01). Omentin-1 was positively associated with OPG (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.02); however, OPG was not significantly related to BUA (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.62). Our study provides evidence for an inverse association between circulating omentin-1 and BUA levels in postmenopausal women. However, the present findings do not support a mediating effect of OPG in the adipose tissue-bone pathway.",

    "abstract": "Insulin resistance (IR), a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality, is prevalent among maintenance hemodialysis patients. Effects of omega-3 fatty acids on IR in hemodialysis patients have not been well understood. This study aimed to determine the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on IR and serum lipids of hemodialysis patients. Fifty-four adult patients on hemodialysis were randomly assigned to receive either 1800 mg of omega-3 fatty acids or placebo daily for 4 months. Serum concentrations of glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, C-reactive protein, insulin, leptin, and adiponectin were measured at baseline and after 4 months of the intervention. Insulin resistance was assessed using the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and 2 adipokine-based measures of IR, including the leptin-adiponectin ratio and homeostasis model assessment corrected by adiponectin. Mean differences of serum C-reactive protein, insulin, leptin, and adiponectin concentrations did not show significant difference between the two groups following 4 months of intervention. Fasting serum glucose and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were not significantly influenced by omega-3 supplementation, either. Serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels significantly decreased in the omega-3 group (P = .02, P = .03, and P &lt; .001, respectively).

    "title": "Effect of Sibutramine on Plasma C-Reactive Protein, Leptin and Adipon ectin Concentrations: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Contr olled Trials.",
    "abstract": "Sibutramine is an anti-obesity medication whose effects on weight loss have been widely explored. Moreover, limited number of studies also evidenced its correlates on adipokines and proinflammatory markers; however, their results have not been conclusive. Hence, a systematic review and meta-analysis of available evidence was conducted in order to calculate the effect size of sibutramine therapy on C-reactive protein (CRP), leptin and adiponectin concentrations. Seven randomized clinical trials with a total of 601 subjects met the eligibility criteria. Random effect meta-analysis evidenced a significant decrease in plasma levels of CRP and leptin (weighted mean difference [WMD] -15.58%, 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: -28.84, -2.33, p=0.021 and WMD -9.25, 95%CI: -15.73, -2.78, p=0.005, respectively) and increase of adiponectin (WMD 9.86%, 95%CI: 1.76, 17.96, p=0.017) following sibutramine therapy. Subgroup analysis showed a greater CRP-lowering effect of sibutramine with doses &lt;15 mg/day (WMD -17.26%, 95%CI: -31.02, -3.5, p=0.014) compared with doses .15 mg/day (WMD 6.01%, 95%CI: -43.38, 55.40, p=0.811). In meta-regression analysis, changes in CRP were found to be independent of baseline or percentage change in body mass index. These results suggest a significant improvement of plasma CRP, leptin and adiponectin levels following treatment with sibutramine. Possible impacts and relevance of these alterations on cardiovascular risk profile remain to be clarified, especially in post-hoc analyses of sibutramine outcome trials among people without pre-existing cardiovascular disease.",

    "abstract": "Many epidemiological studies have investigated the correlation between adiponectin, C1Q and collagen domain containing (ADIPOQ) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Although conflicting results have been reported, there was dispute regarding two SNPs (rs2241766 T/G and rs1501299 G/T). Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to systematically assess the associations and try to find the reasons for the dispute. We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Elsevier, Wiley Online Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang data and Chongqing VIP to search for all eligible case-control studies published up to January 2015. Effect sizes of odds ratios (OR) and 95&#xa0;% confidence intervals (95&#xa0;% CI) were calculated using a fixed- or random-effect model. Ten case-control studies including 4377 cases and 5584 controls were selected. A significant difference was observed in Chinese (OR 0.76; 95&#xa0;% CI 0.68, 0.85; P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) and Ashkenazi Jewish populations (OR 0.79; 95&#xa0;% CI 0.63, 0.99; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.04) for rs2241766 with dominant model (TT vs TG&#xa0;+&#xa0;GG). A significant difference was observed in the Chinese population (OR 1.23; 95&#xa0;% CI 1.11, 1.37; P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) for rs1501299 with dominant model (TT vs TG&#xa0;+&#xa0;GG). In addition, intake of red meat showed a synergistic effect between ADIPOQ gene and risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). ADIPOQ SNPs rs2241766 T/G and rs 1501299 G/T have a population-specific correlation with risk of CRC. However, small sample studies may increase reporting bias, particularly if the total number of studies included in the analysis is small.",

    "abstract": "Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) cause weight loss and metabolic improvement, but results of published studies are contradictory. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of SG and RYGB on ghrelin, leptin, and glucose homeostasis in a randomized controlled trial. University hospital, Poland. Seventy-two morbidly obese patients were randomly selected to undergo either SG (n = 36) or RYGB (n = 36). Fasting ghrelin, leptin, glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, glycated hemoglobin, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance were assessed preoperatively and at 1, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. No differences were found in anthropometric and biochemical parameters between the study groups at baseline. Sixty-nine (95.8%) patients completed the study. Percentage of excess weight loss at 12 months was 67.6&#xb1;19.3% after SG and 64.2&#xb1;18.5% after RYGB (P&gt;.05). Fasting ghrelin levels decreased 1 month after SG (from 76.8 pmol/L to 35.3 pmol/L; P&lt;.05) and remained reduced until 12 months (41.6 pmol/L; P&lt;.05) but increased 12 months after RYGB from 74.6 pmol/L to 130.2 pmol/L (P&lt;.05). Leptin, glucose, insulin, and C-peptide concentrations and glycated hemoglobin and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance values decreased significantly in both groups during 12 months. RYGB and SG induce comparable weight loss and improvement in metabolism of glucose. Ghrelin levels decrease after SG and increase after RYGB, but this difference does not affect similar outcomes of these procedures during 1-year follow-up. The contribution of ghrelin to weight loss or metabolic benefits after bariatric surgery is not straightforward, but rather influenced by multiple factors.",

    "abstract": "This study compared the effects of nonlinear resistance training (NRT), aerobic interval training (AIT), and detraining on adipokines and cardiometabolic risk factors in middle-aged obese men. Thirty-three obese men were randomly allocated to NRT (n = 12), AIT (n = 10), and control (CON, n = 11) groups. Subjects in experimental groups performed exercise protocols 3 days per week for 12 weeks followed by a 4-week detraining period. The NRT involved 55 min of weight training with flexible periodization. The AIT consisted of running on a treadmill (4 &#xd7; 4-min intervals at 90% of maximal heart rate, with each interval separated by 3 min at 65%). Peak oxygen consumption increased significantly after training compared with CON (P &lt; 0.01), but it increased more in the AIT group than in the NRT group (P = 0.004). After detraining, peak oxygen consumption decreased significantly in both training groups (P &lt; 0.001); however, the value in the AIT group was still higher than that in the CON group (P = 0.003). No significant changes were observed in serum levels of omentin-1 and interleukin (IL)-18 after training (P &gt; 0.05), but omentin-1 decreased significantly in both training groups and IL-18 increased significantly in the NRT group after detraining (P &lt; 0.05). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) increased significantly after training in the AIT group compared with the CON group (P &lt; 0.05) and returned to the pre-training level after detraining. Conversely, apelin-13 increased significantly in response to training, compared with baseline (P &lt; 0.05), and remained unchanged after detraining. Both training regimens had similar effects on most markers; however, AIT seems to have stronger anti-coronary disease effects (as indicated by HDL-C and peak oxygen consumption) than NRT.",

Systematic searches of relevant studies published up to Dec 2014 and Jan 2016 on the ADIPOQ +45T&gt;G polymorphism and the risk of MS and adiponectin levels and the risk of stroke, respectively, were conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE.

We searched for articles in MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, HuGE Navigator, CNKI, and Wanfang databases and calculated odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to determine the strength of associations in fixed- or random-effects models. We included 21 articles in the meta-analysis: 17 reports of ADIPOQ rs2241766 with 3628 cases and 3000 controls and 8 of rs266729 with 2021 cases and 2226 controls.

Eighty-seven MetS patients were enrolled in a 6month lifestyle intervention program based on dietary management and increased physical activity, and compared with 44 aged and sex-matched healthy controls. MetS individuals were allocated to different groups randomized (computer-generated randomization) on exercise modalities (high-intensity dominant resistance or aerobic training, and moderate-intensity of both modes). EAT was measured by transthoracic echocardiography and LV longitudinal strains and strain rates were obtained using vector velocity imaging. Blood chemistry allowed assessments of adipocytokines (TNF-&#x3b1;: tumor necrosis factor &#x3b1;, PAI active: active plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and adiponectin) and glucose tolerance markers. Regardless of exercise training modalities, lifestyle intervention improved significantly LV strains and strain rates (p&lt;0.001) as well as metabolic and inflammatory profiles. Stepwise multiple regression analyses revealed EAT (&#x3b2;=0.73, p&lt;0.01), log adiponectin (&#x3b2;=-0.13, p&lt;0.05) and log TNF-&#x3b1; (&#x3b2;=0.15, p&lt;0.05) as independent predictors of LV longitudinal strain (R(2)=0.74, p&lt;0.001) while myocardial function improvement consecutive to lifestyle intervention was explained by EAT changes only (R(2)=0.54, p&lt;0.001). The mechanisms through which regional myocardial function is impaired in MetS and improved consecutive to intervention involved EAT, possibly via paracrine effects of adipocytokines. EAT should be considered as a future therapeutic target of interest in the treatment of metabolic-related cardiac diseases.",

    "abstract": "Thiazolidinediones (TZDs; pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) have provided promising results in clinical trials for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The main purpose of this systematic review was to summarize evidence on circulating adiponectin levels in relation to histological changes following TZD treatment in patients with histologically confirmed NASH. We performed a systematic search in PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane Library. We included four studies, published between 2006 and 2012, providing data for 187 histologically confirmed NASH adult patients (105 on TZD and 82 controls) treated for 6-12months. Significant increase in adiponectin (80-178%) after TZD treatment was observed in all included studies. Improvement in steatosis following treatment was observed in all studies. A trend towards improvement in lobular inflammation was observed in all studies after pioglitazone, but not after rosiglitazone. Trends toward improvement in ballooning and fibrosis were observed in the two studies after pioglitazone using either the highest doses or the longest duration of therapy. Overall disease activity score was improved in all studies after pioglitazone, but not after rosiglitazone. Insulin resistance and liver function tests were also improved after treatment. Despite weight gain, circulating leptin was not increased after treatment. In conclusion, parallel increases in circulating adiponectin levels and histological improvement were observed in this systematic review. These results warrant further consideration of TZDs, but even more importantly point to a key role for novel potential treatments for NASH patients such as the newer selective peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-&#x3b3; modulators, which increase adiponectin without significant weight gain.",

    "abstract": "The effect of statin therapy on plasma adiponectin levels has not been conclusively studied. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate this effect through a systematic review and meta-analysis of available randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Quantitative data synthesis was performed using a random-effects model with weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) as summary statistics. In 30 studies (43 study arms) with 2953 participants, a significant increase in plasma adiponectin levels was observed after statin therapy (WMD: 0.57&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/mL, 95% CI: 0.18, 0.95, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.004). In subgroup analysis, atorvastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin and pitavastatin were found to change plasma adiponectin concentrations by 0.70&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/mL (95% CI:&#xa0;-0.26, 1.65), 0.50&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/mL (95% CI:&#xa0;-0.44, 1.45),&#xa0;-0.70&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/mL (95% CI:&#xa0;-1.08,&#xa0;-0.33), 0.62&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/mL (95% CI:&#xa0;-0.12, 1.35), and 0.51&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/mL (95% CI: 0.30, 0.72), respectively.

The meta-analysis showed a significant increase in plasma adiponectin levels following statin therapy. Although statins are known to increase the risk for new onset diabetes mellitus, our data might suggest that the mechanism for this is unlikely to be due to a reduction in adiponectin expression.",

    "abstract": "There has been growing evidence that adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1; (TNF-&#x3b1;) and inflammatory cytokines involved in insulin resistance and may be attractive candidates for assessing risk of the incident type 2 diabetes (T2DM). A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies was conducted to assess the associations of levels of serum adiponectin, TNF-&#x3b1; and inflammatory markers (Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1&#x3b2;), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-18 (IL-18), C-reactive protein (CRP)) with risk of T2DM. We searched PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases up until February 1, 2016 for eligible studies which were matched to search subjects. Either fixed-effects or random-effects models were used to estimate the summary risk incorporated between study variations. 19 studies comprising a total of 39,136 participants and 7924 cases were included in the meta-analysis. Our findings showed that an obvious association of elevated CRP levels with T2DM risk (relative risk [RR] 1.48 [95% CI 1.26-1.71]), with the absence of publication bias. For IL-6, the meta-analysis involved 16 cohorts with a total of 24,929 participants and 4751 cases. Using data from all trials, a strong positive correlation (1.32 [1.14, 1.51]) was observed between basal plasma IL-6 and T2DM, whereas relatively lower relation between TNF-&#x3b1; (1.16 [0.87, 1.45]), IL-18 (1.45 [1.16, 1.73]), IL-1&#x3b2; (0.87, [0.59, 1.15]) and independently increased risk to occurrence of T2DM. Conversely, we also found that the level of adiponectin decreased significantly in patients with T2DM. Sensitivity analyses further supported the associations. This meta-analysis indicates that T2DM risk as whole was strongly associated with elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1&#x3b2;, IL-6, IL-18, CRP), TNF-&#x3b1; and low levels of adiponectin. Despite an overall detectable association in the meta-analysis, considerable heterogeneity existed between studies. Further work is needed, it seems clear that a complex interplay of inflammation and the development of DM. Moreover, these biomarkers are predictors of T2DM subjects and should take more attention to measure levels of these as well as to target therapy/interventions.",

Patients treated with insulin (bolus component &lt;30% of total daily dose) with/without a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor were randomized to receive placebo (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;87) or ipragliflozin (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;175) for 16&#x2009;weeks. The primary endpoint was the change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) from baseline. Secondary endpoints included changes in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and metabolic hormones. Safety endpoints were also examined. The changes in HbA1c were 0.27% and -0.79% (2.9 and -8.7 mmol/mol) in the placebo and ipragliflozin groups, respectively (baseline: 8.62% vs 8.67% [70.8 vs 71.2 mmol/mol]), corresponding to an adjusted mean difference of -1.07% (95% confidence interval -1.24, -0.91) or -11.7 mmol/mol (-13.5, -9.9), p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001.

    "title": "Phase II study of metformin for reduction of obesity-associated breast cancer risk: a randomized controlled trial protocol.",
    "abstract": "Two-thirds of U.S. adult women are overweight or obese. High body mass index (BMI) and adult weight gain are risk factors for a number of chronic diseases, including postmenopausal breast cancer. The higher postmenopausal breast cancer risk in women with elevated BMI is likely to be attributable to related metabolic disturbances including altered circulating sex steroid hormones and adipokines, elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines, and insulin resistance. Metformin is a widely used antidiabetic drug that has demonstrated favorable effects on metabolic disturbances and as such may lead to lower breast cancer risk in obese women. Further, the anti-proliferative effects of metformin suggest it may decrease breast density, an accepted biomarker of breast cancer risk. This is a Phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of metformin in overweight/obese premenopausal women who have elements of metabolic syndrome. Eligible participants will be randomized to receive metformin 850&#xa0;mg BID (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;75) or placebo (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;75) for 12&#xa0;months. The primary endpoint is change in breast density, based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquired fat-water features. Secondary outcomes include changes in serum insulin levels, serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 to insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP)-3 ratio, serum IGF-2 levels, serum testosterone levels, serum leptin to adiponectin ratio, body weight, and waist circumference. Exploratory outcomes include changes in metabolomic profiles in plasma and nipple aspirate fluid. Changes in tissue architecture as well as cellular and molecular targets in breast tissue collected in a subgroup of participants will also be explored. The study will evaluate whether metformin can result in favorable changes in breast density, select proteins and hormones, products of body metabolism, and body weight and composition. The study should help determine the potential breast cancer preventive activity of metformin in a growing population at risk for multiple diseases. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02028221 .

    "abstract": "Chronic low-level systemic and adipose tissue inflammation has been identified as a major etiologic factor in many chronic diseases, including hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. Evidence from experimental studies suggests anti-inflammatory effects of dietary flavonols such as quercetin. We investigated the effects of regular intake of quercetin on leptin, adiponectin, biomarkers of inflammation, glucose and insulin in overweight-to-obese patients with pre- and stage 1 hypertension. Another objective was to assess the safety of daily quercetin supplementation measured by parameters of liver and kidney function and of hematology. Subjects (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;70) were randomized to receive a supra-nutritional dose of 162&#xa0;mg/d quercetin or placebo in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover trial with 6-week treatment periods separated by a 6-week washout period. Two subjects dropped out for personal reasons. Only data from the remaining 68 subjects were included in the analysis. Compared to placebo, quercetin did not significantly affect serum concentrations of leptin and adiponectin, HOMA-AD or the ratios of leptin/adiponectin and adiponectin/leptin. Neither quercetin nor placebo significantly changed serum C-reactive protein and plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha. Compared to placebo, quercetin did not significantly affect glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, blood biomarkers of liver and renal function, hematology and serum electrolytes. A supra-nutritional dose of 162&#xa0;mg/d quercetin from onion skin extract for 6&#xa0;weeks is safe but without significant effects on parameters of systemic and adipose tissue inflammation as well as glucose and insulin in overweight-to-obese subjects with (pre-)hypertension.

However, little is known about the effects of long-term moderate CR on immune function in humans. In this multi-center, randomized clinical trial to determine CR's effect on inflammation and cell-mediated immunity, 218 healthy non-obese adults (20-50 y), were assigned 25% CR (n=143) or an ad-libitum (AL) diet (n=75), and outcomes tested at baseline, 12, and 24 months of CR. CR induced a 10.4% weight loss over the 2-y period. Relative to AL group, CR reduced circulating inflammatory markers, including total WBC and lymphocyte counts, ICAM-1 and leptin. Serum CRP and TNF-&#x3b1; concentrations were about 40% and 50% lower in CR group, respectively. CR had no effect on the delayed-type hypersensitivity skin response or antibody response to vaccines, nor did it cause difference in clinically significant infections. In conclusion, long-term moderate CR without malnutrition induces a significant and persistent inhibition of inflammation without impairing key in vivo indicators of cell-mediated immunity. Given the established role of these pro-inflammatory molecules in the pathogenesis of multiple chronic diseases, these CR-induced adaptations suggest a shift toward a healthy phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a chronic liver disease that is capable of progressing to end-stage liver disease, but generally has a benign course. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a growing public health problem with no approved therapy. NASH projected to be the leading cause of liver transplantation in the United States by 2020. Obesity, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidaemia are the most common associations of the disease. Global prevalence of NASH is 10-24% amongst general population but increases to 25-75% in obese diabetic individuals. There is an urgent need for efficient therapeutic options as there is still no approved medication. The aim of this study was to detect changes in biochemical parameters including insulin resistance, cytokines, blood lipid profile and liver enzymes following weight loss in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. One hundred obese patients with NASH, their age between 35-50 years, body mass index (BMI) from 30 to 35 Kg/m(2) were included in the study in two subgroups; the first group (A) received moderate aerobic exercise training in addition to diet regimen , where the second group (B) received no treatment intervention. The mean values of leptin, TNF-&#x3b1;, IL6, IL8, Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Homeostasis Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance- index (HOMA-IR), Total Cholesterol (TC), Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-c) , Triglycerides (TG) and BMI were significantly decreased in group (A), where the mean value of Adiponectin and High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-c) were significantly increased, while there were no significant changes in group (B). Also, there was a significant difference between both groups at the end of the study. Weight loss modulates insulin resistance, adiponectin, leptin, inflammatory cytokine levels and markers of hepatic function in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.",

    "abstract": "Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption and low-grade chronic inflammation are both independently associated with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Fructose, a major component of SSBs, may acutely trigger inflammation, which may be one link between SSB consumption and cardiometabolic disease. We sought to determine whether beverages sweetened with fructose, high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), and glucose differentially influence systemic inflammation [fasting plasma C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 (IL-6) as primary endpoints] acutely and before major changes in body weight. Secondary endpoints included adipose tissue inflammation, intestinal permeability, and plasma fetuin-A as potential mechanistic links between fructose intake and low-grade inflammation. We conducted a randomized, controlled, double-blind, crossover design dietary intervention (the Diet and Systemic Inflammation Study) in 24 normal-weight to obese adults without fructose malabsorption. Participants drank 4 servings/d of fructose-, glucose-, or HFCS-sweetened beverages accounting for 25% of estimated calorie requirements while consuming a standardized diet ad libitum for three 8-d periods. Subjects consumed 116% of their estimated calorie requirement while drinking the beverages with no difference in total energy intake or body weight between groups as reported previously. Fasting plasma concentrations of C-reactive protein and IL-6 did not differ significantly at the end of the 3 diet periods. We did not detect a consistent differential effect of the diets on measures of adipose tissue inflammation except for adiponectin gene expression in adipose tissue (P = 0.005), which was lowest after the glucose phase. We also did not detect consistent evidence of a differential impact of these sugars on measures of intestinal permeability (lactulose:mannitol test, plasma zonulin, and plasma lipopolysaccharide-binding protein). Excessive amounts of fructose, HFCS, and glucose from SSBs consumed over 8 d did not differentially affect low-grade chronic systemic inflammation in normal-weight to obese adults.

    "title": "Serum adipokines levels in patients with systemic sclerosis: A meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Systemic sclerosis is an chronic inflammatory autoimmune diseases. Adipokine has been reported to play an important role in modulating immune responses. Recent studies suggest that adipokine also plays some roles in the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis (SSc). However, published data regarding the relationship between plasma/serum adipokine levels and SSc are contradictory. The aim of this study was at performing a meta-analysis to derive a more accurate estimation and further investigate the association of plasma/serum leptin and adiponectin levels with SSc patients. PubMed, and Web of Science databases (up to Feb 20, 2016) were used to obtain all relative published literatures. The study quality was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Pooled standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated by random-effect model analysis. A total of fourteen studies were finally included in this meta-analysis. Among them, six of which were studied for the serum adiponectin levels in SSc patients, six of which were studied for the serum leptin levels in SSc patients, and two of them were studied both for serum adiponectin levels and serum leptin levels in SSc patients. The meta-analysis results showed that the serum adiponectin levels in SSc patients were significantly lower than that in normal controls (SMD = -0.608&#x2009;ng/ml, 95% CI = -1.029 to -0.186, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005). However, there were no significant differences in serum leptin levels between SSc patients and healthy controls (SMD = -0.990&#x2009;ng/ml, 95% CI = -2.340 to 0.359, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.150). The subgroup analysis showed that Asia SSc patients with age less than 50 years old had lower plasma/serum adiponectin levels when compared with controls. The serum adiponectin levels, but not serum leptin levels, in SSc patients were significantly lower than that in normal controls.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin (ADIPOQ), involved in regulating glucose levels and fatty acid oxidation, plays key roles in metabolic derangements such as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Previously, several studies have been conducted to assess the association between ADIPOQ +45 T/G polymorphism and risk of GDM. The results, however, are inconclusive. We aimed to evaluate the effect of the polymorphism on the risk of GDM using a meta-analysis. After databases searching, eight records were identified. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the association between ADIPOQ +45 T/G polymorphism and risk of GDM. No significant association was observed between the ADIPOQ +45 T/G polymorphism and the risk of GDM (heterozygote comparison: OR = 1.15, 95% CI, 0.70-1.89; homozygote comparison: OR = 1.21, 95% CI, 0.48-3.03; dominant model: OR = 0.86, 95% CI, 0.50-1.48, recessive model: OR = 1.21, 95% CI, 0.62-2.33, and allele comparison: OR = 1.17, 95% CI, 0.79-1.76, respectively). Apparent heterogeneity was detected. However, no evidence of publication bias was found. This meta-analysis provides evidence that the ADIPOQ +45 T/G polymorphism was not related to the risk of GDM. Further multicenter, prospective studies with larger sample size would be valuable to confirm the result.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the cardiovascular (CV) prognostic value of adipokines in a large prospective cohort of patients participating in the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes trial. The effects of the adipokine levels at baseline and change from baseline on the composite outcome (CV death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) were analyzed using unadjusted and fully adjusted Cox models in 2330 patients with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease who had participated in the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes trial (from January 1, 2001, through December 1, 2008). In a fully adjusted model, baseline leptin and change from baseline leptin were protective for CV events, whereas baseline adiponectin, baseline tumor necrosis factor &#x3b1; (TNF-&#x3b1;), change from baseline TNF-&#x3b1;, baseline C-reactive protein (CRP), and change from baseline CRP were harmful. The effect of baseline leptin on CV events depended on the body mass index (BMI), such that the hazard ratios (HRs) varied between 0.6 and 1.4 across the BMI quintiles (interaction P=.03). The same was true for baseline adiponectin (HR varied from 0.7 to 1.7; interaction P=.01), change from baseline monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (HR varied from 0.8 to 1.8; interaction P=.03), change from baseline TNF-&#x3b1; (HR&#xa0;varied from 0.9 to 1.4; interaction P=.02), and change from baseline IL-6 (HR varied from 0.7 to 1.8; interaction P=.005). Adipokines are independent predictors of CV events in patients with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease. The association between the specific adipokines and CV outcome varies depending on BMI. This reflects the complex pathophysiology of CV disease in obesity and may help explain the obesity paradox. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00006305.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin (APN) is an adipokine with insulin-sensitizing, anti-inflammatory, and vasculoprotective properties. Hypoadiponectinemia has been linked with disease states, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) is a strong and independent predictor of both coronary and cerebrovascular events, and has been used as a surrogate marker of subclinical atherosclerosis. The aim of this report is to systematically review the evidence on the relationship between APN and cIMT in a wide range of individuals. Medline, Embase, Biosis, Scopus, Web of Science, and Pubmed were searched for published studies and conference abstracts. The sign test and vote count methods were used to estimate the direction and significance of the relationship between APN and cIMT. The quality of the eligible studies was evaluated using an adapted version of the New Castle Ottawa quality assessment scale. Fifty-five articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria, comprised of only cross-sectional studies, including healthy subjects, general population, and individuals with metabolic, inflammatory, or other chronic diseases. Most associations between APN and cIMT followed a negative direction in the healthier and general populations, and also in cohorts with metabolic disorders and other chronic diseases, but not in those with inflammatory diseases (sign test). These associations were generally found to be weak or non-significant among all cohort groups studied (vote count). Our results are suggestive but not conclusive for an inverse association between APN levels and cIMT in diseased and non-diseased populations.",

    "abstract": "To date, most studies on the anti-inflammatory effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in humans have used a mixture of the 2 fatty acids in various forms and proportions. We compared the effects of EPA supplementation with those of DHA supplementation (re-esterified triacylglycerol; 90% pure) on inflammation markers (primary outcome) and blood lipids (secondary outcome) in men and women at risk of cardiovascular disease. In a double-blind, randomized, crossover, controlled study, healthy men (n = 48) and women (n = 106) with abdominal obesity and low-grade systemic inflammation consumed 3 g/d of the following supplements for periods of 10 wk: 1) EPA (2.7 g/d), 2) DHA (2.7 g/d), and 3) corn oil as a control with each supplementation separated by a 9-wk washout period. Primary analyses assessed the difference in cardiometabolic outcomes between EPA and DHA. Supplementation with DHA compared with supplementation with EPA led to a greater reduction in interleukin-18 (IL-18) (-7.0% &#xb1; 2.8% compared with -0.5% &#xb1; 3.0%, respectively; P = 0.01) and a greater increase in adiponectin (3.1% &#xb1; 1.6% compared with -1.2% &#xb1; 1.7%, respectively; P &lt; 0.001). Between DHA and EPA, changes in CRP (-7.9% &#xb1; 5.0% compared with -1.8% &#xb1; 6.5%, respectively; P = 0.25), IL-6 (-12.0% &#xb1; 7.0% compared with -13.4% &#xb1; 7.0%, respectively; P = 0.86), and tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1; (-14.8% &#xb1; 5.1% compared with -7.6% &#xb1; 10.2%, respectively; P = 0.63) were NS. DHA compared with EPA led to more pronounced reductions in triglycerides (-13.3% &#xb1; 2.3% compared with -11.9% &#xb1; 2.2%, respectively; P = 0.005) and the cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol ratio (-2.5% &#xb1; 1.3% compared with 0.3% &#xb1; 1.1%, respectively; P = 0.006) and greater increases in HDL cholesterol (7.6% &#xb1; 1.4% compared with -0.7% &#xb1; 1.1%, respectively; P &lt; 0.0001) and LDL cholesterol (6.9% &#xb1; 1.8% compared with 2.2% &#xb1; 1.6%, respectively; P = 0.04). The increase in LDL-cholesterol concentrations for DHA compared with EPA was significant in men but not in women (P-treatment &#xd7; sex interaction = 0.046). DHA is more effective than EPA in modulating specific markers of inflammation as well as blood lipids. Additional studies are needed to determine the effect of a long-term DHA supplementation per se on cardiovascular disease risk. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01810003.",

    "abstract": "We have previously shown that a Palaeolithic diet consisting of the typical food groups that our ancestors ate during the Palaeolithic era, improves cardiovascular disease risk factors and glucose control compared to the currently recommended diabetes diet in patients with type 2 diabetes. To elucidate the mechanisms behind these effects, we evaluated fasting plasma concentrations of glucagon, insulin, incretins, ghrelin, C-peptide and adipokines from the same study. In a randomised, open-label, cross-over study, 13 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to eat a Palaeolithic diet based on lean meat, fish, fruits, vegetables, root vegetables, eggs and nuts, or a diabetes diet designed in accordance with current diabetes dietary guidelines during two consecutive 3-month periods. The patients were recruited from primary health-care units and included three women and 10 men [age (mean &#xb1; SD) 64 &#xb1; 6 years; BMI 30 &#xb1; 7 kg/m(2); diabetes duration 8 &#xb1; 5 years; glycated haemoglobin 6.6 &#xb1; 0.6 % (57.3 &#xb1; 6 mmol/mol)] with unaltered diabetes treatment and stable body weight for 3 months prior to the start of the study. Outcome variables included fasting plasma concentrations of leptin, adiponectin, adipsin, visfatin, resistin, glucagon, insulin, C-peptide, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, glucagon-like peptide-1 and ghrelin. Dietary intake was evaluated by use of 4-day weighed food records. Seven participants started with the Palaeolithic diet and six with the diabetes diet. The Palaeolithic diet resulted in a large effect size (Cohen's d = -1.26) at lowering fasting plasma leptin levels compared to the diabetes diet [mean difference (95 % CI), -2.3 (-5.1 to 0.4) ng/ml, p = 0.023]. No statistically significant differences between the diets for the other variables, analysed in this study, were observed. Over a 3-month study period, a Palaeolithic diet resulted in reduced fasting plasma leptin levels, but did not change fasting levels of insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, incretins, ghrelin and adipokines compared to the currently recommended diabetes diet.

    "abstract": "Lipodystrophy (LD) is a rare disease with a paucity of subcutaneous adipocytes and leptin deficiency. Patients often develop severe diabetes and, additionally, show a disturbed eating behavior with reduced satiety. The disturbed eating behavior can be restored by substitution with the leptin analog metreleptin. Long-term effects of metreleptin on resting state brain connectivity in treatment-naive patients with LD have not been assessed. In this study, resting state functional MRI scans and extensive behavioral testing assessing changes in hunger/satiety regulation were performed during the first 52 weeks of metreleptin treatment in nine patients with LD. Resting state connectivity significantly increased over the course of metreleptin treatment in three brain areas (i.e., hypothalamus, insula/superior temporal gyrus, medial prefrontal cortex). Behavioral tests demonstrated that perceived hunger, importance of eating, eating frequencies, and liking ratings of food pictures significantly decreased during metreleptin therapy. Taken together, leptin substitution was accompanied by long-term changes of hedonic and homeostatic central nervous networks regulating eating behavior as well as decreased hunger feelings and diminished incentive value of food. Future studies need to assess whether metreleptin treatment in LD restores physiological processes important for the development of satiety.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of adipokines, such as adiponectin and leptin, is associated with a variety of chronic diseases, including cancer. Physical activity protects against breast cancer and one of the mechanisms which may underlie this association is exercise-induced changes in adipokine levels. The WISER Sister Trial was a three-armed randomized controlled trial in premenopausal women (n = 137) with an elevated risk for breast cancer. A 5-menstrual-cycle-long dosed aerobic exercise intervention compared low-dose exercise (150 min/wk; n = 44) or high-dose exercise (300 min/wk; n = 48) with a control group asked to maintain usual activity levels (n = 45). Exercise intensity progressed to and was maintained at 70% to 80% of age predicted heart rate max. Body composition and adipokine levels were measured at baseline and follow-up. We observed significant linear trends for increased fitness capacity (&#x394;%: -2.0% control, 10.1% low dose, 13.1% high dose), decreased fat tissue-to-total tissue mass (&#x394;%: 0.7% control, -2.9% low dose, -3.7% high dose), increased body fat adjusted adiponectin (&#x394;%: -0.6% control, 0.6% low dose, 0.9% high dose), and decreased body fat adjusted leptin (&#x394;%: 0.7% control, -8.2% low dose, -10.2% high dose). In this randomized clinical trial of premenopausal women at risk for breast cancer, we demonstrate a dose-response effect of exercise on adiponectin and leptin and that dose response is dependent on changes in body fat. Improved adipokine levels, achieved by aerobic exercise training-induced decreases in body fat, may decrease breast cancer risk for high-risk premenopausal women.

We investigated the lifestyle and metabolic determinants as well as effects of biomarkers of inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and coagulation and their changes resulting from lifestyle and metformin interventions on the increase in HDL-C in the DPP. The effects of a 1year period of intensive lifestyle change aimed at achieving 7% weight loss or metformin 850mg twice daily versus placebo on HDL-C were assessed in 3070 participants with impaired glucose tolerance, and on HDL particle concentration (HDL-P) and size in a subgroup of 1645 individuals. Treatment-associated changes in lifestyle and metabolic factors as well as in novel biomarkers were investigated for their associations with change in HDL-C using multiple regression analysis. After adjusting for BMI, insulin resistance, glycemia, dietary saturated fat, alcohol intake, physical activity and nine different biomarkers, only adiponectin accounted for the effect of intensive lifestyle change on HDL-C via an increase in large HDL-P. By contrast baseline and change in BMI and tissue plasminogen activator levels attenuated the effect of metformin on HDL-C, with adiponectin having no specific effect. While both lifestyle and metformin interventions used to prevent diabetes increase HDL-C, the mechanisms involved differ between the two treatments and may have consequences for future risk of cardiovascular disease.",

We investigated the effect of a low glycemic index (LGI) diet on insulin concentration, fasting blood sugar (FBS), inflammatory markers, and serum adiponectin concentration among healthy obese/overweight adolescent females. In this parallel randomized clinical trial, 2 different diets, an LGI diet and a healthy nutritional recommendation diet (HNRD) with similar macronutrient composition were prescribed to 50 obese and overweight adolescent girls with the same pubertal status. Biochemical markers FBS, serum insulin concentration, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and adiponectin were measured before and after a 10 week intervention. Using an intention-to-treat analysis, data from 50 subjects were analyzed. According to a dietary assessment, GI in the LGI group was 43.22&#xb1;0.54. While the mean for FBS, serum insulin concentration, the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA), the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), and adiponectin concentration did not differ significantly within each group, the average hs-CRP and IL-6 decreased significantly in the LGI diet group after the 10 week intervention (p=0.009 and p=0.001; respectively). Comparing percent changes, we found a marginally significant decrease in hs-CRP in the LGI group compared with the HNRD group after adjusting for confounders. Compliance with an LGI diet may have favorable effect on inflammation among overweight and obese adolescent girls.",

    "abstract": "Compelling evidence suggests that the beneficial effects of weight-loss diet interventions on improvement of cardiometabolic risk factors may be partly through modulating secretion of adiponectin from adipose tissue. To investigate the effects of long-term weight-loss diets with different compositions of macronutrients on longitudinal changes in circulating adiponectin concentrations and how such changes, if they exist, affect cardiometabolic risk. In the 2-year Preventing Overweight Using Novel Dietary Strategies trial, 811 overweight or obese adults were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 diets varying in macronutrient intakes. The current analysis was restricted to participants who had baseline adiponectin measurement (n = 768). Circulating concentrations of adiponectin and cardiometabolic outcomes were repeatedly measured at baseline, 6 months, and 2 years. Circulating concentrations of adiponectin and cardiometabolic risk factors. Weight-loss diet interventions significantly increased circulating adiponectin concentrations over 2 years, similarly in 4 diet groups (P value for difference &gt;.05). We found that the increase of adiponectin was significantly associated with reduction of waist circumference and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, but associated with increase of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P &lt; .001 for each), after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, follow-up time, diet group, baseline body mass index, baseline level of respective outcome trait, and concurrent weight change. Our findings indicate that long-term interventions by weight-loss diets varying in macronutrients similarly increase circulating adiponectin, which may particularly improve abdominal fat distribution and lipid metabolism independently of weight change.",

The search included PUBMED, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar through July 1st, 2015. Finally we identified 9 RCTs and 484 participants. Meta-analysis of data from 7 studies did not find a significant change in plasma adiponectin concentrations following vitamin D supplementation (mean difference [MD]: 4.45%, 95%CI: -3.04, 11.93, p=0.244; Q=2.18, I(2)=0%). In meta-regression, changes in plasma adiponectin concentrations following vitamin D supplementation were found to be independent of treatment duration (slope: 0.25; 95%CI: -0.69, 1.19; p=0.603) and changes in serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] levels (slope: -0.02; 95%CI: -0.15, 0.12; p=0.780). Meta-analysis of data from 6 studies did not find a significant change in plasma leptin concentrations following vitamin D supplementation (MD: -4.51%, 95%CI: -25.13, 16.11, p=0.668; Q=6.41, I(2)=21.97%). Sensitivity analysis showed that this effect size is sensitive to one of the studies; removing it resulted in a significant reduction in plasma leptin levels (MD: -12.81%, 95%CI: -24.33, -1.30, p=0.029). In meta-regression, changes in plasma leptin concentrations following vitamin D supplementation were found to be independent of treatment duration (slope: -1.93; 95%CI: -4.08, 0.23; p=0.080). However, changes in serum 25(OH)D were found to be significantly associated with changes in plasma leptin levels following vitamin D supplementation (slope: 1.05; 95%CI: 0.08, 2.02; p=0.033).

Forty cerebral infarction rats were randomly grouped into control, sham operation, conventional treatment (CT) group and CT+NFT group. Fifty-two stroke patients with hemiplegia were included in this study. The bone mineral densities (BMD) of proximal hemiplegia limbs and serum ALP, BALP, BGP, IL-6 and leptin levels were detected using commercial kits. In cerebral infarction rats, the BMD, BGP, BALP, ALP and leptin concentrations in the CT+NFT group was higher compared with the control and CT group, while serum IL-6 level was more reduced by CT+NFT than control and CT. In cerebral infarction patients, both CT and CT+NFT increased the BMD, ALP, BGP and leptin levels. In addition, compared with CT, the BMD, ALP, BGP and leptin levels were markedly increased by CT+NFT. C Conclusion: NFC elevated the BMD of hemiplegia limbs, serum ALP, BGP, IL-6 and leptin levels and, thus, alleviated osteoporosis in rats and patients with cerebral infarction.",

    "abstract": "Numerous epidemiological investigations have evaluated the association between adiponectin gene T45G polymorphism and risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the results of these studies have proven to be inconsistent. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to obtain a more accurate estimation of this association. Published articles were retrieved from PubMed and Web of Science databases and pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using fixed- or random-effect models. Five case-control studies incorporating 597 cases and 701 controls were included in this meta-analysis. No association between adiponectin gene T45G polymorphism and NAFLD was established (TT vs GG: OR = 0.83, 95%CI = 0.37-1.86; TG vs GG: OR = 0.76, 95%CI = 0.33-1.79; dominant model: OR = 0.83, 95%CI = 0.37-1.84; recessive model: OR = 1.10, 95%CI = 0.69-1.76). Moreover, in a subgroup analysis, no significant correlation was found among Asian subjects. In conclusion, the T45G polymorphism of the adiponectin gene may not constitute an NAFLD risk factor. However, this needs to be further validated in single large well-designed future studies.",

    "abstract": "Although peripheral blood adipokines and insulin levels have been considered to be biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD), previous researches about levels of adipokines and insulin in blood are no conclusive. We designed this meta-analysis to validate whether peripheral adipokines and insulin can be used as a candidate biomarker in AD diagnosis. We carried out a replication study in serum by ourselves and further conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the different levels of peripheral blood adipokines and insulin between AD patients and controls. In the section of meta-analysis, the pooled weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to compare the levels of adipokines and insulin in different groups. According to our replication study, there is statistically significant lower in the levels of leptin, but conspicuous higher in the levels of adiponectin and insulin in the blood of AD patients than controls. We finally identified four studies for leptin, four studies for adiponectin and eleven studies for insulin. From the random-effect model, the pooled WMD of the levels of leptin, adiponectin and insulin of AD subjects compared with the controls was -3.90 ng/ml (95% CI: [-5.68, -2.13]), 9.42 &#xb5;g/mL (95% CI: [4.21, 14.62]), and 2.86 &#xb5;IU/ml (95% CI: [1.21, 4.50]), respectively. Our replication study and meta-analysis support lower levels of leptin and higher levels of adiponectin and insulin in AD patients with respect to controls, and indicate their potential values as important risk factors for AD. Further researches that using standardized assay for leptin, adiponectin, and insulin measurement are still needed to reveal the potential change of peripheral blood leptin, adiponectin, and insulin levels in AD participants.",

Ten studies including 1829 ACI patients and 1557 healthy controls were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Our major result revealed that ACI patients exhibited higher serum resistin levels compared with healthy controls. Asubgroup analysis based on ethnicity showed a significant association between serum resistin levels and ACI in Asians, but surprisingly not in Caucasians. The results of our meta-analysis suggest that serum resistin levels are associated with an increased risk of ACI.",

    "abstract": "Mediterranean-style diets provide cardiovascular benefits and increase insulin sensitivity. There is little evidence that adherence to Mediterranean diet may influence the levels of the inflammatory milieu in type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to assess whether Mediterranean diet influences both C-reactive protein (CRP) and adiponectin in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, and whether adherence to Mediterranean diet affects their circulating levels. In a two-arm, single-center trial, 215 men and women with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes were randomized to a Mediterranean diet (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;108, 54 males and 54 females) or a low-fat diet (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;107, 52 males and 55 females), with a total follow-up of 8.1&#xa0;years. At baseline visit and at 1&#xa0;year, body weight, HOMA index, CRP, and adiponectin and its fractions were assessed. Adherence to the diets was assessed by calculating the Mediterranean-diet score. At 1&#xa0;year, CPR fell by 37&#xa0;% and adiponectin rose by 43&#xa0;% in the Mediterranean diet group, while remaining unchanged in the low-fat diet group. The pattern of adiponectin fractions (high and non-high molecular weight) showed a response similar to that of total adiponectin. Diabetic patients with the highest scores (6-9 points) of adherence to Mediterranean diet had lower circulating CRP level and higher circulating total adiponectin levels than the diabetic patients who scored &lt;3 points on the scale (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.001). The results of this randomized controlled trial demonstrate that Mediterranean diet cools down the inflammatory milieu of type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Shift work is a risk factor for hypertension, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease. This increased risk cannot be fully explained by classic risk factors. One of the key features of shift workers is that their behavioral and environmental cycles are typically misaligned relative to their endogenous circadian system. However, there is little information on the impact of acute circadian misalignment on cardiovascular disease risk in humans. Here we show-by using two 8-d laboratory protocols-that short-term circadian misalignment (12-h inverted behavioral and environmental cycles for three days) adversely affects cardiovascular risk factors in healthy adults. Circadian misalignment increased 24-h systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by 3.0 mmHg and 1.5 mmHg, respectively. These results were primarily explained by an increase in blood pressure during sleep opportunities (SBP, +5.6 mmHg; DBP, +1.9 mmHg) and, to a lesser extent, by raised blood pressure during wake periods (SBP, +1.6 mmHg; DBP, +1.4 mmHg). Circadian misalignment decreased wake cardiac vagal modulation by 8-15%, as determined by heart rate variability analysis, and decreased 24-h urinary epinephrine excretion rate by 7%, without a significant effect on 24-h urinary norepinephrine excretion rate. Circadian misalignment increased 24-h serum interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, resistin, and tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1; levels by 3-29%. We demonstrate that circadian misalignment per se increases blood pressure and inflammatory markers. Our findings may help explain why shift work increases hypertension, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease risk.",

    "abstract": "Functional hypothalamic amenorrhoea (FHA) is a neuroendocrine disorder caused by an energy deficit and characterized by low leptin levels. Based on this, previous studies have suggested that leptin administration may play a crucial role in FHA treatment. However, FHA is also associated with abnormal psychosocial and dietary behaviour that needs to be addressed. In this context, this systematic review examined the efficacy of leptin treatment, non-pharmacological therapy and nutritional interventions in FHA. PubMed, Medline and Cochrane Library databases were searched in order to find relevant papers, including randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, prospective studies and case reports. The effects of different treatments on reproductive function, hormonal status and bone markers were recorded. Studies regarding other forms of treatment were excluded. In total, 111 papers were retrieved. After the removal of 29 duplicate papers, the abstracts and titles of 82 papers were examined. Subsequently, 53 papers were excluded based on title, and seven papers were omitted based on abstract. The remaining 11 papers were used: three based on leptin treatment, three regarding non-pharmacological treatment and five regarding dietary intervention. This literature review indicates that all of these treatment strategies improved reproductive function and hormonal status significantly, although conclusive results could not be drawn on bone markers. While leptin may be a promising new treatment, social aspects of FHA should also be addressed. As a result, a multifaceted therapeutic approach should be applied to treat affected women.",

Previous studies had been controversial with respect to the association between CHI3L1 expression and lung cancer prognosis. Thus, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the prognostic value of CHI3L1 expression in lung cancer. We searched Pubmed, Embase, and Wanfang databases to identify eligible studies. Overall survival and disease free survival were collected from included studies. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were calculated to estimate the association. Seven studies comprising 911 lung cancer patients were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed high CHI3L1 expression was independently associated with poorer overall survival in lung cancer patients (HR = 1.71, 95%CI 1.24-2.37, P = 0.001). Subgroup analysis by histological type showed that high CHI3L1 expression was independently associated with poorer overall survival in both non small-cell lung cancer patients (HR = 2.23,95%CI 1.43-3.47, P &lt; 0.001) and small-cell lung cancer patients (HR = 1.45, 95%CI 1.06-2.00, P = 0.021). In addition, sensitivity analysis by omitting single study by turns did not change the pooled outcomes obviously.

In conclusion, our meta-analysis suggests that the Leptin (-2548G/A) gene polymorphism plays an important role in breast cancer susceptibility, especially in Caucasian.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between the circulating serum leptin level and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to establish a&#xa0;correlation between serum leptin levels and RA activity. We searched the PUBMED, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. A&#xa0;meta-analysis was performed, comparing the serum/plasma leptin levels in patients with RA and healthy controls. Correlation coefficients between serum leptin level and either disease activity score&#xa0;28 (DAS28) or C&#x2011;reactive protein (CRP) in RA patients were also examined. Thirteen studies with a&#xa0;total of 648&#xa0;RA patients and 426&#xa0;controls were included in this meta-analysis. Circulating leptin level was significantly higher in the RA group than in the control group (SMD&#xa0;= 1.056, 95&#x2009;% CI&#xa0;= 0.647-1.465, p&#xa0;= 4.2&#xa0;&#xd7; 10<sup>-7</sup>).

    "title": "Systematic Review of Metabolic Syndrome Biomarkers: A Panel for Early Detection, Management, and Risk Stratification in the West Virginian Population.",
    "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome represents a cluster of related metabolic abnormalities, including central obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance, with central obesity and insulin resistance in particular recognized as causative factors. These metabolic derangements present significant risk factors for cardiovascular disease, which is commonly recognized as the primary clinical outcome, although other outcomes are possible. Metabolic syndrome is a progressive condition that encompasses a wide array of disorders with specific metabolic abnormalities presenting at different times. These abnormalities can be detected and monitored via serum biomarkers. This review will compile a list of promising biomarkers that are associated with metabolic syndrome and this panel can aid in early detection and management of metabolic syndrome in high risk populations, such as in West Virginia. A literature review was conducted using PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar to search for markers related to metabolic syndrome. Biomarkers searched included adipokines (leptin, adiponectin), neuropeptides (ghrelin), pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-&#x3b1;), anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10), markers of antioxidant status (OxLDL, PON-1, uric acid), and prothrombic factors (PAI-1). According to the literature, the concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-&#x3b1;), markers of pro-oxidant status (OxLDL, uric acid), and prothrombic factors (PAI-1) were elevated in metabolic syndrome. Additionally, leptin concentrations were found to be elevated in metabolic syndrome as well, likely due to leptin resistance. In contrast, concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10), ghrelin, adiponectin, and antioxidant factors (PON-1) were decreased in metabolic syndrome, and these decreases also correlated with specific disorders within the cluster. Based on the evidence presented within the literature, the aforementioned biomarkers correlate significantly with metabolic syndrome and could provide a minimally-invasive means for early detection and specific treatment of these disorders. Further research is encouraged to determine the efficacy of applying these biomarkers to diagnosis and treatment in a clinical setting.",

    "abstract": "Evidence has revealed that vitamin D status is associated with the cardiometabolic risk factors. Moreover, few gender-specific analyses have been performed in the clinical trials regarding vitamin D supplementation. As a result, assessing gender differences regarding the effects of vitamin D supplementation on some cardiometabolic biomarkers in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was the aim of present study. We conducted a post hoc subgroup analysis of a double blind placebo controlled study. Patients with NAFLD randomly allocated to receive one oral pearl consisting of 50,000&#x2009;IU vitamin D3 (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;27, 13 men and 14 women) or a placebo (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;26, 13 men and 13 women) every 14 days for four months. Serum lipid profiles, aminotransferases, high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), adiponectin as well as insulin resistance and dietary intakes were assessed pre- and post-study. In both genders, serum 25(OH) D3 increased significantly (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). This increase was accompanied by significant decrease in serum total cholesterol (TC) (% of change: -7% in vitamin D vs.&#x2009;+&#x2009;0.4% in placebo, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04) and LDL-C (%of change: -9.6% in vitamin D vs. -4% in placebo, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.006) in women. However, in men, vitamin D supplementation increased the levels of serum TC (% of change: +9.2% in vitamin D vs. -10% in placebo, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02) with no significant effects on LDL-C. Moreover, vitamin D significantly reduced serum hs-CRP in women. The median daily calcium intake in both genders was well below the dietary reference intake for adults. In conclusion, improved vitamin D status might decrease serum TC and LDL-C levels as well as hs-CRP in women with NAFLD. However, it might increase serum TC in men who have low daily calcium intake. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these results.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus type 2 (DMT2) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are both characterized by decreased circulating adiponectin. Recently, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists have been shown to induce adiponectin's expression. However, their interaction on clinical grounds needs to be further elucidated. DMT2 patients with abnormal aminotransferases were screened for NAFLD and subjected to liver biopsy (group A, n=17). A subgroup of patients (n=110), after assessed for eligibility criteria, was blindly randomized to receive either 6-month exenatide supplementation on glargine insulin (group B) or intense, self-regulated, insulin therapy alone (group C). Baseline patient characteristics: 49(38.6%) males, aged 63.1 &#xb1; 7.5 years-old, BMI 32.9 &#xb1; 4.9 kg/m(2), HbA1c 8.1 &#xb1; 1.2% (65 &#xb1; 14 mmol/mol), median ALT 23 U/L (range 5-126), AST 20 U/L (7-72). Group A had biopsy-proven NAFLD with a median Activity Score of 5 and fibrosis stage 3. Presence of NAFLD was accompanied by a significant decline in adiponectin (p&lt;0.001), which was negatively correlated with the degree of ALT in all groups (Spearman's correlation, rs=-0.644, p&lt;0.001). In the subgroup intervention trial, adiponectin was significantly raised in both groups B and C (t-Student for paired samples, p=0.001) by &#x394;=+24.2% (interquartile range 14.8-53.2%). This elevation was not associated with the type of intervention but with weight loss, glycemic control and reduction of C-reactive protein (one-way ANCOVA). Supplementation of exenatide to glargine insulin compared to standard insulin was: (i) effective in inducing weight loss, (ii) non-inferior in lowering HbA1c and (iii) non-inferior in increasing circulating adiponectin. Higher adiponectin was associated with lower ALT, suggesting a hepato-protective role for this cytokine.",

Sedentary time was positively associated with adiponectin in boys and girls (both P &lt; .001), and sleep duration with adiponectin in boys independent of age, FMI, and pubertal status (P &lt; .001); however, these associations disappeared after mutual adjustments for movement behavior. Sleep duration variability was positively associated with CRP in girls independent of all covariates (P &lt; .01). MVPA remained negatively associated with inflammatory markers and adiponectin, and sleep duration variability positively associated with CRP after adjustment for FMI, pubertal status, and other movement behavior. The inverse association between MVPA and adiponectin conflicts with the anti-inflammatory properties of adiponectin.",

Group of 131 patients suffering from GERD was formed. Patients completed questionnaires. We had performed a physical examination, laboratory and instrumental examination, measuring the level of leptin and its receptor. Cohort was divided into two groups: primary (n 104)- persons with obesity and excess weight, and the comparison group (n = 27) - people with normal body weight. All patients had been appointed drug Pantoprazole. Additionally we were recruited 20 patients followed by randomization to monotherapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), or a combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA).

    "abstract": "The relatively recent advent of polyphenol supplement for exercise studies has been tested in a variety of forms and doses. However, the dose-response on adipokines and oxidative stress biomarker effect remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of intense, long-duration (48-h) exercise, and a single dose of proanthocyanidin, on plasma leptin, adiponectin, and electronegative low-density lipoprotein (LDL(-)) concentrations. Fifty-four healthy male army cadets (22&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;2&#xa0;years) participated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study and were distributed between control (CG; n&#xa0;=&#xa0;27) and supplemented groups (SG; n&#xa0;=&#xa0;27). Immediately before the start of the exercise, both CG and SG groups received a capsule containing starch (200&#xa0;mg) or proanthocyanidin (dry Vitis vinifera extract, 200&#xa0;mg), respectively. Following a 12-h fasting period, the plasma adiponectin, leptin, and LDL(-) concentrations were measured prior to the start of the exercise after 24 and 48&#xa0;h of military training, and after 24&#xa0;h of rest. The effects of the proanthocyanidin (supplement), exercise (time), and their interaction were investigated using factorial two-way ANOVA.

    "abstract": "Macrophages constitute a heterogeneous cell population with pro- (M&#x3a6;1) and anti-inflammatory (M&#x3a6;2) cells. The soluble chitinase-like-protein YKL-40 is expressed in macrophages and various other cell types, and has been linked to a variety of inflammatory diseases, including COPD. Dexamethasone strongly reduces YKL-40 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in vitro. We hypothesized that: a) YKL-40 is differentially expressed by M&#x3a6;1 and M&#x3a6;2, b) is decreased by corticosteroids and c) that long-term treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) affects YKL-40 levels in serum and sputum of COPD patients. Monocytes of healthy subjects were cultured in vitro for 7 days with either GM-CSF or M-CSF (for M&#x3a6;1 and M&#x3a6;2, respectively) and stimulated for 24 h with LPS, TNF&#x3b1;, or oncostatin M (OSM). M&#x3a6;1 and M&#x3a6;2 differentiation was assessed by measuring secretion of IL-12p40 and IL-10, respectively. YKL-40 expression in macrophages was measured by quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) and ELISA; serum and sputum YKL-40 levels were analyzed by ELISA. Pro-inflammatory M&#x3a6;1 cells secreted significantly more YKL-40 than M&#x3a6;2, which was independent of stimulation with LPS, TNF&#x3b1; or OSM (p &lt; 0.001) and confirmed by qPCR. Dexamethasone dose-dependently and significantly inhibited YKL-40 protein and mRNA levels in M&#x3a6;1. Serum YKL-40 levels of COPD patients were significantly higher than sputum YKL-40 levels but were not significantly changed by ICS treatment. YKL-40 secretion from M&#x3a6;1 cells is higher than from M&#x3a6;2 cells and is unaffected by further stimulation with pro-inflammatory agents. Furthermore, YKL-40 release from cultured monocyte-derived macrophages is inhibited by dexamethasone especially in M&#x3a6;1, but ICS treatment did not change YKL-40 serum and sputum levels in COPD. These results indicate that YKL-40 expression could be used as a marker for M&#x3a6;1 macrophages in vitro, but not for monitoring the effect of ICS in COPD.

    "abstract": "Studies have come to conflicting conclusions about whether adiponectin (APN) expression is associated with cancer prognosis. To help resolve this question, we meta-analyzed the available evidence. PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the Chinese Biological Medical Database and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure Database were systematically searched to identify all eligible studies examining APN expression and prognosis for patients with any type of cancer. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) related to overall survival (OS) or disease-free survival (DFS) were calculated. Ten studies involving 999 patients were meta-analyzed. Analysis across all patients revealed no significant association between high/positive APN expression and DFS, but they did show a significant association between high/positive APN expression and OS (HR 1.51, 95 %CI 1.21 to 1.89). Subgroup analysis showed that high/positive APN expression in non-Asians was significantly associated with both DFS (HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.80) and OS (HR 1.53, 95 %CI 1.20 to 1.96), but no such associations were observed in Asians. In addition, high/positive APN expression was significantly associated with OS across all patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HR 1.89, 95 %CI 1.20 to 2.98). The available evidence suggests that high/positive APN expression is associated with poor prognosis for patients with various carcinomas, especially for non-Asian cancer patients and for all patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. These findings should be confirmed and extended in large, well-designed studies.",

    "abstract": "The effects of twice-daily GLP-1 analogue injections added on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (T2DM) were unknown. After optimization of blood glucose in the first 3 days by CSII during hospitalization, patients with poorly controlled T2DM were randomized to receive CSII combined with injections of exenatide or placebo for another 3 days. A total of 51 patients (30 in exenatide and 21 in placebo groups) with mean A1C 11% were studied. There was no difference in mean glucose but a significant higher standard deviation of plasma glucose (SDPG) was found in the exenatide group (50.51 &#xb1; 2.43 vs. 41.49 &#xb1; 3.00 mg/dl, p = 0.027). The improvement of incremental area under the curve (AUC) of glucose and insulinogenic index (Insulin 0-peak/ Glucose 0-peak) in 75 g oral glucose tolerance test was prominent in the exenatide group (p &lt; 0.01). The adiponectin level was significantly increased with exenatide added on (0.39 &#xb1; 0.32 vs. -1.62 &#xb1; 0.97 &#x3bc;g/mL, in exenatide and placebo groups, respectively, p = 0.045). In conclusion, the add-on of GLP-1 analogue to CSII increased glucose variability and the &#x3b2; - cell response in patients with poorly controlled T2DM.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is rising, as is the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes. It is increasingly recognized that an impaired pattern in adipokine secretion could play a pivotal role in the development of NAFLD. We performed a systematic review to evaluate the potential link between newly described adipokines and liver histology in biopsy-proven NAFLD patients. A computerized literature search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science electronic databases. Thirty-one cross-sectional studies were included, resulting in a total of seven different investigated adipokines. Studies included in this review mainly had a good methodological quality. Most adipokines were suggested to be involved in the inflammatory response that develops within the context of NAFLD, either at hepatic or systemic level, and/or hepatic insulin resistance. Based on literature, clinical studies suggest that chemerin, resistin and adipocyte-fatty-acid-binding protein potentially are involved in NAFLD pathogenesis and/or progression. However, major inconsistency still exists, and there is a high need for larger studies, together with the need of standardized assays to determine adipokine levels.",

    "abstract": "Limited studies have shown that Coleus forskohlii extract may aid in weight management. This randomized, double blind placebo-controlled clinical study assessed the effects of supplementation with C. forskohlii extract on key markers of obesity and metabolic parameters in overweight and obese individuals. Thirty participants completed the trial and they were randomly assigned to receive either 250 mg of C. forskohlii extract (n = 15) or a placebo twice daily for 12 weeks. All participants were advised to follow a hypocaloric diet throughout the study. Body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist and hip circumference, and waist to hip ratio, were monitored fortnightly. Dietary intake was assessed at the baseline and weeks 4, 8 and 12. Appetite was assessed using visual analogue scales and blood samples were analyzed for plasma lipids, ghrelin, leptin, glucose and insulin at the baseline and end of the intervention. Significant reductions to waist and hip circumference (p = 0.02; p = 0.01, respectively) were recorded in both experimental and placebo groups after the 12 week intervention. Furthermore, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) was significantly increased (p = 0.01) in both groups. The experimental group showed a favorable improvement in insulin concentration and insulin resistance (p = 0.001; 0.01 respectively) compared to the placebo group. These findings suggest that C. forskohlii extract in conjunction with a hypocaloric diet may be useful in the management of metabolic risk factors.",

We aimed to characterize antimetreleptin antibody development, including in vitro neutralizing activity. Two randomized controlled studies in patients with obesity (twice-daily metreleptin &#xb1; pramlintide for 20-52 weeks; 2006-2009); two long-term, open-label studies in patients with lipodystrophy (once-daily or twice-daily metreleptin for 2 months to 12&#xb7;3 years; 2000-2014). A total of 579 metreleptin-treated patients with obesity and 134 metreleptin-treated patients with lipodystrophy (antibody/neutralizing activity data: n = 105). Antimetreleptin antibodies, in vitro neutralizing activity. Antimetreleptin antibodies developed in most patients (obese: 96-100%; lipodystrophy: 86-92%). Peak antibody titers (approximately 1:125 to 1:3125) generally occurred within 4-6 months and decreased with continued therapy (lipodystrophy). Antibody development did not adversely impact efficacy or safety (patients with obesity), except for inflammatory injection site reactions, but was associated with elevated leptin concentrations. Three patients with obesity developed in vitro neutralizing activity coincident with weight gain. Weight later returned to baseline in one patient despite persistent neutralizing activity. Four patients with generalized lipodystrophy developed in vitro neutralizing activity concurrent with worsened metabolic control; two with confounding comorbidities had sepsis. One patient with lipodystrophy had resolution of neutralizing activity on metreleptin. Development of in vitro neutralizing activity could be associated with loss of efficacy but has not been consistently associated with adverse clinical consequences. Whether neutralization of endogenous leptin with clinical consequences occurs remains unclear.",

    "abstract": "Physical activity after prostate cancer diagnosis has been shown to reduce the risk of disease progression. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effect of a 2-year home-based endurance training intervention on body composition, biomarkers levels, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time as a surrogate end-point for progressing disease. Out-clinic patients with either biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy or patients managed on active surveillance were randomized to either 24 months (3 times/week) of home-based endurance training or usual care. Aerobic fitness, body composition, insulin sensitivity, and biomarkers were measured at 0, 6, and 24 months of intervention. PSA doubling time (PSADT) was calculated based on monthly PSA measurements. Twenty-five patients were enrolled, and 19 patients completed the study. PSADT increased in the training group from 28 to 76 months (p &lt; 0.05) during the first 6 months and was correlated with changes in VO2max (p &lt; 0.01, r (2) = 0.41). The training group lost 3.6 &#xb1; 1.0 kg (p &lt; 0.05) exclusively as fat mass, yet the changes in body composition were not associated with the increased PSADT. The training group showed significant improvements in plasma triglycerides, adiponectin, IGF-1, IGFBP-1, and fasting glucose levels, but no changes in insulin sensitivity (measured as Matsuda index), testosterone, cholesterols, fasting insulin, plasma TNF-alpha, IL-6, or leptin levels. The control group showed no changes in any of the evaluated parameters across the 2-year intervention. In this small randomized controlled trial, we found that improvements in fitness levels correlated with increasing PSADT, suggesting a link between training and disease progression.",

The search process was based on the selection of publications (DB-RCT and RCT) listed in the following databases: PubMed, Web of Knowledge, Scopus, the Cochrane Library and Embase. To assess the study quality, a nine-point scoring system according to the Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used, and a high-quality study was defined by a threshold of &#x2265;7 points. Thirteen randomized controlled trials were included. The analysed population consisted of 1955 overweight and obese subjects. The mean age ranged from 13.6 to 71.7&#xa0;years. Changes in the concentration of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25(OH)D), C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x3b1;) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were assessed. To combine individual study results, a meta-analysis was performed. The baseline levels of 25(OH)D suggested vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency in the analysed population. The vitamin D supplementation did not influence on CRP (std. mean differences -0.11; 95&#xa0;% CI -0.27-0.04; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.15), TNF-&#x3b1; (std. mean differences -0.13; 95&#xa0;% CI -0.38-0.12; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.31) and IL-6 concentrations (std. mean differences 0.1; 95&#xa0;% CI -0.43-0.63; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.71).

    "abstract": "Metformin is effective for the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome, but conflicting results regarding its effect on adipocytokine levels (adiponectin, resistin, visfatin, and leptin) in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome receiving metformin treatment have been reported. To provide high-quality evidence about the effect of metformin treatment on adipocytokines in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome, relevant studies that assessed the levels of adipocytokines (adiponectin, resistin, visfatin, and leptin) in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome receiving treatment with metformin administration were reviewed and analyzed. A literature search was conducted in the SCI, PUBMED, EMBASE, and Elsevier databases, and personal contact was made with the authors. Standard mean differences and 95% confidence intervals were calculated and combined appropriately. To ensure synthesis of the best available evidence, sensitivity analyses were performed. A total of 34 data sets were included in 4 different outcomes, involving 744 women with polycystic ovary syndrome and adipocytokine levels measured both before and after metformin administration. Metformin treatment was associated with significantly elevated serum adiponectin concentrations (standard mean differences [95% confidence interval], -0.43 [-0.75 to -0.11]) and decreased serum leptin concentrations (0.65 [0.26 to 1.04]), whereas no significant difference in resistin level (-0.01 [-0.49 to 0.45]) or visfatin level (-0.04 [-1.55 to 1.46]) was found. Metformin administration was associated with increased serum adiponectin concentrations and decreased serum leptin levels. Further study is needed to elucidate whether this apparent effect decreases the incidence of type 2 diabetes and other metabolic diseases in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome later in life.",

    "abstract": "Modern horse management systems tend to limit a horse's opportunity to forage, rely on meal feeding, and may contribute to the increase in equine obesity. The use of slow-feed hay nets represents an opportunity to extend foraging time while feeding a restricted diet. The objectives of this study were to determine if limit feeding combined with a slow-feed hay net would affect morphometric measurements and postprandial metabolite and hormone patterns in overweight adult horses. Eight adult Quarter horses (BW 563 kg &#xb1; 4.6 kg; BCS 7.2 &#xb1; 0.3) were used in a randomized complete block design, with 4 horses assigned to feeding hay off the stall floor (FLOOR) and 4 horses assigned to feeding from a slow-feed hay net (NET). Horses were fed in individual stalls at 1% BW each day, split evenly between 2 meals at 0700 and 1600 h. Body weight, BCS, neck and girth circumference, cresty neck score, and ultrasound measurements of average rump fat, longissimus dorsi (LD) depth, and LD thickness were taken on d 0, 14, and 28. Three 24-h blood samplings were conducted on d 0, 14, and 28 and were analyzed for glucose, insulin, cortisol, and leptin concentrations. Samplings occurred every 30 min for 3 h postfeeding, with hourly samples occurring between feedings. Horses feeding from the FLOOR took less time to consume their hay meal compared with horses feeding from the NET ( &lt; 0.001). All horses lost weight over the 28-d period ( &lt; 0.0001); however, no difference was observed between treatments. There was no difference in BCS, neck and girth circumference, cresty neck score, rump fat, or LD depth between days or treatments ( &#x2265; 0.25). There was an effect of day on LD thickness in horses feeding from the NET. Longissimus dorsi thickness was lower on d 28 compared with that on d 0 ( = 0.0257). Only time to peak insulin and peak cortisol were affected by treatment ( &#x2264; 0.037), with horses feeding from the NET having lower values than horses feeding from the FLOOR. Average glucose, insulin, cortisol, and leptin were affected by day ( &#x2264; 0.0102). Glucose and insulin values increased, whereas cortisol and leptin levels decreased throughout the 28-d study. The use of a slow-feed hay net coupled with a limit-fed diet appears to be an effective method for decreasing BW and maintaining more homeostatic levels of postprandial metabolites and hormones when feeding overweight adult horses.",

    "abstract": "Clinical data regarding circulating leptin levels in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are conflicting. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to compare leptin levels between the following groups: patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD vs controls; simple steatosis (SS) patients vs controls; non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) patients vs controls and NASH patients vs SS patients. We performed a systematic search in PubMed, Scopus and the Cochrane Library. We analysed 33 studies, published between 1999 and 2014, including 2,612 individuals (775 controls and 1,837 NAFLD patients). Higher circulating leptin levels were observed in NAFLD patients vs controls (standardised mean difference [SMD] 0.640; 95% CI 0.422, 0.858), SS patients vs controls (SMD 0.358; 95% CI 0.043, 0.673), NASH patients vs controls (SMD 0.617; 95% CI 0.403, 0.832) and NASH patients vs SS patients (SMD 0.209; 95% CI 0.023, 0.395). These results remained essentially unchanged after excluding studies involving paediatric or adolescent populations and/or individuals undergoing bariatric surgery. There was moderate-to-severe heterogeneity among studies in all comparisons, but no significant publication bias was detected. Meta-regression analysis demonstrated that BMI was inversely associated with leptin SMD and accounted for 26.5% (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.014) and 32.7% (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.021) of the between-study variance in the comparison between NASH patients and controls and NAFLD patients and controls, respectively. However, when bariatric studies were excluded, BMI did not significantly explain the between-study variance. Circulating leptin levels were higher in patients with NAFLD than in controls. Higher levels of circulating leptin were associated with increased severity of NAFLD, and the association remained significant after the exclusion of studies involving paediatric or adolescent populations and morbidly obese individuals subjected to bariatric surgery.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is one of the most important link factors to coronary artery disease development mainly due to the pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic states favoring atherosclerosis progression. The LLLT acts in the cellular metabolism and it is highly effective to improve inflammation. The same occur in response to different kinds of exercise. However, we have not known the associate effects using LLLT therapies with aerobic plus resistance training as strategy specifically with target at human obesity control and its comorbidities. Investigate the effects of the LLLT associated with aerobic plus resistance training on cardiometabolic risk factors in obese women. Women aged 20-40 years (BMI &#x2265; 30 kg/m(2)), were divided into 2 groups: Phototherapy (PHOTO) and Placebo. They were trained aerobic plus resistance exercises (in a concurrent mode), 1h, 3 times/week during 16 weeks. Phototherapy was applied after each exercise session for 16 min, with infrared laser, wavelength 808 nm, continuous output, power 100 mW, and energy delivery 50 J. The body composition was measured with bioimpedance. Inflammatory mark concentrations were measured using a commercially available multiplex. LLLT associated with aerobic plus resistance training was effective in decrease neck (P=0.0003) and waist circumferences (P=0.02); percentual of fat (P=0.04); visceral fat area (P=0.02); HOMA-IR (P=0.0009); Leptin (P=0.03) and ICAM (P=0.03). Also, the reduction in leptin (P=0.008) and ICAM-1 (0, 05) was much more expressive in the phototherapy group in comparison to placebo group when analyzed by delta values. LLLT associated with concurrent exercise (aerobic plus resistance training) potentiates the exercise effects of decreasing the cardiometabolic risk factors in obese woman. These results suggest the LLLT associated with exercises as a new therapeutic tool in the control of obesity and its comorbidities for obese people, targeting to optimize the strategies to control the cardiometabolic risk factors in these populations.",

    "abstract": "Insulin resistance and lipotoxicity are pathognomonic in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues are licensed for type 2 diabetes, but no prospective experimental data exists in NASH. This study determined the effect of a long-acting GLP-1 analogue, liraglutide, on organ-specific insulin sensitivity, hepatic lipid handling and adipose dysfunction in biopsy-proven NASH. Fourteen patients were randomised to 1.8mg liraglutide or placebo for 12-weeks of the mechanistic component of a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov-NCT01237119). Patients underwent paired hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamps, stable isotope tracers, adipose microdialysis and serum adipocytokine/metabolic profiling. In vitro isotope experiments on lipid flux were performed on primary human hepatocytes. Liraglutide reduced BMI (-1.9 vs. +0.04kg/m(2); p&lt;0.001), HbA1c (-0.3 vs. +0.3%; p&lt;0.01), cholesterol-LDL (-0.7 vs. +0.05mmol/L; p&lt;0.01), ALT (-54 vs. -4.0IU/L; p&lt;0.01) and serum leptin, adiponectin, and CCL-2 (all p&lt;0.05). Liraglutide increased hepatic insulin sensitivity (-9.36 vs. -2.54% suppression of hepatic endogenous glucose production with low-dose insulin; p&lt;0.05). Liraglutide increased adipose tissue insulin sensitivity enhancing the ability of insulin to suppress lipolysis both globally (-24.9 vs. +54.8pmol/L insulin required to &#xbd; maximally suppress serum non-esterified fatty acids; p&lt;0.05), and specifically within subcutaneous adipose tissue (p&lt;0.05). In addition, liraglutide decreased hepatic de novo lipogenesis in vivo (-1.26 vs. +1.30%; p&lt;0.05); a finding endorsed by the effect of GLP-1 receptor agonist on primary human hepatocytes (24.6% decrease in lipogenesis vs. untreated controls; p&lt;0.01). Liraglutide reduces metabolic dysfunction, insulin resistance and lipotoxicity in the key metabolic organs in the pathogenesis of NASH. Liraglutide may offer the potential for a disease-modifying intervention in NASH.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence supports a low-carbohydrate diet for weight loss and improvement in traditional cardiovascular disease (CVD) markers. Effects on novel CVD markers remain unclear. We examined the effects of a low-carbohydrate diet (&lt;40 g/day; n = 75) versus a low-fat diet (&lt;30% kcal/day from total fat, &lt;7% saturated fat; n = 73) on biomarkers representing inflammation, adipocyte dysfunction, and endothelial dysfunction in a 12 month clinical trial among 148 obese adults free of diabetes and CVD. Participants met with a study dietitian on a periodic basis and each diet group received the same behavioral curriculum which included dietary instruction and supportive counseling. Eighty percent of participants completed the intervention. At 12 months, participants on the low-carbohydrate diet had significantly greater increases in adiponectin (mean difference in change, 1336 ng/mL (95% CI, 342 to 2330 ng/mL); p = 0.009) and greater decreases in intercellular adhesion molecule-1 concentrations (-16.8 ng/mL (-32.0 to -1.6 ng/mL); p = 0.031) than those on the low-fat diet. Changes in other novel CVD markers were not significantly different between groups. In conclusion, despite the differences in weight changes on diets, a low-carbohydrate diet resulted in similar or greater improvement in inflammation, adipocyte dysfunction, and endothelial dysfunction than a standard low-fat diet among obese persons.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of global obesity is increasing. Obesity is associated with general cancer-related morbidity and mortality and is a known risk factor for development of specific cancers. A recent large systematic review of 24 studies based on meta-analysis of 11,149 patients with prostate cancer showed a significant correlation between obesity and the risk of advanced prostate cancer. Further, a sustained reduction in BMI correlates with a decreased risk of developing aggressive disease. On the other hand, the correlation between consuming different products and prostate cancer occurrence/risk is limited.Here, we review the role of adipose tissue from an endocrine perspective and outline the effect of adipokines on cancer metabolism, with particular focus on leptin. Leptin exerts its physiological and pathological effects through modification of intracellular signalling, most notably activating the Janus kinase (JAK) 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 pathway and recently shown sphingolipid pathway. Both high levels of leptin in circulation and leptin receptor mutation are associated with prostate cancer risk in human patients; however, the in vivo mechanistic evidence is less conclusive.Given the complexity of metabolic cancer pathways, it is possible that leptin may have varying effects on prostate cancer at different stages of its development, a point that may be addressed by further epidemiological studies.",

    "abstract": "&#x2666; A low protein diet supplemented with ketoacids has been shown to improve the metabolic profile, including insulin resistance, in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), but whether ketoacids alone exert similar effects is unknown. In this prospective randomized controlled trial, we aimed to evaluate the effects of ketoacid supplementation on insulin resistance, systemic inflammation, oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction among 100 CKD patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). &#x2666; Patients from one Chinese PD center were randomly assigned to take ketoacids (12 tablets per day) (n = 50) versus a control group (n = 50) for 6 months in an open-label parallelarm design. Daily protein intake of 0.8 - 1.2 g/kg/d and daily energy intake of 25 - 35 kcal/kg/d was prescribed to both groups. Insulin resistance was evaluated using homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) index as the primary outcome. We assessed systemic inflammation using high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), oxidative stress using plasma oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL), adipokines using leptin and adiponectin and endothelial dysfunction using serum soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM) and soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM) as secondary outcomes. &#x2666; There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the 2 groups except a slightly higher age in patients assigned to the intervention. A total of 89% of participants completed the 6-month intervention. There was no significant difference in the change of HOMA-IR values from baseline between groups after adjusting for baseline age, gender, body mass index and HOMA-IR. For secondary outcomes, hs-CRP varied significantly between groups (p = 0.02), increasing over time for the control group while remaining stable for the ketoacid group. Similarly, the leptin/adiponectin ratio (LAR) differed between groups (p &lt; 0.001), remaining stable in the ketoacid group but increasing in the control group. &#x2666; Ketoacid therapy administered for 6 months had no effect on HOMA-IR but resulted in improvements in hs-CRP and LAR, suggesting metabolic benefit. Future studies are needed to confirm these results and any potential benefit in vascular health of PD patients.",

    "title": "Differential effects of leptin on adiponectin expression with weight gain versus obesity.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin exerts beneficial effects by reducing inflammation and improving lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Although the adiponectin level is lower in obese individuals, whether weight gain reduces adiponectin expression in humans is controversial. We sought to investigate the role of weight gain, and consequent changes in leptin, on altering adiponectin expression in humans. Forty-four normal-weight healthy subjects were recruited (mean age 29 years; 14 women) and randomized to either gain 5% of body weight by 8 weeks of overfeeding (n=34) or maintain weight (n=10). Modest weight gain of 3.8&#xb1;1.2&#x2009;kg resulted in increased adiponectin level (P=0.03), whereas weight maintenance resulted in no changes in adiponectin. Further, changes in adiponectin correlated positively with changes in leptin (P=0.0085). In-vitro experiments using differentiated human white preadipocytes showed that leptin increased adiponectin mRNA and protein expression, whereas a leptin antagonist had opposite effects. To understand the role of leptin in established obesity, we compared adipose tissue samples obtained from normal-weight versus obese subjects. We noted, first, that leptin activated cellular signaling pathways and increased adiponectin mRNA in the adipose tissue from normal-weight participants, but did not do so in the adipose tissue from obese participants. Second, we noted that obese subjects had increased caveolin-1 expression, which attenuates leptin-dependent increases in adiponectin. Modest weight gain in healthy individuals is associated with increases in adiponectin levels, which correlate positively with changes in leptin. In vitro, leptin induces adiponectin expression, which is attenuated by increased caveolin-1 expression. In addition, the adipose tissue from obese subjects shows increased caveolin-1 expression and impaired leptin signaling. This leptin signal impairment may prevent concordant increases in adiponectin levels in obese subjects despite their high levels of leptin. Therefore, impaired leptin signaling may contribute to low adiponectin expression in obesity and may provide a target for increasing adiponectin expression, hence improving insulin sensitivity and cardio-metabolic profile in obesity.",

    "abstract": "Gender plays a role in the development of a number of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and it has been suggested that females may be more insulin resistant in utero. We sought to assess the relationship between infant gender and insulin resistance in a large pregnancy cohort. This is a secondary analysis of a cohort from the ROLO randomized control trial of low GI diet in pregnancy. Serum insulin, glucose and leptin were measured in early pregnancy and at 28 weeks. At delivery cord blood C-peptide and leptin were measured. A comparison of maternal factors, fetal biometry, insulin resistance and leptin was made between male and female offspring. A multivariate regression model was built to account for the possible effects of maternal BMI, birthweight and original study group assignment on findings. A total of 582 women were included in this secondary analysis, of whom 304 (52.2%) gave birth to male and 278 (47.8%) gave birth to female infants. Compared to male infants at birth, female infants were significantly lighter, (3945 &#xb1; 436 vs. 4081&#xb1; 549g, p&lt;0.001), shorter in length (52.36 &#xb1; 2.3 vs. 53.05 &#xb1; 2.4cm, p&lt;0.001) and with smaller head circumferences (35.36 &#xb1; 1.5 vs. 36.10 &#xb1; 1.1cm, p&lt;0.001) than males. On multiple regression analysis, women pregnant with female fetuses were less insulin resistant in early pregnancy, i.e. had lower HOMA indices (B = -0.19, p = 0.01). Additionally female fetuses had higher concentrations of both cord blood leptin and C-peptide at birth when compared to male offspring (B = 0.38, p&lt;0.001 and B = 0.31, p = 0.03 respectively). These findings suggest gender is a risk factor for insulin resistance in-utero. Additionally, carrying a female fetus decreases the risk of insulin resistance in the mother, from as early as the first trimester.",

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the gold standard treatment for OSA; however, previous studies assessing the effect of CPAP on adiponectin in patients with OSA yielded conflicting results. The present meta-analysis was performed to determine whether CPAP therapy could increase adiponectin levels. Two reviewers independently searched PubMed, Cochrane library, Embase and Web of Science before February 2015. Information on characteristics of subjects, study design and pre- and post-CPAP treatment of serum adiponectin was extracted for analysis. Standardized mean difference (SMD) was used to analyze the summary estimates for CPAP therapy. Eleven studies involving 240 patients were included in this meta-analysis, including ten observational studies and one randomized controlled study. The meta-analysis showed that there was no change of adiponectin levels before and after CPAP treatment in OSA patients (SMD = 0.059, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.250 to 0.368, z = 0.37, p = 0.710). Subgroup analyses indicated that the results were not affected by age, baseline body mass index, severity of OSA, CPAP therapy duration, sample size and racial differences. This meta-analysis suggested that CPAP therapy has no impact on adiponectin in OSA patients, without significant changes in body weight. Further large-scale, well-designed long-term interventional investigations are needed to clarify this issue.",

Studies retrieved from database searches were screened using our stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria. Full texts of the selected studies were accessed and related data was extracted using a standardized data extraction form. Comprehensive Meta-analysis 2.0 software was used for statistical analyses. A total of 188 studies were initially retrieved from database search, and 6 studies were eventually selected, through a rigorous screening process, for inclusion in this meta-analysis.

Results of the current meta-analysis revealed that the rs2241766 T&gt;G single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) increase the risk of CRC; rs1501299 G&gt;T under dominant model was associated with increased risk of CRC; and rs266729 C&gt;G SNP under allele model conferred an increased risk of CRC. Our meta-analysis strongly suggests that the ADIPOQ rs2241766 T&gt;G, rs1501299 G&gt;T, and rs266729 C&gt;G SNPs correlate with an increased risk of CRC.",

    "abstract": "This open randomized study compares the effects of 24-week-long treatment with rosuvastatin and with atorvastatin coadministered with ezetimibe on the parameters of carbohydrate metabolism and the plasma levels of adipokynes in patients with coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). A total of 31 patients with coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus or IGT were recruited in the study. Patients were randomized into two groups: group 1 included patients who received rosuvastatin therapy in an average dose of 12.5 mg/day (n = 16); group 2 included patients who received combination treatment with atorvastatin in an average dose of 13.3 mg/day and ezetimibe (10 mg) (n = 15). Plasma levels of lipids, apoB, apoA1, glucose, insulin, leptin, and adiponectin were evaluated; HOMA-IR index (an empty stomach insulin, mu/l x fasting glucose, mmol/l)/22.5) was calculated. During the therapy, the LDL-C and apoB levels decreased by 51.7% and 42.3% in group 1 and by 51.8% and 44.9% in group 2, respectively. Reduction in the triglyceride levels was significantly more pronounced in group 2 than in group 1: 43.2% vs 17.4% (p &lt; 0.02), whereas we did not observed significant changes of HDL-C and apoA1 in either group. The increases in basal glycemia, basal insulinemia, HbA1c levels (from 6.47% [6.10-7.02%] to 6.98% 16.23-8.18%]), and HOMA-IR (from 2.14 [1.68-3.51] to 4.30 [2.31-5.77]) were found only in group 2 (p &lt; 0.05 for all). These changes were observed in 75% of patients of group 2 independently of the presence of diabetic state or IGT, but the changes were more pronounced in patients with disturbed carbohydrate metabolism. Changes of leptin levels during the therapy were diverse: 73% patients of group 1 demonstrated decrease in the leptin levels, whereas 67% of patients in group 2 experienced 57%-increase in the leptin concentrations. Degree of increased basal glycemia was associated with increase in the leptin levels (r = 0.37, p = 0.04) in the entire group of patients (n = 31). Furthermore, changes in leptin levels were negatively associated with decreased adiponectin levels (r = -0.57, p = 0.034). In case of equivalent degree of the decrease in LDL-C levels, 24-week combination therapy with atorvastatin and ezetimibe, unlike rosuvastatin treatment, induced increases in basal glycemia, insulinemia, HbA1c, and HOMA-IR index irrespective of the presence of carbohydrate metabolism disturbances before treatment. Our data suggest that adiponectin and leptin are involved in the mechanisms of adverse metabolic effects of the combination of atorvastatin and ezetimibe.",

    "title": "Treatment-Induced Changes in Plasma Adiponectin Do Not Reduce Urinary Albumin Excretion in the Diabetes Prevention Program Cohort.",
    "abstract": "Molecular data suggests that adiponectin may directly regulate urinary albumin excretion. In the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) we measured adiponectin and albuminuria before and after intervention, and we previously reported increases in adiponectin with interventions. Here we have used the DPP dataset to test the hypothesis that treatment-related increases in adiponectin may reduce albuminuria in obesity. We evaluated cross-sectional correlations between plasma adiponectin and urinary albumin excretion at baseline, and the relationship of treatment-related changes in adiponectin and albuminuria. Baseline and follow-up urine albumin to creatinine ratios (ACR (albumin to creatinine ratio)) and plasma adiponectin concentration were available in 2553 subjects. Adjusting for age, sex and race/ethnicity, we observed a statistically significant but weak inverse relationship between adiponectin and ACR at baseline (conditional Spearman's rho = (-) 0.04, p = 0.04). Although DPP treatments significantly increased plasma adiponectin, there were no treatment effects on ACR and no differences in ACR across treatment groups. There was a weak direct (not inverse) association between change in adiponectin and change in albuminuria (adjusted Spearman's rho = (+) 0.04, p = 0.03). In a large, well-characterized cohort of obese dysglycemic subjects we observed a weak inverse association between circulating adiponectin concentrations and urinary albumin excretion at baseline. Contrary to the hypothesized effect, treatment-related increases in plasma adiponectin were not associated with a reduction in ACR. The association of change in adiponectin with change in ACR should be assessed in populations with overt albuminuria before excluding a beneficial effect of increasing adiponectin to reduce ACR in obesity.",

    "title": "Effect of extended morning fasting upon ad libitum lunch intake and associated metabolic and hormonal responses in obese adults.",
    "abstract": "Breakfast omission is positively associated with obesity and increased risk of disease. However, little is known about the acute effects of extended morning fasting upon subsequent energy intake and associated metabolic/regulatory factors in obese adults. In a randomised cross-over design, 24 obese men (n=8) and women (n=16) extended their overnight fast by omitting breakfast consumption or ingesting a typical carbohydrate-rich breakfast of 2183&#xb1;393&#x2009;kJ (521&#xb1;94&#x2009;kcal), before an ad libitum pasta lunch 3&#x2009;h later. Blood samples were obtained throughout the day until 3&#x2009;h post lunch and analysed for hormones implicated in appetite regulation, along with metabolic outcomes and subjective appetite measures. Lunch intake was unaffected by extended morning fasting (difference=218&#x2009;kJ, 95% confidence interval -54&#x2009;kJ, 490&#x2009;kJ; P=0.1) resulting in lower total intake in the fasting trial (difference=-1964&#x2009;kJ, 95% confidence interval -1645&#x2009;kJ, -2281&#x2009;kJ; P&lt;0.01). Systemic concentrations of peptide tyrosine-tyrosine and leptin were lower during the afternoon following morning fasting (P&#x2a7d;0.06). Plasma-acylated ghrelin concentrations were also lower following the ad libitum lunch in the fasting trial (P&lt;0.05) but this effect was not apparent for total ghrelin (P&#x2a7e;0.1). Serum insulin concentrations were greater throughout the afternoon in the fasting trial (P=0.05), with plasma glucose also greater 1&#x2009;h after lunch (P&lt;0.01). Extended morning fasting did not result in greater appetite ratings after lunch, with some tendency for lower appetite 3&#x2009;h post lunch (P=0.09). We demonstrate for the first time that, in obese adults, extended morning fasting does not cause compensatory intake during an ad libitum lunch nor does it increase appetite during the afternoon. Morning fasting reduced satiety hormone responses to a subsequent lunch meal but counterintuitively also reduced concentrations of the appetite-stimulating hormone-acylated ghrelin during the afternoon relative to lunch consumed after breakfast.",

    "abstract": "Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with obesity. The increased production of adipocytokines in central adiposity contributes to the systemic inflammation of obesity and perhaps to psoriasis. The objective of this systematic review is to determine the association of obesity with psoriasis severity. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Database for English-language papers involving human subjects for all years. We extracted data on age, sex, body mass index (BMI), proportion obese, and psoriasis severity index score (PASI). We identified 254 articles in our search and included 9. The sample size was 134&#x2005;823 psoriasis patients. Seven of the 9 studies found a statistically significant association of increased psoriasis severity with higher BMI. Increased severity of psoriasis appears to be associated with increased BMI. Most studies were cross-sectional or case-control, making it difficult to determine temporality. Dermatologists should consider recording BMI for psoriasis patients and offering them lifestyle counseling.",

    "abstract": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR&#x3b3;), adiponectin (ADIPOQ) and fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO) have been reported as a key candidate genes for obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D) susceptibility and insulin resistance, and we hypothesize that in the background of obesity, the effect of PPAR&#x3b3;2 (rs1801282), ADIPOQ (rs16861194) and FTO (rs9939609) variant could potentially influence T2D susceptibility. To decipher a more accurate estimation toward its population-specific impact of these variants toward susceptibility to T2D, a case-control study, systematic review and a meta-analysis was performed in a South Asian population. A case-control analysis of 518 T2D cases and 518 controls of Karnataka origin were performed to analyze the association of PPAR&#x3b3;2 (rs1801282), ADIPOQ (rs16861194) and FTO (rs9939609) on the risk of T2D. In addition, a systematic review and meta-analysis for PPAR&#x3b3;2 (rs1801282) and FTO (rs9939609) was elucidated from Asian population. Our investigation showed that PPAR&#x3b3;2 (rs1801282) and FTO (rs9939609) are associated with T2D susceptibility. When T2D cohort was further stratified according to the obesity status, PPAR&#x3b3;2 (rs1801282) and FTO (rs9939609) showed association with T2D only in the obese diabetic group and ADIPOQ (rs16861194) showed no difference in risk of susceptibility to the disease. The meta-analysis of PPAR&#x3b3;2 (rs1801282) showed population-specific association for T2D susceptibility as opposed to FTO (rs9939609) which showed no difference in population effect toward T2D susceptibility. In conclusion, our study showed that PPAR&#x3b3;2 (rs1801282) and FTO (rs9939609) variants are associated with T2D susceptibility when associated with adiposity in Indian population.",

    "title": "The potential of phototherapy to reduce body fat, insulin resistance and metabolic inflexibility related to obesity in women undergoing weight loss treatment.",
    "abstract": "The metabolic flexibility is often impaired in diseases associated with obesity, and many studies are based on the hypothesis that dysfunction in peripheral tissues such as skeletal muscle, liver and adipose tissue represent the etiology of development of metabolic inflexibility. Experimental evidence shows that the use of phototherapy combined with exercise was effective in controlling the lipid profile, reducing the mass of adipose tissue, suggesting increased metabolic activity and changes in lipid metabolism. However, we found few data in the literature involving the use of phototherapy in association to physical training in the obese population. Thus, our objective was to evaluate the effects of exercise training (aerobic plus resistance exercises) plus phototherapy (laser, 808&#x2009;nm) on metabolic profile and adiponectinemia in obese women. Sixty-four obese women (BMI 30-40&#x2009;kg/m2 , age between 20 and 40 years old) were randomly assigned in two groups: Exercise Training plus SHAM group (ET-SHAM, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;32) and Exercise Training plus Phototherapy group (ET-PHOTO, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;32). The treatment consisted in physical exercise intervention and the individual application of phototherapy immediately after the end of the training session. However, in the ET-SHAM group the device was turned off simulating the phototherapy application (placebo effect). The study protocol lasted for 20 weeks and comprised of three weekly sessions of aerobic plus resistance training and application of phototherapy (when applicable). The body composition and metabolic parameters were assessed (HOMA, adiponectin, insulin, glucose). Comparing the magnitude of effects between groups (ET-PHOTO vs. ET-SHAM), we observed that physical training plus phototherapy was more effective than physical training in reducing the delta of percentage of fat mass (%; -5.60&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.59 vs. -4.33&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.5; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.04); fat mass (kg; -11.26&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.82 vs. -5.80&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.82; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0002); HOMA-IR index (-38.08&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;9.23 vs. -20.91&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;14.42; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). In addition, we observed an increase in delta (%) of total skeletal muscle mass (kg; 0.60&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.09 vs. -1.38&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.70; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.003), adiponectin concentration (ng/ml; 1.08 (0.04-3.62) vs. -0.42 (-3.15 to 2.26); P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.03) in the same comparison. Our results demonstrated for the first time that phototherapy enhances the physical exercise effects in obese women undergoing weight loss treatment promoting significant changes in inflexibility metabolic profile.",

    "abstract": "Metabolically active visceral fat may be associated with esophageal inflammation, metaplasia, and neoplasia. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the association of serum adipokines and insulin with Barrett's esophagus (BE). We performed a systematic search of multiple electronic databases, through April 2015, to identify all studies reporting associations between leptin, adiponectin, insulin, insulin resistance, and risk of BE in adults. Comparing the highest study-specific category with the reference category for each hormone, we estimated the summary adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), using a random effects model. We identified 9 observational studies (10 independent cohorts; 1432 patients with BE total, and 3550 control subjects). Meta-analysis revealed that high serum level of leptin was associated with 2-fold higher risk of BE (BE cases vs population control subjects in 5 studies: aOR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.31-3.78; I(2), 59%). Total serum level of adiponectin was not associated with BE (BE cases vs population control subjects in 5 studies: aOR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.46-1.34; I(2), 65%), although 1 study observed decreased risk of BE with increased level of low-molecular-weight adiponectin. High serum level of insulin was associated with increased risk of BE (BE cases vs population control subjects in 3 studies: aOR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.14-2.65; I(2), 0), whereas insulin resistance was not associated with increased risk of BE (BE cases vs gastroesophageal reflux disease control subjects in 2 studies: aOR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.42-2.30; I(2), 64%). Increased serum levels of leptin and insulin are associated with increased risk of BE, compared with population control subjects. In contrast, increased total serum levels of adiponectin and insulin do not seem to modify BE risk. Well-designed longitudinal studies of incident BE are needed to clarify existing associations of serum adipokines and insulin with BE.",

    "abstract": "Dyslipidemia is a key factor determining the development of both myocardial infarction (MI) and its subsequent complications. Dyslipidemia is associated with endothelial dysfunction, activation of inflammation, thrombogenesis, and formation of insulin resistance. Statin therapy is thought to be effective for primary and secondary prevention of complications associated with atherosclerosis. This study examined 210 patients with Segment elevated MI (ST elevated MI) who were treated with atorvastatin from the first 24 hours after MI. Group 1 (n=110) were given atorvastatin 20 mg/day. Group 2 (n=100) were given atorvastatin 40 mg/day. At days 1 and 12 after MI onset, insulin resistance levels determined by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index, lipid profiles, and serum glucose, insulin, adipokine, and ghrelin levels were measured. Free fatty acid levels showed a sharp increase during the acute phase of MI. Treatment with atorvastatin 20 mg/day, and especially with 40 mg/day, resulted in a decrease in free fatty acid levels. The positive effect of low-dose atorvastatin (20 mg/day) is normalization of the adipokine status. Administration of atorvastatin 20 mg/day was accompanied with a statistically significant reduction in glucose levels (by 14%) and C-peptide levels (by 38%), and a decrease in the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index on day 12. Determination of atorvastatin dose and its use during the in-hospital period and subsequent periods should take into account changes in biochemical markers of insulin resistance and adipokine status in patients with MI.",

    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic liver disorder related to inflammation. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a natural compound that has recently been considered as an anti-inflammatory factor. In the current study we aimed to evaluate the effects of CoQ10 supplementation on liver enzymes, inflammation status, and adipokines in patients with NAFLD. Forty-one subjects with NAFLD participated in the current randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The participants were randomly divided into 2 groups: one group received CoQ10 capsules (100&#xa0;mg once a day) and the other received placebo for 12 weeks. Blood samples of each patient were taken before and after the 12-week intervention period for measurement of liver aminotransferases, inflammatory biomarkers, and adipokines (adiponectin and leptin). Taking 100&#xa0;mg CoQ10 supplement daily resulted in a significant decrease in liver aminotransferases (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase [GGT]), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor &#x3b1;, and the grades of NAFLD in the CoQ10 group in comparison to the control group (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, patients who received CoQ10 supplement had higher serum levels of adiponectin (p = 0.016) and considerable changes in serum leptin (p = 0.053). However, no significant changes occurred in serum levels of interleukin-6 in both groups. The present study suggested that CoQ10 supplement at a dosage of 100&#xa0;mg could be effective for improving the systemic inflammation and biochemical variables in NAFLD.",

The objectives of this study were to characterize serum and urine adiponectin levels over time in patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and to evaluate the role of baseline levels of adiponectin as a predictor of clinical remission. This was a study of 60 individuals, ages 3-38 years, with steroid-resistant FSGS enrolled in the FSGS clinical trial. Serial measurements of serum and urine adiponectin were obtained at baseline and 26 and 52 weeks. Participants were of mean age 19.4&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;10.2 years (50% male, 33% black). Serum adiponectin (baseline mean 14.3&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;6.6 &#x3bc;g/ml) and urine adiponectin:creatinine (Uadp/cr) (baseline mean 126.8&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;178.9 &#x3bc;g/ml) directly correlated with proteinuria at all time points (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.37-0.81; all p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperlipidemia were significant independent predictors of greater serum adiponectin and Uadp/cr in multivariate analysis. Lower tertiles of baseline serum adiponectin were associated with greater response to treatment at 52 weeks when adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI) z score, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) [odds ratio (OR) 0.48; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26-0.91, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.023). For log Uadp/cr, the OR for remission was 0.43 (95% CI 0.21-0.89, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02) at 52 weeks. However, when baseline urine protein:creatinine was added to the models, the relationships were no longer significant. Serum and urine adiponectin levels were directly associated with proteinuria and paralleled changes in proteinuria over time in children and young adults with FSGS. Although baseline adiponectin was lower in responders, response to treatment in patients with FSGS was not associated with serum and urine adiponectin levels but, rather, was related to proteinuria.",

    "abstract": "Levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and adiponectin, reflecting chronic inflammation, are associated with cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes. The long-term effects of multifactorial therapy in type 2 diabetes patients on CRP and adiponectin are unknown. The ADDITION-NL study is a randomized clinical trial among screen-detected type 2 diabetes patients, randomized to intensive treatment (HbA1c &lt;7.0% (53 mmol/mol), blood pressure &#x2264;135/85 mmHg, total cholesterol &#x2264;3.5 mmol/L) or routine care. Hs-CRP and adiponectin were measured before and 1, 2 and 6 years after inclusion. We analysed the effectiveness of the intervention on hs-CRP and adiponectin levels using a mixed effects model, taking into account practice, baseline levels and different medications. A total of 424 patients were included (intensive care n&#x2009;=&#x2009;235; routine care n&#x2009;=&#x2009;189). Both groups were well matched. Body mass index, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol and HbA1c improved significantly more in the intensive care group compared to routine care group. Levels of hs-CRP decreased significantly in both treatment groups over time. Mean hs-CRP in the routine care group was 24% higher (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0027) than in the intensive treatment group during follow-up. After an initial increase the adiponectin values levelled off to nearly baseline values in both groups. The difference between the two groups after 6 years was 0.44 &#xb5;g/mL (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.27). Intensified multifactorial treatment in type 2 diabetes results in an enhanced decrease in hs-CRP. Whether this is clinically meaningful remains uncertain. The link to adiponectin seems to be more complex.",

    "abstract": "Adiposity is associated with pancreatic cancer; however, the underlying mechanism(s) is uncertain. Leptin is an adipokine involved in metabolic regulation, and obese individuals have higher concentrations. We conducted a pooled, nested case-control study of cohort participants from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study, and the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort to investigate whether prediagnostic serum leptin was associated with pancreatic cancer. A total of 731 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cases that occurred between 1986 and 2010 were included (maximum follow-up, 23 years). Incidence density-selected controls (n = 909) were matched to cases by cohort, age, sex, race, and blood draw date. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Sex-specific quintiles were based on the distribution of the controls. Overall, serum leptin was not associated with pancreatic cancer (quintile 5 vs. quintile 1: odds ratio = 1.13, 95% confidence interval: 0.75, 1.71; Ptrend = 0.38). There was a significant interaction by follow-up time (P = 0.003), such that elevated risk was apparent only during follow-up of more than 10 years after blood draw (quintile 5 vs. quintile 1: odds ratio = 2.55, 95% confidence interval: 1.23, 5.27; Ptrend = 0.004). Our results support an association between increasing leptin concentration and pancreatic cancer; however, long follow-up is necessary to observe the relationship. Subclinical disease may explain the lack of association during early follow-up.",

    "abstract": "To explore the efficacy and mechanism of hemoperfusion (HP) plus hemodialysis (HD) for peripheral neuropathy of uremic patients on maintenance hemodialysis. A total of 66 uremic patients on hemodialysis during January 2014 and April 2011 were assigned randomly into HP+HD, low-flux HD and high-flux HD groups (n=22 each). The serum levels of leptin, endothelin-1 (ET-1), parathyroid hormone (PTH) and &#x3b2;-2 microglobulin were observed pre and post-treatment. And sensory conduction velocity (SCV) was detected simultaneously. After 12-week treatment, the clinical symptoms of group HP+HD improved significantly with an effective rate of 90.91% while improvement was not obvious in groups high-flux and low-flux HD with effective rates of 31.82% and 13.64%. In HP+HD group, the levels of leptin, ET-1, PTH and &#x3b2;-2MG decreased, sensory conduction velocity increased (P&lt;0.05) and clinical symptoms improved apparently. While in low-flux HD and high-flux HD groups, leptin, ET-1, PTH and &#x3b2;-2MG had no decrease and SCV showed no improvement (P&gt;0.05). Correlation analysis showed that the levels of leptin, ET-1 and &#x3b2;-2MG were negatively correlated with SCV (r=-0.57, r=-0.47, r=-0.56). Yet PTH had no correlation with SCV (r=-0.23). Hemoperfusion plus hemodialysis may improve the clinical symptoms of peripheral neuropathy of uremic patients on maintenance hemodialysis. And it is probably due to the fact that HP+HD effectively removes such plasma middle and macromolecular toxins as leptin, ET-1, PTH and &#x3b2;-2MG.",

    "abstract": "Being overweight or obese is associated with a greater risk of coronary heart disease and stroke compared with normal weight. The role of the specific adipose tissue-derived substances, called adipocytokines, in overweight- and obesity-related cardiovascular disease (CVD) is still unclear. To investigate the associations of three adipose tissue-derived substances: adiponectin, leptin, and interleukin-6 with incident CVD in a longitudinal population-based study, including extensive adjustments for traditional and metabolic risk factors closely associated with overweight and obesity. C-reactive protein (CRP) was used as a proxy for interleukin-6. Prospective population-based study of 6.502 participants, 51.9% women, aged 30-60 years, free of CVD at baseline, with a mean follow-up time of 11.4 years, equivalent to 74,123 person-years of follow-up. As outcome, we defined a composite outcome comprising of the first event of fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease and fatal and nonfatal stroke. During the follow-up period, 453 composite CV outcomes occurred among participants with complete datasets. In models, including gender, age, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, treatment for hypertension, diabetes, body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol, high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, estimated glomerular filtration rate, adiponectin, leptin, and CRP, neither adiponectin (hazard ratio [HR] with 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.97 [0.87-1.08] per SD increase, P = 0.60) nor leptin (0.97 [0.85-1.12] per SD increase, P = 0.70) predicted the composite outcome, whereas CRP was significantly associated with the composite outcome (1.19 [1.07-1.35] per SD increase, P = 0.002). Furthermore, in mediation analysis, adjusted for age and sex, CRP decreased the BMI-associated CV risk by 43% (95%CI 29-72). In this study, neither adiponectin nor leptin were independently associated with CVD, raising questions over their role in CVD. The finding that CRP was significantly associated with an increased risk of CVD and decreased the BMI-associated CVD risk substantially, could imply that interleukin-6-related pathways may play a role in mediating overweight- and obesity-related CVD.",

The aim was to investigate the role of this polymorphism on cardiovascular risk factors, adipokine levels and weight loss secondary to a high-protein/low-carbohydrate vs. standard hypocaloric diets during 9 months. 211 obese subjects were randomly allocated to one of these two diets for a period of 9 months; diet HP (high protein/low carbohydrate) and diet S (standard). Ninety-four patients (44.5%) had the genotype GG (wild group) and 117 (55.5%) patients had the next genotypes; GA (89 patients, 42.2%) or AA (28 patients, 13.3%) (mutant group). With both diets and in both genotype groups, body mass index, weight, fat mass, waist circumference and systolic blood pressure decreased. Anthropometric parameters were higher in non-A allele carriers than A allele carriers. With diet HP in both genotypes, LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, leptin, insulin levels and HOMA-R decreased. With the diet S and only in wild genotype, the same parameters decreased, too. Our data showed a lack of association of rs6923761 GLP-1 R polymorphism with weight loss. Better anthropometric parameters in obese subjects with the mutant allele (A) of rs6923761 GLP-1 R polymorphism were observed.

    "abstract": "To investigate whether an infancy-onset, low saturated fat-oriented dietary intervention influences serum adiponectin concentration in adolescents, and to study the association of adiponectin with subclinical markers of vascular health, and cardio-metabolic risk factors. The longitudinal, randomized Special Turku Coronary Risk Factor Intervention Project aimed to modify child's dietary fat quality replacing saturated fat with unsaturated fat. Serum adiponectin (n = 521) along with weight, height, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, C-reactive protein (CRP), triglycerides, and insulin were measured at age 15 years. Adiposity was assessed using body mass index, waist circumference, and abdominal fat thickness measured with ultrasound. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to International Diabetes Foundation criteria. Vascular ultrasound measures including carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) were assessed. Adiponectin concentrations were similar in the intervention and control groups (P = .16). Adiponectin associated with carotid IMT (r = -0.13, P = .005), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = 0.18, P &lt; .0001), triglycerides (r = -0.16, P = .0004), CRP (r = -0.10, P = .02), insulin (r = -0.14, P = .002), and adiposity (r = -0.18-0.24, P &#x2264; .0001). When adjusted for adiposity indices, the association with carotid IMT was only marginally diluted (P = .03-.06), but the associations with insulin and CRP became nonsignificant. Adolescents with adiponectin &#x2264;median had 4-fold risk of metabolic syndrome than peers with adiponectin &gt;median (CI 1.8-10.2, P = .0001). In healthy adolescents, low serum adiponectin is related with carotid IMT and metabolic syndrome. We found no evidence that repeated low saturated fat-oriented dietary counseling would influence serum adiponectin in adolescence. Registered with ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00223600.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies implicate adipokines in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis. In this study we evaluated the significance of serum resistin levels in psoriasis patients using a meta-analysis approach.223 METHODS: Relevant articles were retrieved by searching the following English and Chinese databases: Cochrane Library, PubMed, Springer Link, Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). The retrieved studies were subjected to a thorough screening procedure to identify case-control studies that contained the required data. Data was extracted from each study and Version 12.0 STATA statistical software was employed for statistical analyses. Nine case-control studies, containing 421 psoriasis patients and 348 healthy controls, were included in this study. The major result of the meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant association between serum resistin levels and psoriasis (SMD=2.22, 95%CI: 1.14-3.29, P&lt;0.001). Subgroup analysis based on ethnicity showed that, compared to the healthy controls, serum resistin levels were markedly higher in psoriasis patients in both Asian and Caucasian populations (Asians: SMD=3.27, 95%CI=1.62~4.91, P&lt;0.001; Caucasians: SMD=0.91, 95%CI=0.28~1.54, P&lt;0.001). Based on our results, we conclude that serum resistin level in psoriasis patients is higher than healthy controls, and raises the possibility that elevated serum resistin levels may be a novel diagnostic marker in psoriasis and may predict the occurrence of co-morbidities in psoriasis patients.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated whether fitness changes resulting from lifestyle interventions for weight loss may independently contribute to the improvement of low adiponectin levels in obese individuals with diabetes. Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) randomized overweight/obese individuals with type 2 diabetes to intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) for weight loss or to diabetes support and education (DSE). Total and high-molecular weight adiponectin (adiponectins), weight, and cardiorespiratory fitness (submaximal exercise stress test) were measured in 1,397 participants at baseline and at 1 year, when ILI was most intense. Regression analyses examined the associations of 1-year weight and fitness changes with change in adiponectins. ILI resulted in greater improvements in weight, fitness, and adiponectins at 1 year compared with DSE (P &lt; 0.0001). Weight loss and improved fitness were each associated with changes in adiponectins in men and women (P &lt; 0.001 for all), after adjusting for baseline adiponectins, demographics, clinical variables, and treatment arm. Weight loss contributed an additional 4-5% to the variance of change in adiponectins than did increased fitness in men; in women, the contributions of improved fitness (1% greater) and of weight loss were similar. When weight and fitness changes were both accounted for, weight loss in men and increased fitness in women retained their strong associations (P &lt; 0.0001) with adiponectin change. Improvements in fitness and weight with ILI were favorably but distinctly associated with changes in adiponectin levels in overweight/obese men and women with diabetes. Future studies need to investigate whether sex-specific biological determinants contribute to the observed associations.",

In view of emerging links between vascular and adipose biology, we hypothesized that human perivascular adipose characteristics associate with carotid disease symptom status.

Nine adipose-associated biological mediators were assayed and compared in patients with symptomatic (n=15) versus asymptomatic (n=19) disease. Bonferroni correction was performed for multiple testing (&#x3b1;/9=0.006). Symptomatic patients had 1.9-fold higher perivascular adiponectin levels (P=0.005). Other circulating, subcutaneous, and perivascular biomarkers, as well as microscopic plaque characteristics, did not differ between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid endarterectomy patients display a tissue-specific difference in perivascular adipose adiponectin.

    "abstract": "HIV infection is associated with a greater risk for fasting hyperinsulinemia, impaired glucose tolerance, and higher incidence rates for vascular disease, myocardial infarction, or stroke despite effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). The underlying mechanism(s) may involve chronic low-grade systemic inflammation and immune cell activation. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (sitagliptin) improve glucose tolerance and may possess immunomodulatory effects because leukocyte CD26 cell surface receptors express dipeptidyl peptidase-4 activity. Sitagliptin will reduce inflammatory and immune cell activation markers known to be elevated in cART-treated HIV-infected (HIV+) adults with impaired glucose tolerance. This was designed as a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of sitagliptin in HIV+ adults. The setting was an academic medical center. Patients were cART-treated HIV+ men and women (n = 36) with stable HIV disease and impaired glucose tolerance. Interventions included sitagliptin 100 mg/d or placebo for 8 weeks. At baseline and week 8, plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and C-X-C motif chemokine 10 concentrations (ELISA), oral glucose tolerance, and abdominal sc adipose mRNA expression for M1 macrophage markers (monocyte chemotactic protein-1, EGF-like module-containing, mucin-like hormone receptor 1). Sitagliptin reduced glucose area under the curve (P = .002) and improved oral glucose insulin sensitivity index (P = .04) more than placebo. Sitagliptin reduced plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and C-X-C motif chemokine 10 levels more than placebo (P &lt; .009). Adipose tissue monocyte chemotactic protein-1 mRNA abundance declined significantly more (P = .01), and adipose EGF-like module-containing, mucin-like hormone receptor 1 mRNA expression tended to decline more (P = .19) in sitagliptin than placebo. Sitagliptin had beneficial systemic and adipose anti-inflammatory effects in cART-treated HIV+ adults with impaired glucose tolerance.

The results revealed that the serum resistin levels in RA were significantly higher than those in normal controls (WMD&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.767 ng/ml, 95 % CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.114-1.419, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.021), but there was no significant difference between SLE patients and normal controls (WMD&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.771 ng/ml, 95 % CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.521-6.063, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.099). Publication bias was undetected. In conclusion, this meta-analysis indicate that serum resistin level was significantly elevated in RA patients.",

    "abstract": "The lemon detox program is a very low-calorie diet which consists of a mixture of organic maple and palm syrups, and lemon juice for abstinence period of 7 days. We hypothesized that the lemon detox program would reduce body weight, body fat mass, thus lowering insulin resistance and known risk factors of cardiovascular disease. We investigated anthropometric indices, insulin sensitivity, levels of serum adipokines, and inflammatory markers in overweight Korean women before and after clinical intervention trial. Eighty-four premenopausal women were randomly divided into 3 groups: a control group without diet restriction (Normal-C), a pair-fed placebo diet group (Positive-C), and a lemon detox diet group (Lemon-D). The intervention period was 11 days total: 7 days with the lemon detox juice or the placebo juice, and then 4 days with transitioning food. Changes in body weight, body mass index, percentage body fat, and waist-hip ratio were significantly greater in the Lemon-D and Positive-C groups compared to the Normal-C group. Serum insulin level, homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance scores, leptin, and adiponectin levels decreased in the Lemon-D and Positive-C groups. Serum high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels were also reduced only in the Lemon-D group. Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels remained stable in the Lemon-D group while they decreased in the Positive-C and Normal-C groups. Therefore, we suppose that the lemon detox program reduces body fat and insulin resistance through caloric restriction and might have a potential beneficial effect on risk factors for cardiovascular disease related to circulating hs-CRP reduction without hematological changes.",

    "title": "Relationship between adiponectin, obesity and insulin resistance.",
    "abstract": "the conditions of obesity and overweight pose a major risk for a number of comorbidities, including clinical syndromes resulting from atherosclerotic disease. Recent studies strongly indicate that adipose tissue is an active endocrine organ that secretes bioactive factors such as adipokines. Adiponectin appears to have a regulatory role in the mechanism of insulin resistance and in the development of atherosclerosis. This systematic review aims to evaluate the anti-atherogenic effects of adiponectin and its properties to improve and mimic metabolic and vascular actions of insulin and its influence on endothelial function. a qualitative, exploratory and literature review was performed in the PubMed, Portal Capes and Scielo databases using as key-words adiponectin, obesity, insulin resistance, anti-inflammatory, therapeutic strategies and future prospects. evidence suggests that adiponectin has anti-atherogenic properties with anti-inflammatory effects on the vascular wall. Moreover, it modifies the vascular intracellular signaling and has indirect antioxidant effects on the human myocardium. On the other hand, there are studies suggesting that increased levels of adiponectin are paradoxically associated with a worse prognosis in heart failure syndrome, although the mechanisms are not clear. it is not clear whether adiponectin levels have any clinical significance for risk stratification in cardiovascular disease or if they simply reflect the activation of complex underlying mechanisms. Changes in lifestyle and some drug treatments for hypertension and coronary heart disease have shown significant effect to increase adiponectin levels, and simultaneously decrease in insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin is a unique anti-atherogenic adipocytokine. Regulation of adiponectin secretion is dysfunctional in cardiovascular diseases. The current trial study assessed the effects of omega-3 fatty acids with or without vitamin E on adiponectin gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and serum adiponectin and adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (A-FABP; also called ap2 and FABP4) levels in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 67 male patients with CAD. First of the four group of participants received 4 g/day omega-3 fatty acids plus 400 IU/day vitamin E (OE), second group 4 g/day omega-3 fatty acids plus vitamin E placebo (OP), or both omega-3 fatty acid and vitamin E placebos (PP) for 8 weeks. Adiponectin gene expression and serum adiponectin and FABP4 levels were evaluated. The combination of omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E in patients with CAD affected their serum adiponectin and FABP4 levels and the adiponectin/FABP4 ratio significantly. In the OP group, serum adiponectin levels did not change significantly. Consumption of omega-3 fatty acids with and without vitamin E had no significant effect on adiponectin gene expression. Omega-3 fatty acids with or without vitamin E improve adiponectin levels in patients, without any significant changes in adiponectin gene expression. This nutritional intervention may prevent complications in patients with CAD because of increased adiponectin levels.",

    "abstract": "There is considerable interest in identifying biomarkers that predict high risk for the development of macrovascular complications in patients with diabetes. Therefore, the longitudinal association between subclinical atherosclerosis as measured by internal carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) and acute-phase reactants, cytokines/adipokines, thrombosis, and adhesion molecules was examined. Biomarkers were measured at four time points over 20 years in 886 DCCT/EDIC participants with type 1 diabetes. Four composite scores were created by combining z scores generated from within the data set of individual biomarkers: acute-phase reactants (fibrinogen, C-reactive protein), thrombosis (fibrinogen, active and total plasminogen activator inhibitor [PAI]-1), cytokines/adipokines (tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 and -2, active and total PAI-1, IL-6), and endothelial dysfunction (soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and soluble E-selectin). Internal carotid IMT was measured at EDIC years 1, 6, and 12, with elevated IMT defined at each time point as being in the upper quintile of its distribution. Logistic regression models indicate that while individual biomarkers were not predictive of or associated with subclinical atherosclerosis, composite scores of acute-phase reactants (odds ratio [OR] 2.78 [95% CI 1.42, 5.42]), thrombolytic factors (OR 2.83 [95% CI 1.45, 5.52]), and cytokines/adipokines (OR 2.83 [95% CI 1.48, 5.41]) measured at our final time point EDIC years 8-11 were associated with higher levels of atherosclerosis at EDIC year 12, but findings were not consistent at early time points. The endothelial dysfunction score was not appreciably predictive of or associated with subclinical atherosclerosis at any of the time points measured. The pathophysiologic relationship between higher biomarker levels and progression of subclinical atherosclerosis remains unclear.",

Taking this into consideration we have conducted the present study in order to explore the efficacy of plant based formulation in the management of adolescent obesity and its associated biomarkers. Randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial was conducted in 130 obese adolescent of both sexes, with BMI above 25kg/m(2). The subjects were randomly assigned into test formulation group (TFG) and placebo group (PG). TFG received two 500mg capsule containing test formulation whereas, the PG received two 500mg of cellulose powder containing capsule daily for 3 months. The parameters such as blood pressure, inflammatory cytokines, adipokines and lipid profile were assessed in all subjects pre and post treatment. There was a considerable improvement in the levels of lipid profile, inflammatory cytokines, adipokines and blood pressure after treatment in TFG compared to PG. The statistical difference obtained between the groups after three months of treatment for the various biomarkers are given as mean with 95% CI for BMI (-1.4&#xb1;0.6 (-2.5 to -0.7)), total cholesterol mg/dl (-20.9&#xb1;5.0 (-30.8 to -11.0)), triglyceride mg/dl (-12.9&#xb1;5.7 (-23.9 to -1.2)), HDL-c mg/dl (7.2&#xb1;0.8 (5.6-8.8)), IL-6 (-0.7&#xb1;0.1 (-0.9 to -0.6)), hs C-reactive protein (CRP) mg/l(-1.0&#xb1;0.01 (-1.2 to -0.8)), adiponectin &#xb5;g/ml(4.9&#xb1;0.4 (4.2-5.7)), leptin ng/ml (-8.0&#xb1;1.4 (-10.7 to -5.3)), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) mmHg (-10.4&#xb1;0.8 (-12.0 to -8.7)) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) mmHg (-6.7&#xb1;0.7 (-8.1 to -5.3)). Also, there was a statistical significance within group TFG. The study concludes that the test formulation may prevent the future cardio vascular risk incidence in obese adolescents by reducing inflammation, overweight, lipid profile and by regulating adipokines. Thus it may help to improve the health pattern in obese patients with least side effects.",

    "abstract": "People with schizophrenia are more likely than general population to suffer from metabolic abnormalities, with second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) increasing the risk. Low plasma adiponectin levels may lead to metabolic dysregulations but evidence in people with schizophrenia, especially for the role of SGAs, is still inconclusive. To compare plasma adiponectin levels between people with schizophrenia and healthy controls, and to estimate the relative effect of schizophrenia and SGAs on adiponectin. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies published up to 13 June 2014 in main electronic databases. Pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) between index and control groups were generated. Appropriate subanalyses and additional subgroup analyses were carried out. Data from 2735 individuals, 1013 with and 1722 without schizophrenia, respectively, were analysed. Schizophrenia was not associated with lower adiponectin levels (SMD of -0.28, 95%CI: -0.59, 0.04; p=0.09). However, individuals with schizophrenia taking SGAs had plasma levels significantly lower than controls (p=0.002), which was not the case of drug free/drug na&#xef;ve subjects (p=0.52). As regards single antipsychotic drugs clozapine (p&lt;0.001) and olanzapine (p=0.04)--but not risperidone (p=0.88)--were associated with adiponectin levels lower than controls. People with schizophrenia per se may not have levels of adiponectin lower than controls, though treatment with SGAs is associated with this metabolic abnormality. This bears clinical significance because of hypoadiponectinemia involvement in cardiovascular diseases, even if mechanisms whereby SGAs affect adiponectin remain unexplained. Longitudinal studies evaluating long-term effects of SGAs on adiponectin are needed.",

In a double blinded intervention trial, 162 ESRD patients (mean age 67 years &#xc2; &#xb1; 13, 56 women and 106 men) undergoing chronic hemodialysis were randomized to 1.7 g n-3 PUFA daily or placebo for 3 months. Adiponectin, plasma lipids and lipoproteins were measured at baseline and after the intervention period. At baseline, adiponectin was positively correlated to HDL-cholesterol (r = 0.55, p &lt; 0.001) and inversely correlated to plasma triglycerides, body mass index (BMI) and high sensitive C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP) (r = -0.32, p &lt; 0.01, r = -0.43, p &lt; 0.01, and r = -0.21, p &lt; 0.01, respectively). Furthermore, adiponectin was inversely correlated to the plasma levels of the two major n-3 PUFA docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (r = -0.19, p &lt; 0.001, and r = -0.30, p &lt; 0.001, respectively). Baseline plasma adiponectin levels were high in both groups but after 3 months of supplementation no significant change was observed in the groups. Thus, n-3 PUFA supplementation did not change adiponectin levels. We found an elevated plasma adiponectin level, which was inversely associated with plasma levels of DHA and EPA at baseline. Supplementation with n-3 PUFAs for 3 months did not change adiponectin levels. The negative result in this study may be related to a relatively low dose and future studies with higher dose and longer duration are needed to explore this mechanism.",

To investigate the association between resistin and both all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality risk by 1) analyzing data from the Gargano Heart Study (GHS) prospective design (n=359 patients; 81 and 58 all-cause and CV deaths, respectively); 2) performing meta-analyses of all published studies addressing the above mentioned associations. MEDLINE and Web of Science search of studies reporting hazard ratios (HR) of circulating resistin for all-cause or CV mortality. Performed independently by two investigators, using a standardized data extraction sheet. In GHS, adjusted HRs per one standard deviation (SD) increment in resistin concentration were 1.28 (95% CI: 1.07-1.54) and 1.32 (95% CI: 1.06-1.64) for all-cause and CV mortality, respectively. The meta-analyses included 7 studies (n=4016; 961 events) for all-cause mortality and 6 studies (n=4,187: 412 events) for CV mortality.

Fifty-four patients with T2DM and CP were recruited. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: treatment and control. Serum and GCF visfatin concentrations and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at different time points (at baseline and 3 and 6 months after non-surgical periodontal treatment). Serum and GCF visfatin concentrations showed no significant differences between the groups at baseline (t test, P &gt;0.05). A significant decline of visfatin in the treatment group was found in serum and GCF 3 months after non-surgical periodontal treatment (t test, P &lt;0.01). Baseline and 3-month HbA1c levels were not significantly different, but at 6 months, a statistically significant difference was detected (t test, P &gt;0.05). The data suggest that non-surgical periodontal treatment is helpful for glucose control, an effect that may be associated with reduced visfatin in patients with T2DM and periodontitis. Furthermore, the data suggest that visfatin may be considered an inflammatory marker for periodontal diseases.",

LEP G2528A polymorphism was associated with increased, yet not statistically significant risk of NHL (homozygote comparison, OR=1.27, 95% CI=1.01-1.60, p=0.63; heterozygote comparison, OR=1.13, 95% CI=0.86-1.49, p=0.14; dominant model, OR=1.18, 95% CI=0.99-1.41, p=0.21; recessive model, OR=1.18, 95% CI=0.97-1.43, p=0.78; additive model, OR=1.14, 95% CI=1.01-1.28, p=0.52). Significant decrease of NHL risk was found in LEP A19G polymorphism, while no links were detected with the LEPR polymorphisms studied. In subgroup analysis, the pooled results showed that LEP A19G polymorphism was associated with decreased risk of follicular lymphoma (FL) (homozygote comparison, OR=0.56, 95% CI=0.37-0.85, p=0.69). However, no evidence of a significant association was observed in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) for variant genotypes of all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). LEP G2548A polymorphism contributes to NHL susceptibility. Also, our results provide evidence that LEP A19G polymorphism is associated with decreased risk of NHL, especially in FL. Further large-scale and well-designed studies are needed to confirm this association.",

    "title": "A common variant in the CLDN7/ELP5 locus predicts adiponectin change with lifestyle intervention and improved fitness in obese individuals with diabetes.",
    "abstract": "Overweight/obese individuals with Type 2 diabetes have low adiponectin levels, which may improve with lifestyle changes. We investigated whether genetic variants associated with adiponectin levels in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) would also be related with adiponectin changes in response to an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI), potentially through mechanisms altering the adipose microenvironment via weight loss and/or improved cardiorespiratory fitness. Look AHEAD was a randomized trial comparing the cardiovascular benefits of ILI-induced weight loss and physical activity compared with diabetes support and education among overweight/obese individuals with Type 2 diabetes. In a subsample of Look AHEAD with adiponectin data and genetic consent (n=1,351), we evaluated the effects of 24 genetic variants, demonstrated by GWAS to be cross-sectionally associated with adiponectin, on adiponectin change 1-yr postintervention. We explored via mediational analyses whether any differential effects by treatment arm were occurring through weight loss and/or improved fitness. A variant, rs222857, in the CLDN7 locus, potentially associated with epithelial barrier integrity and tight junction physiology, and a putative cis expression quantitative trail locus for elongator acetyltransferase complex subunit 5 (ELP5), predicted adiponectin increases within ILI (log-adiponectin in overall sample per copy: &#x3b2;&#xb1;SE=0.05&#xb1;0.02, P=0.008; in non-Hispanic whites: 0.06&#xb1;0.02, P=0.009). The favorable effects of rs222857 (minor allele frequency 45.5%) appeared to be mediated by mechanisms associated with improved fitness, and not weight loss. This is the first study to identify a genetic variant that modifies adiponectin response to lifestyle intervention in overweight/obese diabetic individuals.",

    "title": "Hesperidin supplementation modulates inflammatory responses following myocardial infarction.",
    "abstract": "A growing number of studies have suggested a crucial role for a variety of inflammatory mediators in myocardial infarction. Recently, several flavonoids have been shown to have cardioprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of hesperidin-a common constituent of citrus fruits-on the serum levels of inflammatory markers and adipocytocines in patients with myocardial infarction. Seventy-five patients with myocardial infarction were participated in this randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trial and were assigned to 2 intervention and control groups. Subjects consumed 600&#xa0;mg/d pure hesperidin supplement and placebo in the intervention and control groups, respectively, for 4 weeks. Serum concentrations of inflammatory markers and adipocytocines were measured at baseline and at the end of the intervention. Consumption of 600&#xa0;mg/day hesperidin significantly decreased the serum levels of E-selectin and increased adiponectin and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations in patients with myocardial infarction. The improvement in other inflammatory markers, such as interleukin (IL)-6, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), leptin, and other lipid profile was also observed at the end of the intervention, compared to the baseline values, but the difference between the hesperidin and placebo groups was not statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05). Hesperidin supplementation could compensate for decreased levels of adiponectin and HDL-C and increased levels of E-selectin in patients with myocardial infarction. These results support the concept that certain flavonoids in the diet can be associated with significant health benefits, including heart health.",

    "abstract": "Adipocytokines, including adiponectin, resistin, and visfatin may play an important role in the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis (OA). Spa therapy is one of the most commonly used non-pharmacological approaches for OA, but its mechanisms of action are not completely known. The aim of the present study was to assess whether a cycle of mud-bath therapy (MBT) influences the serum levels of adiponectin, resistin, and visfatin in patients with knee OA. As part of a prospective randomized, single blind-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of MBT in knee OA, we included in this study 95 outpatients. One group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;49) received a cycle of MBT at the spa center of Chianciano Terme (Italy) in addition to the usual treatment, and one group (control group; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;46) continued their regular care routine alone. Patients were assessed at basal time and at the end of the study (15 days) for clinical and biochemical parameters. Clinical assessments included spontaneous pain on a visual analog scale (VAS) score and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities index (WOMAC) subscores for knee OA evaluated as total pain score (W-TPS), total stiffness score (W-TSS), and total physical function score (W-TPFS). Adiponectin, resistin and visfatin serum levels were assessed by enzyme immunoassay methods. At the end of the mud-bath therapy, serum adiponectin levels showed a significant decrease (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), while no significant modifications were found in the control group at day 15. Serum resistin showed a significant decrease (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001) in the MBT group at the end of the study and a significant increase in the control patients (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). No significant modifications of visfatin were found in MBT. Furthermore, we tested the relationships between demographic and clinical parameters and adipocytokine concentrations measured in the MBT group at basal and at the end of the study. In conclusion, the present study shows that a cycle of MBT can modify serum levels of adiponectin and resistin but not the circulating levels of visfatin. In view of the recent evidences about the involvement of adiponectin and resistin in the pathogenesis and progression of OA, the decrease of these adipokines after mud-bath therapy may play a protective role in the course of the disease. However, it remains to be clarified which of the mechanisms of action of MBT may have determined the changes in serum levels of adiponectin and resistin that we observed.",

The NCIC Clinical Trials Group (NCIC CTG) MA.32 investigates effects of metformin vs placebo on invasive disease-free survival and other outcomes in early breast cancer. Maintaining blinding of investigators to outcomes, we conducted a planned, Data Safety Monitoring Committee-approved, analysis of the effect of metformin vs placebo on weight and metabolic factors at six months, including examination of interactions with baseline body mass index (BMI) and insulin, in the first 492 patients with paired blood samples. Eligible nondiabetic subjects with T1-3, N0-3, M0 breast cancer who had completed surgery and (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy (if given) provided fasting plasma samples at random assignment and at six months. Glucose was measured locally; blood was aliquoted, frozen, and stored at -80&#xb0;C. Paired plasma aliquots were analyzed for insulin, hs-CRP, and leptin. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated and comparisons analyzed using Wilcoxon signed rank test. All statistical tests were two-sided. Mean age was 52.1&#xb1;9.5 years in the metformin group and 52.6 &#xb1; 9.8 years in the placebo group. Arms were balanced for estrogen/progesterone receptor, BMI, prior (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy, and stage. At six months, decreases in weight and blood variables were statistically significantly greater in the metformin arm (vs placebo) in univariate analyses: weight -3.0%, glucose -3.8%, insulin -11.1%, homeostasis model assessment -17.1%, leptin -20.2%, hs-CRP -6.7%; all P values were less than or equal to .03. There was no statistically significant interaction of change in these variables with baseline BMI or insulin. Metformin statistically significantly improved weight, insulin, glucose, leptin, and CRP at six months. Effects did not vary by baseline BMI or fasting insulin.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of obesity is increasing in most industrialized and developing countries. We aimed to investigate the association between leptin (LEP) G-2548A polymorphisms and the risk of obesity. We searched the PubMed, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases for studies that evaluated the association between LEP G-2548A polymorphisms and obesity risk prior to March 2014. The odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated to estimate the risk of obesity. Meta-analysis of subgroup populations and different control sources was conducted using homozygote (AA vs. GG), allelic (A vs. G), dominant (AA+GA vs. GG), recessive (AA vs. GG+GA), and heterozygote (AG vs. GG) models. The heterogeneity of the studies was assessed using &#x3c7;(2)-tests based on Q-statistics. The pooled ORs were calculated using a random-effects model if there was no heterogeneity; otherwise, a random-effects model was used. Two authors extracted the data independently. The funnel plots, Begg's and Egger's test were used to assess publication bias. All statistical analyses were performed using STATA 12.0 software. Nine case-controlled publications that evaluated the association between LEP G-2548A polymorphisms and obesity risk, which included 2594 subjects (1235 obesity cases and 1359 controls), were included in our meta-analysis. No significant association between this polymorphism and obesity risk was observed (P&gt;0.05). Significant heterogeneity was detected among the studies. The results of subgroup analysis according to ethnicity and different control groups suggested that LEP G-2548A polymorphisms might increase the obesity risk in African populations in the homozygote (AA vs. GG: OR=2.38, 95% CI=1.15-4.93, P=0.020) and recessive (AA vs. GG+GA: OR=2.03, 95% CI=1.34-3.06, P=0.001) models. Overall, this meta-analysis indicated that LEP G-2548A polymorphisms are not associated with obesity risk, although significant associations were observed in the homozygote model (AA vs. GG) and the recessive model (AA vs. GG+GA) in Africa populations. Further studies are still needed to validate and confirm this association.",

    "abstract": "The primary goals were to re-examine whether sevelamer carbonate (SC) reduces advanced glycation end products (AGEs) (methylglyoxal and carboxymethyllysine [CML]), increases antioxidant defenses, reduces pro-oxidants, and improves hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Secondary goals examined albuminuria, age, race, sex, and metformin prescription. This two-center, randomized, intention-to-treat, open-label study evaluated 117 patients with T2DM (HbA1c &gt;6.5%) and stages 2-4 DKD (urinary albumin/creatinine ratio &#x2265;200 mg/g) treated with SC (1600 mg) or calcium carbonate (1200 mg), three times a day, without changing medications or diet. Statistical analyses used linear mixed models adjusted for randomization levels. Preselected subgroup analyses of sex, race, age, and metformin were conducted. SC lowered serum methylglyoxal (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.72 to -0.29; P&lt;0.001), serum CML (95% CI, -5.08 to -1.35; P&#x2264;0.001), and intracellular CML (95% CI, -1.63 to -0.28; P=0.01). SC increased anti-inflammatory defenses, including nuclear factor like-2 (95% CI, 0.58 to 1.29; P=0.001), AGE receptor 1 (95% CI, 0.23 to 0.96; P=0.001), NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1 (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.86; P=0.002), and estrogen receptor &#x3b1; (95% CI, 1.38 to 2.73; P &#x2264;0.001). SC also decreased proinflammatory factors such as TNF receptor 1 (95% CI, -1.56 to -0.72; P&#x2264;0.001) and the receptor for AGEs (95% CI, -0.58 to 1.53; P&#x2264;0.001). There were no differences in HbA1c, GFR, or albuminuria in the overall group. Subanalyses showed that SC lowered HbA1c in women (95% CI, -1.71 to -0.27; P=0.01, interaction P=0.002), and reduced albuminuria in those aged &lt;65 years (95% CI, -1.15 to -0.07; P=0.03, interaction P=0.02) and non-Caucasians (95% CI, -1.11 to -0.22; P=0.003, interaction P&#x2264;0.001), whereas albuminuria increased after SC and calcium carbonate in Caucasians. SC reduced circulating and cellular AGEs, increased antioxidants, and decreased pro-oxidants, but did not change HbA1c or the albumin/creatinine ratio overall in patients with T2DM and DKD. Because subanalyses revealed that SC may reduce HbA1c and albuminuria in some patients with T2DM with DKD, further studies may be warranted.",

    "abstract": "This overview reports published data about the interaction between physical activity and sport during and after cancer on one hand and improvement in psychological parameters, survival and biological mechanisms underlying this effect on the other hand. Practising physical activity and sport during cancer modifies parameters assessing fatigue and quality of life and reduces symptoms of depression. An association also exists between the practise of physical activity and sport and overall and cancer-specific survivals, especially after breast cancer, colon cancer and prostate cancer. These benefits seem to be mediated by a modification of circulating levels of estrogens, insulin, IGF-1 and by a decrease in insulin-resistance, by alterations in the secretion of adipokines, and by a reduction in chronic inflammation through decreased levels of cytokines. There exist some obstacles to the practise of physical activity. These obstacles are mainly related to a fear of pain induced by physical activity and to overweight. These programmes of physical activity and sport cannot be offered to all patients since there are several contra-indications, with some being present since the initial visit and others appearing during cancer management either due to disease progression or related to iatrogenic effects. Whereas benefits from physical activity and sport among cancer patients seem obvious, there are still several pending clinical and biological issues.",

    "abstract": "We compared the effects of a eucaloric moderate-fat diet (18% protein, 36% fat, and 46% carbohydrate), a eucaloric low-fat high-carbohydrate diet (18% protein, 18% fat, and 64% carbohydrate), and a low-calorie (33% reduced) low-fat high-carbohydrate diet on biomarkers of systemic inflammation. We randomly assigned 102 participants (age 21-76 years and BMI 19.2-35.5 kg/m(2)) to the three different diets for 6 weeks in a parallel design intervention trial. All foods were provided. Ninety-three participants completed all study procedures; 92 were included in the analyses. Endpoints included plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors I and II (sTNFRI and II), and adiponectin. In the unadjusted primary analyses, none of the endpoints were differentially affected by the dietary interventions despite the significantly greater reductions in body weight and fat mass in participants consuming the low-calorie low-fat diet compared to the eucaloric diets (p &lt; 0.001). When including weight change in the model in secondary analysis, adiponectin tended to be increased with weight loss (time &#xd7; weight change interaction, p = 0.051). Adjusted for weight change, adiponectin was reduced in the groups consuming the low-fat diets relative to the moderate-fat diet (p = 0.008). No effect of the intervention diets or weight loss on CRP, IL-6, or sTNFRI and II was seen in these secondary analyses. In relatively healthy adults, moderate weight loss had minimal effects on systemic inflammation, and raised plasma adiponectin only modestly. A lower dietary fat and higher carbohydrate content had little impact on measures of systemic inflammation, but reduced adiponectin concentrations compared to a moderate-fat diet. The latter may be of concern given the consistent and strong inverse association of plasma adiponectin with many chronic diseases.",

Symptoms including sleep and gastrointestinal disturbance were reported significantly more often during prednisolone vs. placebo. Short-term OCS in stable asthma did not induce significant changes in appetite, dietary intake, body weight or composition, although other adverse effects may require medical management. This evidence may assist in increasing medication adherence of asthmatics prescribed OCS for exacerbations.",

    "abstract": "We tested the hypothesis that observationally and genetically elevated YKL-40 is associated with elevated lipids and lipoproteins and with increased risk of ischemic vascular disease. We conducted cohort and Mendelian randomization studies in 96 110 individuals from the Danish general population, with measured plasma levels of YKL-40 (n=21 647), plasma lipids and lipoproteins (n=94 461), and CHI3L1 rs4950928 genotype (n=94 579). From 1977 to 2013, 3256 individuals developed ischemic stroke, 5629 ischemic cerebrovascular disease, 4183 myocardial infarction, and 10 271 developed ischemic heart disease. The 91% to 100% versus 0% to 33% YKL-40 percentile category was associated with a 34% increase in triglycerides, but only with minor changes in other lipids and lipoproteins. For these categories, the multifactorially adjusted hazard ratio was 1.99 (95% confidence interval, 1.49-2.67) for ischemic stroke, 1.85 (1.44-2.37) for ischemic cerebrovascular disease, 1.28 (0.95-1.73) for myocardial infarction, and 1.23 (1.01-1.51) for ischemic heart disease. When compared with rs4950928 CC homozygosity, the presence of G-allele was associated with a doubling (GC) or tripling (GG) in YKL-40 levels, but not with triglyceride levels or with risk of ischemic vascular disease. A doubling in YKL-40 was associated with a multifactorially adjusted observational hazard ratio for ischemic stroke of 1.18 (1.11-1.27), and a genetic odds ratio of 1.04 (0.95-1.15). Corresponding risk estimates were 1.15 (1.09-1.22) observationally and 1.06 (0.99-1.14) genetically for ischemic cerebrovascular disease, 1.08 (1.00-1.15) observationally and 1.04 (0.96-1.13) genetically for myocardial infarction, and 1.07 (1.02-1.12) observationally and 1.01 (0.96-1.07) genetically for ischemic heart disease. Elevated YKL-40 was associated with a 34% increase in triglyceride levels and with a 2-fold increased risk of ischemic stroke, whereas genetically elevated YKL-40 were not.",

Both randomized and non-randomized studies were identified from searches up to July 2013. Risk of bias was assessed with the Downs-Black checklist, the Cochrane tool and the GRADE framework. Quantitative synthesis was conducted with random-effects meta-analyses in subgroups for systemically healthy and diabetic patients. A total of 15 studies including 867 patients were included. No significant difference was found for any clinical periodontal parameter between overweight/obese and normal-weight patients. Periodontal treatment in systemically healthy overweight/obese patients was associated with higher decrease in TNF&#x3b1; levels (1 study) and higher decrease in HbA1c levels (1 study) compared to systemically healthy normal-weight patients. Contrary to diabetic normal-weight patients, periodontal treatment in diabetic overweight/obese patients was associated with an increase in adiponectin levels (2 studies) and a decrease in leptin levels (2 studies). However, the quality of existing evidence is low due to inconsistency, imprecision and lack of studies. Whereas no difference was found in clinical periodontal parameters, significant differences in inflammatory or metabolic parameters were found between overweight/obese and normal-weight patients, but existing evidence is weak.",

    "abstract": "Women at elevated risk for breast cancer are motivated to reduce their risk. Current approaches rely primarily on hormonal intervention. A preventive exercise intervention might address the same hormonal issues, yet have fewer serious side effects and less negative impact on quality of life as compared to prophylactic mastectomy. WISER Sister was a randomized controlled trial which examined effects of two doses of exercise training on endogenous sex hormone exposure, hormonally active breast tissue, and other breast cancer risk factors. Subjects for this single site trial were recruited from across the U.S., in collaboration with organizations that serve women at elevated risk, via emails, flyers, and letters. Eligibility criteria included age &#x2265; 18, eumenorrheic, and at elevated risk for breast cancer (e.g. BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and/or &#x2265; 18% lifetime risk according to prediction models). A 1:1:1 randomization scheme was used to allocate participants into: control, low dose (150 min/week), or high dose (300 min/week) home based treadmill exercise. Participants provided first morning urine samples daily for two menstrual cycles at study beginning and end for calculation of endogenous hormone exposure. In addition, women completed breast dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, a fasting blood draw, a treadmill exercise test, and surveys at baseline and follow-up. WISER Sister randomized 139 women, 122 of whom completed the study. The overall drop-out rate was 12%. Findings will be useful in understanding the potential for exercise to assist with reducing risk for breast cancer among women at elevated risk.",

    "abstract": "The results from the published studies on the association between LEP (leptin) genetic polymorphism and cancer risk are conflicting. The common G2548A genetic polymorphism has been reported to be functional and may contribute to genetic susceptibility to cancers. However, the association between LEP G2548A genetic polymorphism and cancer risk remains inconclusive. To better understand the role of LEP G2548A genetic polymorphism in global cancer, we conducted this comprehensive meta-analysis encompassing 6860 cases and 7956 controls. Overall, the LEP G2548A genetic polymorphism was associated with higher cancer risk in three genetic models (AA vs GG, AA vs AG/GG, A vs G). In the stratified analysis, there was significant association of LEP G2548A variant with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) under homozygous co-dominant model (OR=1.27, 95% CI 1.01-1.60) and additive genetic model (OR=1.14, 95% CI 1.01-1.28). Moreover, a significantly increased cancer risk was found in three genetic models (AA vs GG, AA vs AG/GG, A vs G) among Caucasian population. For Asians, no significant associations were observed in any genetic model tested. These findings suggest that the LEP G2548A genetic polymorphism may increase the susceptibility of cancers in NHL, especially in the homozygote co-dominant model and the additive genetic model among Caucasian populations. The phenomenon also indicates that the SNP functions as a recessive mutation, which needs to be verified or linked with functional studies.",

Relevant studies were identified and evaluated for quality through multiple search strategies. Studies analyzing resistin expression in the development of OA were eligible for inclusion. Data from eligible studies were extracted and included into the meta-analysis using a random-effects model. Four case-control studies consisting of a total of 375 OA patients and 214 controls as well as three sex-stratified analyses composed of 53 males and 104 females were incorporated into our meta-analysis. Our results revealed that resistin levels were significantly higher in male OA subjects and OA patients overall. Country-stratified analysis yielded significantly different estimates in resistin levels between male OA subjects and female OA subjects in the Canadian subgroup but not among the French and USA subgroups. Based on the resistin levels in OA cases and controls, resistin levels were heightened in OA patients in the Dutch population. These results support the hypothesis that high expression of resistin represents a significant and reproducible marker of poor progression in OA patients, especially in males.",

    "abstract": "Accumulated studies have shown that &#x3c9;-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) have protective roles against inflammatory responses such as hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus (DM) and cardiovascular diseases. Here we examined the effects of administering EPA to hyperlipidemic patients and other patients undergoing cardiac surgery to determine whether this treatment would increase plasma EPA levels and to clarify the association between EPA treatment and adiponectin production in hyperlipidemic patients. We also assessed the effect of preoperative EPA administration on postoperative adverse events such as postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) and postoperative infection in the cardiac surgery patients. The EPA administration significantly increased the serum EPA concentrations in both patient populations (p&#xff1c;0.001). In the hyperlipidemic patients, the EPA administration significantly increased plasma adiponectin levels (p&#xff1c;0.05), accompanied by a decrease in insulin resistance designated by the HOMA-IR (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance) score (p&#xff1c;0.05) and Hs-CRP (high sensitivity C-reactive protein) value (p&#xff1c;0.05). In the cardiac surgery patients, no significant effect of EPA on cardiac adverse events such as POAF was observed. However, our results clearly demonstrated that both the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and the 2nd-line antibiotic requirement in the EPA group were significantly decreased compared to the untreated control group (p&#xff1c;0.05). We suggest that EPA administration may exert anti-inflammatory effects in patients with hyperlipidemia and in those undergoing cardiac surgery, possibly through an increase in plasma adiponectin levels.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological studies have suggested that variants on adiponectin (ADIPOQ) and its receptor ADIPOR1 (adiponectin receptor 1) are associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk; however, the results were inconclusive. The aim of the study was to evaluate the associations between the variants on ADIPOQ and ADIPOR1 and the CRC risk with a hospital-based case-control study in the Chinese population along with meta-analysis of available epidemiological studies. With a hospital-based case-control study of 341 cases and 727 controls, the associations between the common variants on ADIPOQ (rs266729, rs822395, rs2241766 and rs1501299) and ADIPOR1 (rs1342387 and rs12733285) and CRC susceptibility were evaluated. Meta-analysis of the published epidemiological studies was performed to investigate the associations between the variants and CRC risk. For the population study, we found that variant rs1342387 of ADIPOR1 was associated with a reduced risk for CRC [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.74, 95% confidential intervals (95% CI) = 0.57-0.97; CT/TT vs. CC]. The meta-analysis also suggested a significant association for rs1342387 and CRC risk; the pooled OR was 0.79 (95% CI = 0.66-0.95) for the CT/TT carriers compared to CC homozygotes under the random-effects model (Q = 8.06, df = 4, P = 0.089; I(2) = 50.4%). The case-control study found no significant association for variants rs266729, rs822395, rs2241766, and rs1501299 on ADIPOQ or variant rs12733285 on ADIPOR1 and CRC susceptibility, which were consistent with results from the meta-analysis studies. These data suggested that variant rs1342387 on ADIPOR1 may be a novel CRC susceptibility factor.",

Relevant studies about serum ADPN levels and the pathogenesis of HCC were identified by searching electric databases and by manual search. The included studies were selected in strict accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Detailed criteria were described in Materials and methods section. Statistical analyses were conducted with the STATA 12.0 statistical software (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). A total of nine studies were incorporated into this meta-analysis after careful consideration, including 705 HCC patients and 1390 healthy controls. This meta-analysis demonstrated that the serum ADPN levels in HCC patients were significantly higher than those in healthy controls (standard mean difference (SMD)&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.97, 95% confidence intervals (CI)&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02&#x223c;1.93, P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05).

In this meta-analysis, we summarized the association of the II/I polymorphism in leptin gene and Gln223Arg polymorphism in LEPR gene with hypertension and circulating leptin. PubMed and Embase were systematically searched. Data extraction and study quality were assessed in duplicate. Statistical analyses were carried out with the STATA software (v. 11.2). A total of 11 articles written in English were eligible. Overall analysis identified a significant association between II/I polymorphism I allele and increased risk of hypertension under allelic (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval; P: 1.48; 1.06-2.08; 0.022) and homozygous genotypic (2.27; 1.20-4.29; 0.012) models. The magnitude of the association for II/I polymorphism I allele with hypertension was substantiated in Asians and for essential hypertension under both genetic models. Overall and subgroup analyses failed to reveal any significance for the association between the Gln223Arg polymorphism and hypertension risk. Carriers of Gln223Arg polymorphism Gln/Gln genotype had significantly higher circulating leptin than the Arg/Arg genotype carriers (weighted mean difference; 95% confidence interval; P: 1.61 ng/mL; 0.02-3.20; 0.047), and this significance persisted in essential hypertension subgroup (1.69 ng/mL; 0.02-3.35; 0.047). There were low probabilities of publication bias for the above comparisons. Our findings support the contributory role of the II/I polymorphism in leptin gene in the pathogenesis of hypertension, and this role was more evident in Asians and for essential hypertension.",

A systematic review of the MEDLINE and Cochrane Library databases was conducted to identify studies assessing the effect of LRT on metabolic and hepatic endpoints in patients with LS not associated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) use. Standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals of pooled results were calculated for overall changes in glucose homeostasis, lipid profile, and hepatic physiology, using an inverse-variance random-effects model. After screening, 12 studies were included for review. Meta-analysis of results from 226 patients showed that LRT decreased fasting glucose [0.75 SMD units (range 0.36-1.13), p=0.0001], HbA1c [0.49 (0.17-0.81), p=0.003], triglycerides [1.00 (0.69-1.31), p&lt;0.00001], total cholesterol [0.62 (0.21-1.02), p=0.003], liver volume [1.06 (0.51-1.61), p=0.0002] and AST [0.41 (0.10-0.73) p=0.01]. In patients with non-HAART LS, LRT improves the outcome of several metabolic and hepatic parameters. Studies were limited by small populations and therefore large prospective trials are needed to validate these findings.",

    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver injury. Chronic exposure to oxidative stress leads to depletion of liver antioxidants and abnormal cytokine production; antioxidant therapy is one of the main therapeutic lines in NAFLD. In the current study we aimed to investigate the effect of coenzyme Q10 (coQ10) therapy on several adipocytokines and insulin resistance in patients with NAFLD. In the current randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial 44 NAFLD patients were enrolled. After randomization into two groups, 22 patients received 100 mg/day coQ10 capsules and 22 patients received placebo daily for 4 weeks. BMI and WHR were calculated for patients at the beginning and end of the study and blood samples were obtained from the patients to measure serum concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), fasting serum glucose (FSG), insulin resistance (IR), vaspin, chemerin, pentraxin 3 (PTX3) and markers of oxidative stress including total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and malondialdehyde (MDA). After 4 weeks of coQ10 supplementation, waist circumference (WC) and serum AST and TAC concentrations significantly decreased in intervention group (p &lt;0.05) but no significant changes occurred in placebo-treated group. In stepwise multivariate linear regression model, change in serum FSG was a significant predictor of changes in serum vaspin, chemerin and pentraxin 3 (p &lt;0.001). The present study showed a potential for coQ10 therapy in improving several anthropometric and biochemical variables in NAFLD. Longer studies with higher doses of coQ10 are required to further evaluate this potential benefit.",

    "abstract": "Flaxseed is a promising alternative to reduce the risk of diseases associated with body weight excess because it is rich in a-linolenic acid, lignans, and dietary fiber. Flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum) can be found in brown and golden varieties; however, questions have arisen as to whether the variety may influence the health effects. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of brown and golden flaxseeds on lipid profile, glycemia, blood pressure, inflammatory status,body weight, and body composition in overweight adolescents. Seventy-five overweight adolescents (33 boys, 42 girls; age 13.7 ! 2.1 y), from Alegre-ES, Brazil, were randomized to one of the three groups (n &#xbc; 25) on a parallel, single-blind clinical trial. They received 28 g/d of brown flaxseed (BF), golden flaxseed (GF), or the equivalent amount of wheat bran (Control, CG) in different preparations at school from Monday to Friday for 11 wk. Blood pressure, anthropometric evaluation, and the analyses of blood total cholesterol, lipoproteins, glucose, and inflammatory markers were performed at the beginning and at the end of the intervention. The data were analyzed by ANCOVA at 5% significance. The groups who consumed brown and golden flaxseed showed significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure. Brown and golden flaxseed did not differentially affect plasma lipid responses, plasma glucose and inflammatory profile, although all groups (BF, GF, and CG) showed increased levels of TNF-a. The adolescents consumed about half the daily amount provided, which may not have been sufficient to exert the health benefits of flaxseed reported in the literature, concerning the lipid profile, inflammation biomarkers and body composition.",

    "title": "Dietary flavonoids added to pharmacological antihypertensive therapy are effective in improving blood pressure.",
    "abstract": "Epidemiological studies have suggested that the daily intake of flavonoids is associated with a decreased risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Our purpose was to evaluate the effect of the addition of dietary flavonoids (DF) to antihypertensive treatment (AHT), based on telmisartan (Tms) or captopril (Cpr), on blood pressure (BP), body mass index (BMI), waist/hip ratio, leptin, lipid profile and inflammation in hypertensive young patients. An open-label, randomized, controlled trial was performed among 79 patients aged 20-55 years with grade I or grade II systemic arterial hypertension. The subjects were assigned to one of four groups for AHT plus DF during 6 months: Cpr (n = 14), Cpr + DF (n = 19), Tms (n = 25) and Tms + DF (n = 21). DF consisted of dark chocolate, dehydrated red apple and green tea in an infusion to obtain a daily dose of 425.8 &#xb1; 13.9 mg epicatechin equivalents. The BP and anthropometric parameters were measured every 2 weeks. Lipid profile, leptin and hsCRP were determined by standard methods. The combination AHT-DF produced an additional and significant reduction in (i) SBP/DBP of -5/-4 mmHg, being -7/-5 for Cpr + DF and -4/-3 for Tms + DF; (ii) triglyceride levels (-30.6%) versus AHT alone (-9.6%); and (iii) leptin: Cpr + DF versus Tms + DF (p &lt; 0.005). Finally, C-reactive protein plasma levels were reduced significantly in all groups independently of the applied treatment. We conclude that the addition of flavonoids to pharmacological antihypertensive therapy shows additional benefits on BP, lipid profile, leptin, obesity and inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin (AdipoQ) is an adipose-derived plasma protein that plays an important role in hepatic lipoprotein-lipid metabolism. Emerging evidence have shown that two common polymorphisms (T45 G and G276 T) in the AdipoQ gene may contribute to increasing susceptibility to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD); however individually published studies show inconclusive results. This meta-analysis aimed to derive a more precise estimation of the association of AdipoQ T45 G (rs2241766 T&gt;G) and G276 T (rs1501299 G&gt;T) polymorphisms with NAFLD risk. Potential relevant studies were identified covering the following databases: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Bio-medicine Database (CBM), and Chinese Sci-tech Journals databases. Statistical analyses were calculated using the version 12.0 STATA software (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA). Odds ratios (ORs) and its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Ten case-control studies were included with a total of 2,672 subjects, of these 1,117 being NAFLD patients and 1,555 being healthy controls. Our meta-analysis results revealed that the T variant of AdipoQ rs2241766 T&gt;G polymorphism may be associated with an increased risk of NAFLD. There was also a significant association between the G variant of AdipoQ rs1501299 G&gt;T polymorphism and an increased risk of NAFLD. Country-stratified analysis indicated that a higher AdipoQ rs2241766 T&gt;G polymorphism was closely related with an increased risk of NAFLD in Chinese and Indian populations (all Ps &lt; 0.05); a similar result was observed in Chinese populations between AdipoQ rs2241766 T&gt;G polymorphism and an increased risk of NAFLD (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, the current meta-analysis indicates that AdipoQ rs2241766 T&gt;G and rs1501299 G&gt;T polymorphisms may contribute to an increasing susceptibility to NAFLD. Moreover, this meta-analysis also suggests for future larger studies with stratified case-control population, and greater focus on the gene-environment interactions regarding NAFLD susceptibility for valid studies.",

    "abstract": "While physical activity, energy restriction and weight loss are the cornerstone of type 2 diabetes management, less emphasis is placed on optimizing skeletal muscle mass. As muscle is the largest mass of insulin-sensitive tissue and the predominant reservoir for glucose disposal, there is a need to develop safe and effective evidence-based, lifestyle management strategies that optimize muscle mass as well as improve glycaemic control and cardiometabolic risk factors in people with this disease, particularly older adults who experience accelerated muscle loss. Using a two-arm randomized controlled trial, this 6-month study builds upon the community-based progressive resistance training (PRT) programme Lift for Life&#xae; to evaluate whether ingestion of a whey-protein drink combined with vitamin D supplementation can enhance the effects of PRT on glycaemic control, body composition and cardiometabolic health in older adults with type 2 diabetes. Approximately 200 adults aged 50 to 75 years with type 2 diabetes, treated with either diet alone or oral hypoglycaemic agents (not insulin), will be recruited. All participants will be asked to participate in a structured, supervised PRT programme based on the Lift for Life&#xae; programme structure, and randomly allocated to receive a whey-protein drink (20 g daily of whey-protein plus 20 g after each PRT session) plus vitamin D supplements (2000 IU/day), or no additional powder and supplements. The primary outcome measures to be collected at baseline, 3 and 6 months will be glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and insulin sensitivity (homeostatic model assessment). Secondary outcomes will include changes in: muscle mass, size and intramuscular fat; fat mass; muscle strength and function; blood pressure; levels of lipids, adipokines and inflammatory markers, serum insulin-like growth factor-1 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D; renal function; diabetes medication; health-related quality of life, and cognitive function. The findings from this study will provide new evidence on whether increased dietary protein achieved through the ingestion of a whey-protein drink combined with vitamin D supplementation can enhance the effects of PRT on glycaemic control, muscle mass and size, and cardiometabolic risk factors in older adults with type 2 diabetes.

    "abstract": "Fat redistribution, increased inflammation and insulin resistance are prevalent in non-diabetic subjects treated with maintenance dialysis. The aim of this study was to test whether pioglitazone, a powerful insulin sensitizer, alters body fat distribution and adipokine secretion in these subjects and whether it is associated with improved insulin sensitivity. This was a double blind cross-over study with 16 weeks of pioglitazone 45 mg vs placebo involving 12 subjects. At the end of each phase, body composition (anthropometric measurements, dual energy X-ray absorptometry (DEXA), abdominal CT), hepatic and muscle insulin sensitivity (2-step hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp with 2H2-glucose) were measured and fasting blood adipokines and cardiometabolic risk markers were monitored. Four months treatment with pioglitazone had no effect on total body weight or total fat but decreased the visceral/sub-cutaneous adipose tissue ratio by 16% and decreased the leptin/adiponectin (L/A) ratio from 3.63 &#xd7; 10(-3) to 0.76 &#xd7; 10(-3). This was associated with a 20% increase in hepatic insulin sensitivity without changes in muscle insulin sensitivity, a 12% increase in HDL cholesterol and a 50% decrease in CRP. Pioglitazone significantly changes the visceral-subcutaneous fat distribution and plasma L/A ratio in non diabetic subjects on maintenance dialysis. This was associated with improved hepatic insulin sensitivity and a reduction of cardio-metabolic risk markers. Whether these effects may improve the outcome of non diabetic end-stage renal disease subjects on maintenance dialysis still needs further evaluation. ClinicalTrial.gov NCT01253928.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is associated with metabolic dysfunctions, which may be mediated by changes in adipose tissue signaling factors. These molecules are denoted as Adipose Tissue Generated Mediators of CardioVascular Risk (ATGMCVR) here, and include leptin, adiponectin, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#x3b1;), and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1). This study examined the effect of a weight loss program on ATGMCVR in obese adults with prediabetes. Subjects were randomized to usual care (UC; n=15) or lifestyle weight loss groups (LWL; n=15). LWL was a community-based weight loss intervention to promote physical activity and healthy eating. ATGMCVR at 1-year were compared between groups by analysis of covariance; baseline value of the mediator was the covariate. Baseline means for ATGMCVR were compared between those with (n=21) and without (n=9) metabolic syndrome (MetS). At baseline, subjects were 58&#xb1;9 (SD) years, 70% female, with a BMI of 34&#xb1;4kg/m(2). One-year weight loss (%) was 7.8&#xb1;6.0% for LWL and 1.7&#xb1;4.5% for UC. Group differences at 1-year were noted (adjusted means [95%CI] for UC and LWL, respectively) for adiponectin (8526.3 [7397.7, 9827]; 10,870.9 [9432.0, 12,529.3]ng/ml; p=0.02), leptin (30.4 [26.1, 35.4]; 23.7 [20.3, 27.5]ng/ml; p=0.02), IL-6 (0.4 [0.3, 0.5]; 0.2 [0.1, 0.2] pg/ml; p=0.001), and PAI-1 (50 [42.7, 58.7]; 36.2 [30.8, 42.4]pg/ml; p=0.01). No differences in baseline ATGMCVR were seen between subjects with and without MetS. These findings suggest ATGMCVR can be improved with weight loss; larger studies are needed to determine if improvements in metabolic dysfunction are related to changes in ATGMCVR.",

We investigated, whether combined LDRnHBT and exercise treatment has an impact on bone metabolism and quality of life in a study population in an age group at risk for developing osteoporosis. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comprised guided hiking tours and hyperthermia treatment in either radon thermal water (LDRnHBT) or radon-free thermal water (PlaceboHBT). Markers of bone metabolism, quality of life and somatic complaints were evaluated. Statistics was performed by linear regression and a linear mixed model analysis. Significant changes over time were observed for most analytes investigated as well as an improvement in self-assessed health in both groups. No significant impact from the LDRnHBT could be observed. After 6&#xa0;months, the LDRnHBT group showed a slightly stronger reduction of the osteoclast stimulating protein receptor activator of nuclear kB-ligand compared to the PlaceboHBT group, indicating a possible trend. A combined hyperthermia balneo and exercise treatment has significant immediate and long-term effects on regulators of bone metabolism as well as somatic complaints. LDRnHBT and placeboHBT yielded statistically equal outcomes.",

    "title": "Causal relevance of circulating adiponectin with cancer: a meta-analysis implementing Mendelian randomization.",
    "abstract": "Some studies have observed a lower circulating level of adiponectin in cancer patients, but whether this observation is causal remains unresolved. We therefore undertook a meta-analysis implementing Mendelian randomization to exploit the causal relevance of circulating adiponectin with cancer by using multiple polymorphisms in adiponectin encoded gene ADIPOQ as instrumental variables. Eligible articles were identified from PubMed and Embase. Data and study quality were assessed in duplicate. Total 26 articles including 31 study groups were analyzed. Overall allelic association with cancer was significant for rs822396 (odds ratio (OR)&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.91; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.045) and rs1501299 (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.89; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.051), with low or moderate heterogeneity. Carriers of rs2241766 GG genotype (weighted mean difference (WMD)&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.86; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.037) or G allele (WMD&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.68; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.047) had significantly higher circulating adiponectin than the TT genotype carriers, without heterogeneity. Using rs2241766 as an instrument in Mendelian randomization analysis, an increment of 1 mg/L in circulating adiponectin was significantly associated with a 43-50% reduced risk for lung cancer, but with a 20-40% increased risk of colorectal cancer, respectively. There was no observable publication bias. Genetically elevated circulating adiponectin might confer a protective effect against lung cancer, yet a risky effect for colorectal cancer. Further validation is urgently required.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the effect of various dietary fatty acids on pro- and anti-inflammatory processes. We investigated the effect of 5 oils containing various amounts of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), linoleic acid (LA), oleic acid (OA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on plasma inflammatory biomarkers and expression levels of key inflammatory genes and transcription factors in whole blood cells. In a randomized, crossover controlled nutrition intervention, 114 adult men and women with abdominal obesity and at least one other criterion for the metabolic syndrome consumed 5 experimental isoenergetic diets for 4 weeks each, separated by 4-week washout periods. Each diet provided 60 g/3000 kcal of different oils: 1) control corn/safflower oil blend (CornSaff; LA-rich), 2) flax/safflower oil blend (FlaxSaff; ALA-rich), 3) conventional canola oil (Canola; OA-rich), 4) high oleic canola oil (CanolaOleic; highest OA content), 5) DHA-enriched high oleic canola oil (CanolaDHA; OA- and DHA-rich). Gene expression in whole blood cells was assessed in a subset of 62 subjects. CanolaDHA increased plasma adiponectin concentrations compared with the control CornSaff oil treatment (+4.5%, P = 0.04) and FlaxSaff (+6.9%, P = 0.0008). CanolaDHA also reduced relative expression levels of interleukin (IL)1B compared with CornSaff and Canola (-11% and -13%, respectively, both P = 0.03). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentrations were lower after Canola than after FlaxSaff (-17.8%, P = 0.047). DHA-enriched canola oil exerts anti-inflammatory effects compared with polyunsaturated fatty acids from plant sources.",

    "title": "Association of ADIPOQ polymorphisms with obesity risk: a meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "The association between ADIPOQ polymorphisms and the risk of obesity remains controversial. We perform a comprehensive meta-analysis to clarify the current understanding of this association. We searched for relevant studies in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane library before February 2014. The strengths of the association between ADIPOQ polymorphisms and obesity risk were estimated by odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Eighteen case-control studies analyzing four SNPs (rs17300539, rs266729, rs1501299 and rs2241766) of ADIPOQ gene were eligible for the present meta-analysis. The pooling results showed that rs17300539 (2GG+GA vs. 2AA+GA: OR=0.78, 95%CI=0.69-0.89) and rs1501299 (2GG+GA vs. 2AA+GA: OR=0.89, 95%CI=0.80-0.98) were associated with obesity risk in Caucasian ethnicity. The rs266729 were associated with obesity risk in Asian ethnicity (2CC+CG vs. 2GG+GCG: OR=0.77, 95%CI=0.65-0.92). However, there were no associations between rs2241766 and the obesity risk (P&gt;0.05). No publication bias was found among these studies (all P&gt;0.05). This study suggests that ADIPOQ rs17300539 and rs1501299 are associated with risk of obesity in Caucasian ethnicity, and the rs266729 is associated with obesity risk in Asian ethnicity. However, there is no association between rs2241766 and obesity risk.",

    "abstract": "The amount of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) around the heart has been identified as an independent predictor of coronary artery disease (CAD), potentially through local release of inflammatory cytokines. Ethnic differences have been observed, but no studies have investigated this relationship in the Mexican population. The objective of the present study was to evaluate whether a relationship exist between EAT thickness assessed via echocardiography with CAD and adiponectin levels in a Mexican population. We studied 153 consecutive patients who underwent coronary angiography and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). EAT thickness on the free wall of the right ventricle was measured at the end of systole from parasternal long and short axis views of three consecutive cardiac cycles. Coronary angiograms were analyzed for the presence, extent and severity of CAD. Serum adiponectin, lipids, glucose, C-reactive protein and fibrinogen were determined. EAT thickness was greater in patients with CAD than in those without CAD from both parasternal long (5.39 &#xb1; 1.75 mm vs 4.00 &#xb1; 1.67 mm p&lt;0.0001) and short-axis views (5.23 &#xb1; 1.67 vs 4.12 &#xb1; 1.77, p=0.001). EAT thickness measured from parasternal long and short-axis showed a statistically significant positive correlation with age (r=0.354, p&lt;0.001; r=0.286, p&lt;0.001 respectively), and waist circumference (r=0.189, p=0.019; r=0.217, p=0.007 respectively). A significant negative correlation between EAT thickness from the parasternal long axis with cholesterol-HDL was observed (r=-0.163, p=0.045). No significant correlation was found between epicardial fat thickness and serum adiponectin or with the severity of CAD. EAT thickness was greater in patients with CAD. However, no correlation was observed with the severity of the disease or with serum adiponectin levels. EAT thickness measured by echocardiography might provide additional information for risk assessment and prediction of CAD.",

    "abstract": "Moderate alcohol consumption exerts a cardioprotective effect, but no studies have evaluated the alcohol-independent cardiovascular effects of the non-alcoholic components of beer. We aimed to evaluate the effects of ethanol and the phenolic compounds of beer on classical and novel cardiovascular risk factors. Thirty-three high risk male volunteers were included in a randomized, crossover feeding trial. After a washout period, all subjects received beer (30 g alcohol/d, 660 mL), the equivalent amount of polyphenols as non-alcoholic beer (990 mL), and gin (30 g alcohol/d, 100 mL) for 4 weeks. All outcomes were evaluated before and after each intervention period. Moderate alcohol consumption increased serum HDL-cholesterol (&#x223c;5%), ApoA-I (&#x223c;6%), ApoA-II (&#x223c;7%) and adiponectin (&#x223c;7%), and decreased serum fibrinogen (&#x223c;8%), and interleukin (IL)-5 (&#x223c;14%) concentrations, whereas the non-alcoholic fraction of beer (mainly polyphenols) increased the receptor antagonist of IL-1 (&#x223c;24%), and decreased lymphocyte expression of lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (&#x223c;11%), lymphocyte and monocyte expression of Sialil-Lewis X (&#x223c;16%) and monocyte expression of CCR2 (&#x223c;31%), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x3b2; (&#x223c;14%) and IL-15 (&#x223c;22%) plasma concentrations. No changes were observed in glucose metabolism parameters or in body weight and adiposity parameters. The phenolic content of beer reduces leukocyte adhesion molecules and inflammatory biomarkers, whereas alcohol mainly improves the lipid profile and reduces some plasma inflammatory biomarkers related to atherosclerosis.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression studies of subcutaneous adipose tissue may help to better understand the mechanisms behind body fat changes in HIV-infected patients who initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART). Here, we evaluated early changes in adipose tissue gene expression and their relationship to fat changes in ART-naive HIV-infected patients randomly assigned to initiate therapy with emtricitabine/tenofovir plus efavirenz (EFV) or ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r). Patients had abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies at baseline and week 16 and dual-energy-X-ray absorptiometry at baseline and weeks 16 and 48. mRNA changes of 11 genes involved in adipogenesis, lipid and glucose metabolism, mitochondrial energy, and inflammation were assessed through reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Additionally, correlations between gene expression changes and fat changes were evaluated. Fat increased preferentially in the trunk with EFV and in the limbs with LPV/r (P &lt; 0.05). After 16 weeks of exposure to the drug regimen, transcripts of CEBP/A, ADIPOQ, GLUT4, LPL, and COXIV were significantly down-regulated in the EFV arm compared to the LPV/r arm (P &lt; 0.05). Significant correlations were observed between LPL expression change and trunk fat change at week 16 in both arms and between CEBP/A or COXIV change and trunk fat change at the same time point only in the EFV arm and not in the LPV/r arm. When combined with emtricitabine/tenofovir as standard backbone therapy, EFV and LPV/r induced differential early expression of genes involved in adipogenesis and energy metabolism. Moreover, these mRNA expression changes correlated with trunk fat change in the EFV arm.

SNP rs2241766 was found significantly associated with T2D risk in the additive model, dominant model and recessive model. A marginal association was detected for SNP rs1501299 in the additive model and recessive model after Bonferroni correction, and haplotype analysis provided additional evidence supporting the association between these two SNPs and T2D risk. A meta-analysis including 29 published datasets along with current dataset was next carried out to further confirm the association. In consistent with our case/control results, rs2241766 showed a significant association with T2D in the dominant model and additive model, and the association between rs1501299 and T2D was also characterized in the homozygote model, dominant model, recessive model, and additive model. Of note, the association became much stronger in East Asians after exclusion of ethnic stratification. Together, our data support that the rs2241766 and rs1501299 polymorphisms within the ADIPOQ gene confer genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes, especially in the Chinese Han population.",

The treatment group received two MorDHA&#xae; capsules per day (each capsule contain 465 mg of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and 63 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)) for 14 months while the control group received placebo capsules with similar color, shape, and taste. Leptin and adiponectin concentrations in plasma were measured at the beginning of trial and then after 6 and 14 months. Fourteen months of treatment with DHA and EPA did not influence concentrations of leptin but adiponectin level was significantly decreased (P: 0.03). Weight was positively correlated with leptin level at stage 0 of trial (P: 0.008, r=0.41) while this association was attenuated through stages of trial after intervention. Our data show that omega-3 fatty acids may not affect plasma concentrations of leptin but adiponectin level is decreased in patients with SCI. Moreover, this intervention influences the linear relationship between weight and leptin after 14 months administration of DHA and EPA.",

    "title": "Obesity in autoimmune diseases: not a passive bystander.",
    "abstract": "In the last decades, autoimmune diseases have experienced a dramatic increase in Western countries. The involvement of environmental factors is strongly suspected to explain this rise. Particularly, over the same period, obesity has followed the same outbreak. Since the exciting discovery of the secretory properties of adipose tissue, the relationship between obesity and autoimmunity and the understanding of the underlying mechanisms have become of major interest. Indeed, the fat tissue has been found to produce a wide variety of adipokines, involved in the regulation of numerous physiological functions, including the immune response. By conducting a systematic literature review, we extracted 329 articles regarding clinical, experimental and pathophysiological data on the relationship between obesity, adipokines - namely leptin, adiponectin, resistin, visfatin - and various immune-mediated conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), multiple sclerosis (MS), type-1 diabetes (T1D), psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and thyroid autoimmunity (TAI), especially Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT). The strongest levels of evidence support an increased risk of RA (OR=1.2-3.4), MS (OR=2), psoriasis and PsA (OR=1.48-6.46) in obese subjects. A higher risk of IBD, T1D and TAI is also suggested. Moreover, obesity worsens the course of RA, SLE, IBD, psoriasis and PsA, and impairs the treatment response of RA, IBD, psoriasis and PsA. Extensive clinical data and experimental models demonstrate the involvement of adipokines in the pathogenesis of these autoimmune diseases. Obesity appears to be a major environmental factor contributing to the onset and progression of autoimmune diseases.",

    "abstract": "Muscle and fat are now recognized as metabolism-regulating endocrine organs. However, muscle and adipocyte-derived novel cytokines such as irisin and omentin-1 remain understudied in relation to metabolic biomarkers that are associated with cardiovascular risk. Thirty-nine subjects with mean (&#xb1; SD) BMI of 29.2 &#xb1; 5.4 kg/m(2) and either diabetes or two other cardiovascular risk factors were enrolled in a 6-month randomized trial of low-dose ethanol. We examined cross-sectional data at baseline, 3-month, and 6-month visits to assess (1) within-person stability of novel cytokines (irisin, omentin-1, visfatin, resistin, and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor II) and (2) their associations with metabolic parameters, particularly lipoprotein subparticle profile. Repeated measures of irisin and omentin-1 were highly correlated, with intra-class correlations of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.91; P &lt; 0.001) and 0.81 (0.70, 0.89; P &lt; 0.001), respectively. Irisin was negatively correlated with omentin-1 (7.4% irisin decrease per a 1-SD increment in omentin-1; 95% CI: 0.5%, 13.9%; P = 0.04). In models adjusted for age, sex, and race, irisin was negatively associated with HDL cholesterol (7.3% decrease per a 10mg/dL increment; 1.0%, 13.3%; P = 0.02) and large HDL particles (15.5% decrease per a 1-SD or 3.5-&#x3bc;mol/L increment; 5.2%, 24.7%; P=0.005). Omentin-1 was positively associated with mean VLDL size (3.8% increase per a 1-SD increment; 0.06%, 7.8%; P = 0.05). Adjustment for alcohol intervention, BMI, and other cytokines did not materially affect these associations. Irisin and omentin-1 are stable within-person, inversely associated with each other, and closely related to lipoprotein profile. These molecules may be promising markers for cardiovascular risk.",

    "abstract": "Long-term physical activity is reported to improve chronic systemic inflammation, which provides protection against the ensuing development of chronic disease. Accordingly, the present study assessed changes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, aerobic capacity and body composition following 8 weeks of either small-sided games (SSG) or cycling (CYC) training compared to a sedentary control (CON) condition. Thirty-three middle-aged, sedentary men were randomized into CYC (n = 11), SSG (n = 11), or CON (n = 11) conditions. The CYC and SSG conditions trained 3 days/week for 8 weeks, whilst CON maintained habitual activity and dietary patterns. Pre- and post-intervention testing included a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan, sub-maximal (80% maximal heart rate) aerobic capacity (VO&#x2082;) and fasting venous blood. Venous blood measures for pro-inflammatory markers included C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1&#x3b2;, tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1;, and leptin; anti-inflammatory markers included IL-10, IL-1 receptor agonist, and adiponectin. Both CYC and SSG increased submaximal power output and VO&#x2082; (P &lt; 0.05), decreased total body fat-mass (TB-FM; P &lt; 0.05), and CRP (SSG, -0.45 &#xb1; 0.42 mg L(-1); P = 0.008; CYC, -0.44 &#xb1; 0.59 mg L(-1); P = 0.02). Only SSG increased total body fat-free mass (TB-FFM; +1.1 &#xb1; 1.2 kg; P = 0.001) and decreased concentration of plasma IL-6 (-0.69 &#xb1; 0.62 pg mL(-1); P = 0.002) and leptin (-2,212 &#xb1; 2,531 ng mL(-1); P = 0.014). Cycling and SSG training were both effective at improving CRP, VO&#x2082; and TB-FM. Furthermore, SSG training has also shown to be an effective training approach in reducing IL-6 and leptin and increasing muscle mass within sedentary, middle-aged men.",

    "abstract": "A common single-nucleotide polymorphism identified in the 5'-untranslated region of the leptin gene (LEP -2548 G/A polymorphism) may be associated with obesity, but the existing research findings are inconsistent, so we conducted this meta-analysis. Medline, Embase and ISI Web of Science databases were searched to identify relevant studies. Meta-analysis of the total and subgroup populations was conducted using allelic, additive, dominant and recessive models, and odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated in a fixed-effect model if no heterogeneity (evaluated as I(2) statistic) existed. Otherwise, a random-effects model was adopted. Subgroup analysis was performed by ethnicity. Meta-regression and the HETRED analysis were used to explore the potential sources of between-study heterogeneity. Egger's test and influence analysis were conducted to evaluate the publication bias and study power, respectively. The final selection enrolled 9 studies, including 2,988 subjects (1,372 obese subjects and 1,616 controls). No significant association was identified between the LEP -2548 G/A polymorphism and obesity for all genetic models in the overall population and Caucasians. We found a significant association with allelic, additive and dominant models for subjects of mixed race from South America. Notwithstanding, this significance should be treated cautiously for it is based on a rather small sample (788 involved subjects). In total, the combined analysis of data from current and published studies suggested that the LEP -2548 G/A polymorphism does not contribute to the development of obesity, despite the fact that a significant association exists in a small subgroup from South America. Further studies are needed to elucidate the relationship. .",

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies to evaluate the overall quantitative estimates on the adiponectin levels for risk of mortality in patients with CVD. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library (up to Mar 22, 2014) were used to search for studies evaluating the effect of adiponectin levels on mortality in patients with CVD. Random-effect models were selected to estimate overall effect estimates. Data from 14063 CVD patients enrolled in 15 prospective cohort and 1 nested case control studies were collated. The meta-analyses showed strong positive association of adiponectin with all-cause (n=14 studies, overall pooled effect estimate=1.45 [95% CI, 1.17-1.79]) and cardiovascular (n=11 studies, overall pooled effect estimate=1.69 [1.35-2.10]) mortality, for the highest tertile of adiponectin levels versus the lowest tertile. Subgroup analyses show study characteristics (including effect estimate, mean age, study location, sample sizes, gender, durations of follow-up, types of primary event, and acute or chronic CVD) did not substantially influence these positive associations. Our results showed that increased baseline plasma adiponectin levels are significantly associated with elevated risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in subjects with CVD. These positive associations may have been amplified by adjustment for potential intermediates or residual confounding, and their basis requires further investigation.",

We also used heavy water to determine the turnover rates of glycosaminoglycans in synovial fluid. This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 40 subjects over a period of 3 months. Visual analog scale, Western Ontario McMaster pain, and WOMAC function scores were recorded. Serum and synovial fluid were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for inflammatory cytokines, bradykinin, and leptin. In 20 subjects, terminal heavy water ingestion was used for spectral analyses of serum and joint fluid samples. There were statistically significant improvements in pain and function. Both serum and synovial fluid samples showed significant decreases for a majority of inflammatory cytokines, leptin, and bradykinin in the oral hyaluronic acid preparation group. Heavy water analyses revealed a significant decrease in hyaluronic acid turnover in the synovial fluid of the treatment group. A preparation containing hyaluronic acid and other glycosaminoglycans holds promise for a safe and effective agent for the treatment for patients with knee osteoarthritis and who are overweight.

    "abstract": "The results from the published studies on the association between leptin (LEP) genetic polymorphism and cancer risk are conflicting. The common A19G (rs2167270) genetic polymorphism has been reported to be functional and may contribute to genetic susceptibility to cancers. However, the association between LEP A19G (rs2167270) genetic polymorphism and cancer risk remains inconclusive. To better understand the role of LEP A19G (rs2167270) genetic polymorphism in global cancer, we conducted this comprehensive meta-analysis encompassing 5,679 cases and 7,443 controls.

For non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, there was a significant association of LEP A19G (rs2167270) variant with the disease under homozygous codominant model [OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.74 (0.59-0.94)], recessive genetic model [OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.76 (0.61-0.94)], and additive genetic model [OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.89 (0.80-0.99)], but not under heterozygous codominant model [OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.95 (0.82-1.10)] and dominant genetic model [OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.91 (0.79-1.04)]. Moreover, a significantly decreased cancer risk was found in recessive genetic model among Latin American population. When stratified by study design, significantly elevated susceptibility to cancer was not found among any studies. No significantly differences in genotype method and sample size in cases were found among genotypes. These findings suggest that the LEP A19G (rs2167270) genetic polymorphism may decrease the susceptibility to cancers in colorectal cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, when assuming a homozygote codominant model and a recessive genetic model among Latin American population. The phenomenon also indicates that the SNP functions as a recessive mutation, which needs to be verified or linked with functional studies.",

However, the results are inconsistent. Electronic literature databases and reference lists of relevant articles published until December 2013 were searched as part of a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the association between adiponectin gene polymorphisms and DN susceptibility in T2DM. Fixed- or random-effects models were used to calculate the effect sizes of odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Eleven case control studies were included. Overall, a significant association was observed for rs2241766T/G polymorphisms under the recessive model (GG vs. TT+TG: OR 1.75; 95% CI 1.09-2.80; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02).

Women with PCOS present elevated plasma insulin levels, both fasting and after a glucose load, as an indirect evidence of insulin resistance. PCOS women may also present hypertension, low levels of HDL cholesterol, hypertriglyceridemia, visceral obesity and a higher level of CRP and fibrinogen that can predict an atherosclerotic risk. This study was carried out on 15 young women with PCOS selected according to the 2003 diagnostic criteria of The Rotterdam Consensus Statement and 15 Control women. PCOS women were treated with pioglitazone 30 mg/day and at the beginning and after 6 months of treatment were evaluated: menstrual cycle trend, hirsutism and acne, total cholesterolemia and HDL, triglyceridemia, fibrinogenemia, C-reactive protein, oral glucose tolerance test, glycated hemoglobin, FSH, LH, 17OH-progesterone, 17&#x3b2;-estradiol, free and total testosterone, SHBG, DHEA-S, &#x394;4-androstenedione and adiponectin. Treatment with pioglitazone improves the irregularities of menses and hirsutism.

    "abstract": "Prediction of radiographic progression (RP) in early rheumatoid arthritis (eRA) would be very useful for optimal choice among available therapies. We evaluated a multi-biomarker disease activity (MBDA) score, based on 12 serum biomarkers as a baseline predictor for 1-year RP in eRA. Baseline disease activity score based on erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR), disease activity score based on C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP), CRP, MBDA scores and DAS28-ESR at 3&#x2005;months were analysed for 235 patients with eRA from the Swedish Farmacotherapy (SWEFOT) clinical trial. RP was defined as an increase in the Van der Heijde-modified Sharp score by more than five points over 1&#x2005;year. Associations between baseline disease activity measures, the MBDA score, and 1-year RP were evaluated using univariate and multivariate logistic regression, adjusted for potential confounders. Among 235 patients with eRA, 5 had low and 29 moderate MBDA scores at baseline. None of the former and only one of the latter group (3.4%) had RP during 1&#x2005;year, while the proportion of patients with RP among those with high MBDA score was 20.9% (p=0.021). Among patients with low/moderate CRP, moderate DAS28-CRP or moderate DAS28-ESR at baseline, progression occurred in 14%, 15%, 14% and 15%, respectively. MBDA score was an independent predictor of RP as a continuous (OR=1.05, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.08) and dichotomised variable (high versus low/moderate, OR=3.86, 95% CI 1.04 to 14.26). In patients with eRA, the MBDA score at baseline was a strong independent predictor of 1-year RP. These results suggest that when choosing initial treatment in eRA the MBDA test may be clinically useful to identify a subgroup of patients at low risk of RP.

    "abstract": "Inflammation plays a major role in diabetes-associated cardiovascular disease (CVD). There is uncertainty whether diet and physical activity interventions can be successfully integrated into healthcare settings and reduce markers of inflammation and risk of CVD in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Systemic markers of inflammation were determined in a 12-month, real-world, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial that investigated the effect of diet, diet plus physical activity, and usual care in 593 individuals with newly diagnosed T2D. During the first 6 months, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) improved by -21 (-36 to -1.4)% and -22 (-38 to -3.1)% in diet and diet plus physical activity arms versus usual care. There were also improvements in adiponectin and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1). Though medication-adjusted CRP was improved between 6 and 12 months for usual care, both interventions were more successful in reducing the relative risk of a high-risk CRP level of &gt;3 mg/L (risk ratios of 0.72 [0.55 to 0.95] for diet versus usual care and 0.67 [0.50 to 0.90] for diet plus activity versus usual care). Furthermore, sICAM-1 (a marker of vascular risk), remained substantially lower than usual care in both intervention arms at 12 months. Motivational, unsupervised diet and/or diet plus physical activity interventions given soon after diagnosis in real-world healthcare settings improve markers of inflammation and cardiovascular risk in patients with T2D, even after accounting for the effect of adjustments to medication to try and control blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin, and lipids. http://www.controlled-trials.com/.

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have suggested the importance of leptin against autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis (MS) and psoriasis. To summarize our current understanding of the role of leptin in inflammatory responses and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a systematic review was conducted to assess the discrepancy of leptin in RA and its effect on immunity according to different studies. Recently, emerging data have indicated that leptin is involved in the pathological function of RA, which is common in autoimmune disorders. This review discusses the possible consequences of leptin levels in RA. Blocking the key signal pathways of leptin and inhibiting the leptin activity-like leptin antagonist may be a promising way for potential therapeutic treatment of RA at risk of detrimental effects. However, leptin was increased in patients with RA and may also regulate joint damage. Thus, more understanding of the mechanism of leptin in RA would be advantageous in the future.",

Multiple studies have assessed the association between rs2241766 polymorphism in the adiponectin (ADIPOQ) gene and obesity susceptibility. However, the results are inconsistent and inconclusive. The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate this association in adults. Several electronic databases were searched for relevant literature published up to November 2013. Statistical analyses were performed using software Review Manager (Version 5.02) and STATA (Version 10.0). The pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with a random-effects model or a fixed-effect model depending on heterogeneity among studies. Q tests and Egger's tests were performed to assess heterogeneity and publication bias. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to confirm the reliability and stability of the meta-analysis. A total of 2,819 obese and 3,024 controls in 18 case-control studies were included in the meta-analysis. The results indicated that compared with TT genotype, the ADIPOQ-rs2241766 GG genotype was associated with an increased risk for obesity (OR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.11-1.73, P for heterogeneity = 0.520, I2 = 0%) in overall studies. Whereas, GT genotype was associated with a borderland increased risk for obesity (OR = 1.13, 95% CI: 0.94-1.36, P for heterogeneity = 0.006, I2 = 51%). The susceptibility of obesity was increased based on genotypes of TT&lt;GT&lt;GG (P for trend = 0.011). Subgroup analysis of different regions revealed that the ADIPOQ-rs2241766 GG genotype increased obesity risk in the Chinese studies (OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.19-2.00) but not in the non-Chinese studies (OR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.66-1.58). Similar results were observed in allelic, recessive, and dominant genetic models. There was no significant evidence of publication bias in the overall, Chinese, and non-Chinese studies (P = 0.426, P = 0.935, and P = 0.390, respectively). The results of this meta-analysis suggest that the ADIPOQ-rs2241766 G/T polymorphism might be associated with obesity in Chinese studies but not in non-Chinese studies in adults. Better-designed studies that consider confounding factors and assess larger sample sizes with a focus on ADIPOQ-rs2241766G/T polymorphisms and obesity are required in the future.",

    "abstract": "Sex hormones strongly influence body fat distribution and adipocyte differentiation. Estrogens and testosterone differentially affect adipocyte physiology, but the importance of estrogens in the development of metabolic diseases during menopause is disputed. Estrogens and estrogen receptors regulate various aspects of glucose and lipid metabolism. Disturbances of this metabolic signal lead to the development of metabolic syndrome and a higher cardiovascular risk in women. The absence of estrogens is a clue factor in the onset of cardiovascular disease during the menopausal period, which is characterized by lipid profile variations and predominant abdominal fat accumulation. However, influence of the absence of these hormones and its relationship to higher obesity in women during menopause are not clear. This systematic review discusses of the role of estrogens and estrogen receptors in adipocyte differentiation, and its control by the central nervous systemn and the possible role of estrogen-like compounds and endocrine disruptors chemicals are discussed. Finally, the interaction between the decrease in estrogen secretion and the prevalence of obesity in menopausal women is examined. We will consider if the absence of estrogens have a significant effect of obesity in menopausal women.",

Insulin resistance was measured by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR). The AT + RT group showed better results with regard to decreased body fat mass, low-density lipoprotein concentration (LDL-c) levels, subcutaneous and visceral fat and increased body lean mass. Indeed, a reduction of hyperleptinaemia and an increase in adiponectin concentrations, promoting an improvement in the leptin/adiponectin ratio, was observed. Important clinical parameters were improved in both types of exercise; however, AT + RT was more effective in improving the visceral adiposity, metabolic profile and inflammatory markers than AT alone, suggesting clinical applications for the control of intra-abdominal obesity and cardiovascular risk in the paediatric population.",

With this in mind, this meta-analysis was performed in an attempt to draw a more precise conclusion regarding the association between ADIPOQ polymorphisms and cancer risk. In this study, with a total of 19 eligible articles consisting of 52 studies, the pooled odds ratios (ORs) for the association between ADIPOQ rs1501299 and cancer risk were statistically significant (dominant model, TT/GT vs. GG, OR=0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.77-0.92; homozygous model, TT vs. GG, OR=0.80, 95% CI: 0.68-0.94). These results suggested that ADIPOQ rs1501299 might be a protection-associated polymorphism in cancer. The stratified analyses indicated that the variant T allele of ADIPOQ rs1501299 was associated with decreased risk of cancer in both Caucasian and Asian populations when compared with the G allele. No significant association for the rest of the polymorphisms was observed under any genetic model. This meta-analysis suggests that the ADIPOQ rs1501299 may be a protective factor for carcinogenesis.",

    "title": "Comprehensive analysis of circulating adipokines and hsCRP association with cardiovascular disease risk factors and metabolic syndrome in Arabs.",
    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are a leading cause of death worldwide including the Middle East. This is caused in part by the dysregulation of adipose tissue leading to increased production of pro-inflammatory adipokines and reduction in cardio-protective adipokines such as adiponectin. Ethnicity has been recognized as a major factor in the association between CVD risk factors and the different circulating adipokines. In this study, for the first time, the relationship between traditional cardiovascular risk factors, Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) and circulating level of adipokines in Arab ethnicity was investigated. We conducted a population-based cross-sectional survey on 379 adult Arab participants living in Kuwait. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure (BP), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglyceride (TG) were measured. Plasma levels of circulating Leptin, Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor (PAI-1) visfatin, adiponectin, resistin and adipsin were assessed using the multiplexing immunobead-based assay. Circulating levels of High sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP), Leptin, PAI-1 and adiponectin were significantly higher in Arab women than men (p &lt; 0.0001). In multi-variate analysis, the homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and body mass index (BMI) showed strong association with most of the biomarkers (p &lt; 0.05). HsCRP showed significant association with all risk factors (p &lt; 0.05). Leptin, PAI-1 and adipsin showed significant positive correlation with BMI, unlike adiponectin which showed inverse correlation (p &lt; 0.05). Subjects in the highest tertile of leptin, PAI-1 and hsCRP had higher odds of having Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) (odd ratio [OR] = 3.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.47-6.19) and (OR = 2.52, 95% CI = 1.45-4.35), (OR = 4.26, 95% CI = 2.39-7.59) respectively. On the other hand subjects with highest tertile of adiponectin had lower odds of having MetS (OR = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.12-0.40). Leptin, PAI-1 and hsCRP showed significant positive association with increased MetS components (P-trend &lt;0.05), while adiponectin was negatively associated with increased MetS components (P-trend &lt;0.0001). Our results show positive association between hsCRP, leptin, PAI-1 with increased MetS components and increase the odds of having MetS. Adiponectin on the other hand showed inverse correlation with MetS components and associated with reduction in MetS. Overall, our data highlights the significant clinical value these markers have in MetS especially hsCRP which can be used as good marker of low grade inflammation in Arabs.",

    "title": "Evaluation of yellow pea fibre supplementation on weight loss and the gut microbiota: a randomized controlled trial.",
    "abstract": "Fibre intake among North Americans is currently less than half the recommended amount. Consumers are interested in food products that could promote weight loss and improve health. Consequently, evaluation of unique fibre sources with potential gut-mediated benefits for metabolic health warrants investigation. Our objective is to assess the effects of yellow pea fibre supplementation on weight loss and gut microbiota in an overweight and obese adult population. In a double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study, overweight and obese (BMI = 25-38) adults will be randomized to either a 15 g/d yellow pea fibre supplemented group or isocaloric placebo group for 12 weeks (n = 30/group). The primary outcome measure is a change in body fat from baseline to 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes include glucose tolerance, appetite regulation, serum lipids and inflammatory markers. Anthropometric data (height, weight, BMI, and waist circumference) and food intake (by 3-day weighed food records) will be measured at baseline and every 4 weeks thereafter. Subjective ratings of appetite will be recorded by participants at home on a weekly basis using validated visual analogue scales. At week 0 and at the end of the study (week 12), an ad libitum lunch buffet protocol for objective food intake measures and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan for body composition will be completed. Participants will be instructed not to change their exercise habits during the 12 week study. Glucose and insulin will be measured during an oral glucose tolerance test at weeks 0 and 12. Levels of lipids and CRP will be measured and inflammatory markers (adiponectin, leptin, TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-6 and IL-8) in the serum will be quantified using Milliplex kits. Mechanisms related to changes in gut microbiota, serum and fecal water metabolomics will be assessed. Globally the development of functional foods and functional food ingredients are critically needed to curb the rise in metabolic disease. This project will assess the potential of yellow pea fibre to improve weight control via gut-mediated changes in metabolic health in overweight and obese adults.

    "title": "A randomized trial of sodium-restriction on kidney function, fluid volume and adipokines in CKD patients.",
    "abstract": "Dietary sodium restriction is a key management strategy in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recent evidence has demonstrated short-term reduction in blood pressure (BP) and proteinuria with sodium restriction, however the effect on other cardiovascular-related risk factors requires investigation in CKD. The LowSALT CKD study involved 20 hypertensive Stage III-IV CKD patients counselled by a dietitian to consume a low-sodium diet (&lt;100&#xa0;mmol/day). The study was a randomised crossover trial comparing 2&#xa0;weeks of high-sodium (additional 120&#xa0;mmol sodium tablets) and low-sodium intake (placebo). Measurements were taken after each crossover arm including BP (peripheral and central), adipokines (inflammation markers and adiponectin), volume markers (extracellular-to-intracellular [E/I] fluid ratio; N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP]), kidney function (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate [eGFR]) and proteinuria (urine protein-creatinine ratio [PCR] and albumin-creatinine ratio [ACR]). Outcomes were compared using paired t-test for each cross-over arm. BP-lowering benefits of a low-sodium intake (peripheral BP (mean&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;SD) 148/82&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;21/12&#xa0;mmHg) from high-sodium (159/87&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;15/10&#xa0;mmHg) intake were reflected in central BP and a reduction in eGFR, PCR, ACR, NTproBNP and E/I ratio. There was no change in inflammatory markers, total or high molecular weight adiponectin. Short-term benefits of sodium restriction on BP were reflected in significant change in kidney function and fluid volume parameters. Larger, long-term adequately powered trials in CKD are necessary to confirm these results.

    "abstract": "Plasma adiponectin levels are reduced in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and other insulin-resistant states. We examined whether plasma adiponectin levels at baseline and after pioglitazone treatment in impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) subjects were associated with improved insulin sensitivity (SI) and glucose tolerance status. A total of 602 high-risk IGT subjects in ACT NOW were randomized to receive pioglitazone or placebo with a median follow-up of 2.4 years. Pioglitazone reduced IGT conversion to diabetes by 72% in association with improved &#x3b2;-cell function by 64% (insulin secretion/insulin resistance index) and increased tissue sensitivity by 88% (Matsuda index). In pioglitazone-treated subjects, plasma adiponectin concentration increased threefold from 13 &#xb1; 0.5 to 38 &#xb1; 2.5 &#x3bc;g/mL (P &lt; 0.001) and was strongly correlated with the improvement in SI (r = 0.436, P &lt; 0.001) and modestly correlated with glucose area under the curve during oral glucose tolerance test (r = 0.238, P &lt; 0.005) and insulin secretion/insulin resistance index (r = 0.306, P &lt; 0.005). The increase in adiponectin was a strong predictor of reversion to normal glucose tolerance and prevention of T2DM. In the placebo group, plasma adiponectin did not change and was not correlated with changes in glucose levels. There was an inverse association between baseline plasma adiponectin concentration and progression to diabetes in the placebo group but not in the pioglitazone group. Baseline adiponectin does not predict the response to pioglitazone. The increase in plasma adiponectin concentration after pioglitazone therapy in IGT subjects is strongly related to improved glucose tolerance status and enhanced tissue sensitivity to insulin.",

    "abstract": "Investigating the effects of lipid-lowering drugs on HDL subclasses has shown ambiguous results. This study assessed the effects of ezetimibe, simvastatin, and their combination on HDL subclass distribution. A single-center randomized parallel 3-group open-label study was performed in 72 healthy men free of cardiovascular disease with a baseline LDL-cholesterol of 111&#xb1;30 mg/dl (2.9&#xb1;0.8 mmol/l) and a baseline HDL-cholesterol of 64&#xb1;15 mg/dl (1.7&#xb1;0.4 mmol/l). They were treated with ezetimibe (10 mg/day, n&#x200a;=&#x200a;24), simvastatin (40 mg/day, n&#x200a;=&#x200a;24) or their combination (n&#x200a;=&#x200a;24) for 14 days. Blood was drawn before and after the treatment period. HDL subclasses were determined using polyacrylamide gel-tube electrophoresis. Multivariate regression models were used to determine the influence of treatment and covariates on changes in HDL subclass composition. Baseline HDL subclasses consisted of 33&#xb1;10% large, 48&#xb1;6% intermediate and 19&#xb1;8% small HDL. After adjusting for baseline HDL subclass distribution, body mass index, LDL-C and the ratio triglycerides/HDL-C, there was a significant increase in large HDL by about 3.9 percentage points (P&lt;0.05) and a decrease in intermediate HDL by about 3.5 percentage points (P&lt;0.01) in both simvastatin-containing treatment arms in comparison to ezetimibe. The parameters obtained after additional adjustment for the decrease in LDL-C indicated that about one third to one half of these effects could be explained by the extent of LDL-C-lowering. In healthy men, treatment with simvastatin leads to favorable effects on HDL subclass composition, which was not be observed with ezetimibe. Part of these differential effects may be due to the stronger LDL-C-lowering effects of simvastatin. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00317993.",

    "title": "An elevated plasma level of visfatin increases the risk of myocardial infarction.",
    "abstract": "Visfatin, an adipocytokine involved in metabolic and immune disorders, plays an important role in the etiology of cardiovascular disease. Recent evidence has shown that an elevated plasma level of visfatin may increase the risk of myocardial infarction (MI), but individual published studies have shown inconclusive results. This study aimed to obtain a more precise estimate of the association between the plasma visfatin level and MI risk through a detailed meta-analysis of studies published in peer-reviewed journals. A literature search of articles published before May 1, 2013 was performed on the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and China BioMedicine databases. Crude standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Eleven case-control studies comprising 362 MI patients and 322 healthy controls were included. The meta-analysis revealed that an elevated plasma level of visfatin was associated with an increased risk of MI (SMD = 3.82, 95%CI = 2.67-4.98, P &lt; 0.001). Further stratification based on the source of the controls showed that an elevated plasma level of visfatin was significantly associated with increased risk of MI in both hospital-based and population-based studies (SMD = 4.12, 95%CI = 2.23-6.01, P &lt; 0.001 and SMD = 3.65, 95%CI = 2.67- 4.98, P &lt; 0.001, respectively). No publication bias was evident in this meta-analysis. In conclusion, the current meta-analysis indicates that an elevated plasma level of visfatin increases the risk of MI. Therefore, plasma visfatin may be a promising biomarker for the diagnosis of MI.",

No adverse effects attributable to pioglitazone were evident in the otherwise healthy obese cats at this dosage and duration. Results of this study support a positive effect of pioglitazone on insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism in obese cats, and suggest that further evaluation of the drug in cats with diabetes mellitus or other metabolic disorders might be warranted.",

In this study, we performed a meta-analysis to further investigate such an association. Articles that evaluate the effect of the T45G polymorphism on IR and blood glucose were identified from the PubMed and Embase databases. Five indices, including fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (F-insulin), 2-h blood glucose (2-h BG), 2-h insulin, and homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), were used to assess the effects of the T45G polymorphism on IR and blood glucose under a dominant model. 24 articles involving 7630 subjects were included. Twenty-two studies on FBG, 17 on F-insulin, 20 on HOMA-IR, and 3 on 2-h BG were included. No study on 2-h insulin was found. This meta-analysis revealed no significant association between the ADIPOQ T45G polymorphism and IR and blood glucose in the overall population and subgroup subjects under a dominant model, regardless of whether FBG, F-insulin, 2-h BG, or HOMA-IR was used. The present meta-analysis indicated that the mutation allele may have no function in IR development. The ADIPOQ T45G polymorphism is not associated with IR and blood glucose.",

The aim of this meta-analysis is to investigate the association between adiponectin polymorphisms and NAFLD risk. All eligible case-control studies published up to September 2013 were identified by searching PubMed, Web of Science, and CNKI. Effect sizes of odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated by using a fixed- or random-effect model. A total of 10 case-control studies were included; of those, there were nine studies (1223 cases and 1580 controls) for +45T&gt;G polymorphism, seven studies (876 cases and 989 controls) for +276G&gt;T polymorphism, and three studies (299 cases and 383 controls) for -11337C&gt;G polymorphism.

    "abstract": "Leptin, an adipose tissue-derived hormone, plays a central role in regulating human energy homeostasis. The role of leptin in regulating blood pressure, activating the sympathetic nervous system, insulin resistance, platelet aggregation, arterial thrombosis, angiogenesis, and inflammatory vascular responses suggests that leptin may have a close relationship with the development of coronary heart disease (CHD). However, no conclusive data are available to determine the association between leptin and CHD. The PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were surveyed for original studies describing the association between leptin and CHD outcome from the date of publication of each database through March 2013. The data were extracted by two investigators independently. The meta-analysis reported here was comprised of eight original articles with a total of 21,064 participants (10,842 men, 10,222 women) and 2053 CHD events. The odds ratio for the sociodemographic-adjusted study reported here was 1.57 (95% confidence interval, 1.14-2.16) and 1.72 (95% confidence internal, 1.03-2.87) in males and females, respectively. Further adjustment for additional cardiovascular risk factors resulted in an odds ratio of 1.36 (95% confidence interval, 0.98-1.88) in males and 1.50 (95% confidence interval, 0.93-2.42) in females. Sensitivity analysis restricted to sociodemographics-adjusted studies with high methodological quality indicated an estimate of 1.47 (95% confidence internal, 1.06-2.04) in males and 1.85 (95% confidence internal, 0.61-5.63) in females. Sensitivity analysis restricted to cardiovascular risk factor-adjusted studies showed no significant differences in both males and females. The results of the meta-analysis represents the most precise and accurate estimate of the relationship between leptin and CHD. Although the associations of leptin and CHD were not statistically significant both in male and female overall, males with high levels of leptin should be paid more attention to. Our findings highlight the need for additional well-designed and gender-specific prospective studies to evaluate the role of leptin on the development of CHD.",

Compared to healthy controls, RA patients had significantly higher leptin levels (SMD 1.19, 95 % CI 0.59-1.79). Subgroup analyses showed that region, race, age, body mass index (BMI), disease duration and disease activity were positively associated with plasma leptin levels in RA patients. Sensitivity analysis showed no significant change when any one study was excluded. Publication bias was also undetected. The present meta-analysis suggested that leptin levels were higher in RA patients than those in healthy controls, which may be subject to different region, race, age, BMI, disease duration and disease activity.",

A cross-over study, where 12 healthy young men received E. coli endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) 0.3 ng/kg at 12 noon and, on another day, at 12 midnight. Blood samples were analysed for pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines: tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, soluble TNF receptors (sTNF-R)-1 and -2, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), IL-6, and IL-10 as well as YKL-40 and the oxidative stress markers malondialdehyde (MDA), ascorbic acid (AA) and dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) before and at 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours after LPS administration. The levels of MDA and IL-10 where significantly higher during the day time (P&lt;0.05) whereas levels of TNF-alpha, sTNF-RI, sTNF-RII, IL-1Ra, IL-6, and YKL-40 were higher (P&lt;0.01 for all comparisons) during the night time. No significant differences were seen in the levels of AA and DHA. A day-night difference in the acute phase response to endotoxaemia exists in healthy volunteers with a more pronounced inflammatory response during the night time. This circadian difference in the response to endotoxaemia may play an important role in the clinical setting and should be investigated further.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topiroxostat in hyperuricemic stage 3 chronic kidney disease patients with or without gout. The study design was a 22-week, randomized, multicenter, double-blind study. The enrolled patients were randomly assigned to treatment with topiroxostat 160 mg/day (n = 62) or to the placebo (n = 61). The endpoints were the percent change in the serum urate level, change in the estimated glomerular filtration rate, the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, the proportion of patients with serum urate levels of 356.88 &#x3bc;mol/L or less, blood pressure, and serum adiponectin. After 22 weeks, although the changes in the estimated glomerular filtration rate and blood pressure were not significant, the percent change in the serum urate level (-45.38 vs. -0.08 %, P &lt; 0.0001) and the percent change in urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (-33.0 vs. -6.0 %, P = 0.0092) were found to have decreased in the topiroxostat as compared with the placebo. Although the incidence of 'alanine aminotransferase increased' was higher in the topiroxostat, serious adverse event rates were similar in the two groups. Topiroxostat 160 mg effectively reduced the serum urate level in the hyperuricemic stage 3 chronic kidney disease patients with or without gout.",

Peri-implant sulcus fluid was sampled from 32 patients in a randomized, clinical study comparing peri-implant defect re-construction with or without porous titanium granules. Matrix metalloproteinase 8 levels were measured using the Quantikine Human Total MMP-8 (DMP800) ELISA. Multianalyte profiling of the level of bone markers [interleukin-6, osteprotegerin (OPG), osteocalcin, leptin, osteopontin, parathyroid hormone, tumour necrosis factor-&#x3b1;, adiponectin and insulin] was performed by Luminex using Human Bone Panel IB. Changes in bone marker levels were compared and correlation with clinical findings was tested. No differences in clinical parameter or bone marker levels between test and control group were found. When comparing bone marker levels irrespective of treatment allocation between baseline and 12 months, a significant reduction in total protein, matrix metalloproteinase -8, interleukin-6, OPG, leptin and adiponectin were demonstrated. Positive correlations were found between the reduction in interleukin-6 (r = 0.43), insulin (r = 0.38) and matrix metalloproteinase-8 (r = 0.47) concentration, and probing pocket depth reduction. Peri-implantitis surgical treatment induced some reduction of the studied bone markers. Conclusive evidence for correlation between change in bone marker concentrations with disease resolution was not found.",

    "title": "Colon epithelial proliferation and carcinogenesis in diet-induced obesity.",
    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death in Japan and the United States and is strongly associated with obesity, especially visceral obesity. Several metabolic mediators, such as adiponectin, have been suspected to play a role in obesity-related carcinogenesis. In a previous human study, the existence of a significant correlation between the number of human dysplastic aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and the visceral fat area was demonstrated, and also that of a significant inverse correlation between the number of dysplastic ACF and the plasma adiponectin level. Other studies have investigated the effect of adiponectin under the normal and high-fat diet conditions in a mouse model of azoxymethane-induced colon cancer. Enhanced formation of both ACF and tumors was observed in the adiponectin-deficient mice, as compared with that in the wild-type, under the high-fat diet condition but not under the normal diet condition. Furthermore, that the 5'-AMP-activated kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway is involved in the promotion of colorectal carcinogenesis in adiponectin-deficient mice under the high-fat diet condition was shown. Therefore, that the 5'-AMP-activated kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway may play an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis was speculated. Metformin, a biguanide derivative widely used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus, has been shown to exert a suppressive effect on ACF formation in both mouse models and humans. Therefore, metformin might be a promising candidate as a safe drug for chemoprevention of colorectal carcinogenesis. Further studies with high evidence levels, such as randomized, controlled studies, are needed to clarify these relationships.",

    "abstract": "Resistance training (RT) had a positive effect on musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and type 2 diabetes disease. Knowing about the influence of different types of RT on the adipokines involved in the insulin regulation could be useful for the treatment of insulin resistance or diabetes. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the effects of nonperiodized vs. periodized RT on plasma adiponectin, leptin and insulin resistance index in overweight men. Thirty two sedentary overweight men (mean &#xb1; SD; age, 23.4 &#xb1; 0.6 years) were allocated to one of the following (n=8) groups: control group (CON), nonperiodized (NP), linear periodized (LP) and daily undulating periodized (DUP) training groups. Subjects in training groups performed RT protocols 3daysperweek for 8 weeks. Blood samples were taken before and 72 h after the training period and were analyzed for plasma adiponectin, leptin, glucose, and insulin. Insulin resistance decreased in all training groups but significant differences were only found between DUP and CON groups (P&lt;0.05). However, after 8 weeks of RT no significant changes were observed in plasma adiponectin and leptin concentrations. Body fat percent and waist to hip ratio (WHR) decreased significantly (P&lt;0.05) following training, whereas, no significant changes were detected in body mass and BMI (P&gt;0.05). The maximum strength (1RM) for bench press and leg press increased after RT in all training groups (P&lt;0.05). Short-term periodized RT protocols can be an efficient training strategy for improving insulin resistance and muscular strength in overweight men, while, they have no significant influence on adiponectin and leptin.",

    "abstract": "To study the effects of both balneotherapy and mud-bath therapy treatments in patients affected by primary fibromyalgia (FM) using rheumatological, psychiatric, biochemical and proteomic approaches. Forty-one FM patients (39 females, 2 males), who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology criteria received a 2-week thermal therapy programme consisting of therapy once daily for 6 days/week. Twenty-one patients received mud-bath treatment, while the other twenty balneotherapy. Pain, symptoms, and quality of life were assessed. Oxytocin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), ATP and serotonin transporter levels during therapy were assayed. Comparative whole saliva (WS) proteomic analysis was performed using a combination of two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) and mass spectrometry techniques. We observed a reduction in pain, FIQ values and improvement of SF36 in both groups of patients treated with mud-bath or balneotherapy. The improvement of the outcome measures occurred with different timing and duration in the two spa treatments. A significant decrease in BDNF concentrations was observed either after balneotherapy or mud-bath therapy when assayed after twelve weeks, while no significant change in oxytocin levels, ATP levels and serotonin transporter were detected. Significant differences were observed for phosphoglycerate mutase1 (PGAM1) and zinc alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 (AZGP1) protein expression. Our results showed that the thermal treatment might have a beneficial effect on the specific symptoms of the disease. In particular, while balneotherapy gives results that in most patients occur after the end of the treatment but which are no longer noticeable after 3 months, the mud-bath treatment gives longer lasting results.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin and urinary adiponectin excretions have been ascribed a function in glomerular physiology and seem to indicate vascular disease in diabetes. The aim of this study was to compare the urinary excretion of albumin and adiponectin as predictors for decline of renal function in patients with type 2 diabetes and early kidney disease. Over 141 patients were screened for renal function (estimated GFR, ml/min*1.73&#xa0;m(2)), albumin excretion rate (AER, mg/24&#xa0;h), total as well as high molecular weight (HMW) urinary adiponectin excretion (ng/mol u-creatinine). AER and adiponectin excretion were studied as predictors of renal function after 1&#xa0;year. After 1&#xa0;year, 36 patients were in the upper quartile of eGFR decline and defined as progressors (delta eGFR&#xa0;=&#xa0;-&#xa0;12.3&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;6.3) while the remaining 105 patients were defined as non-progressors (delta eGFR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.4&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;6.0). At baseline, HMW-adiponectin excretion was positively correlated with HbA1c (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) and negatively with eGFR (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001), but not with AER (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.14). Progressors showed increased urinary HMW-adiponectin at baseline (158[IQR41/479] vs. 65[24/168] ng/mol; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.01), while total adiponectin (182[101/1534] vs. 345[118/1361] ng/mol) and AER (48[23/109] vs. 46[25/108] mg/24&#xa0;h) excretion showed no differences between the groups. Multivariate logistic regression showed that HMW-adiponectin excretion was an independent predictor of renal progression in all patients (OR 1.86 [95&#xa0;% CI 1.34-2.59]; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.01), especially in those (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;45) with normal AER at baseline (OR 2.16 [95&#xa0;% CI 1.1-4.56]; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05). Urinary HMW-adiponectin but not AER improved the prediction of progressors in ROC analysis (AUC 0.72 [95&#xa0;% CI 0.63-0.81] vs. 0.80 [95&#xa0;% CI 0.71-0.90], p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05). In conclusion, urinary HMW-adiponectin excretion may identify diabetes patients at increased risk for progression of kidney disease.",

    "abstract": "Walnut consumption is associated with reduced risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). We assessed the effect of walnuts on lipid and glucose metabolism, adipokines, inflammation and endothelial function in healthy Caucasian men and postmenopausal women &#x2265;50years old. Forty subjects (mean&#xb1;SEM: age 60&#xb1;1years, BMI 24.9&#xb1;0.6kg/m(2); 30 females) were included in a controlled, cross-over study and randomized to receive first a walnut-enriched (43g/d) and then a Western-type (control) diet or vice-versa, with each lasting 8weeks and separated by a 2-week wash-out. At the beginning and end of each diet phase, measurements of fasting values, a mixed meal test and an assessment of postprandial endothelial function (determination of microcirculation by peripheral artery tonometry) were conducted. Area under the curve (AUC), incremental AUC (iAUC) and treatment&#xd7;time interaction (shape of the curve) were evaluated for postprandial triglycerides, VLDL-triglycerides, chylomicron-triglycerides, glucose and insulin. Compared with the control diet, the walnut diet significantly reduced non-HDL-cholesterol (walnut vs. control: -10&#xb1;3 vs. -3&#xb1;2mg/dL; p=0.025) and apolipoprotein-B (-5.0&#xb1;1.3 vs. -0.2&#xb1;1.1mg/dL; p=0.009) after adjusting for age, gender, BMI and diet sequence. Total cholesterol showed a trend toward reduction (p=0.073). Fasting VLDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, and HbA1c did not change significantly. Similarly, fasting adipokines, C-reactive protein, biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction, postprandial lipid and glucose metabolism and endothelial function were unaffected. Daily consumption of 43g of walnuts for 8weeks significantly reduced non-HDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein-B, which may explain in part the epidemiological observation that regular walnut consumption decreases CHD risk.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin (ADIPOQ) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN) and previous studies regarding the association between ADIPOQ polymorphisms and DN risk reported conflicting results. To derive a more precise estimation of this association, we performed a meta-analysis to assess the association between four ADIPOQ polymorphisms [-11391G&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A (rs17300539), -11377C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;G (rs266729), +45T&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;G (rs2241766), and +276G&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;T (rs1501299)] and risk for DN. Odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were pooled to assess the association between four aforementioned polymorphisms and susceptibility to DN. Based on the included criteria, we selected 13 articles, among which 7 studies (cases/controls: 2749/7585) for -11391G&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A, 8 studies for -11377C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;G (3074/3842), 9 studies for +45T&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;G (2654/7710), and 10 studies for +276G&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;T (2812/7821), respectively. Our meta-analysis indicated no evidence heterogeneity among the included studies; thus, the fixed-effects model was used. Overall, there was an association between ADIPOQ -11391A allele with increased DN risk (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.186, 95% CI: 1.051-1.338, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.006).

    "abstract": "Antipsychotic medications are used to effectively treat various symptoms for different psychiatric conditions. Unfortunately, antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG) is a common side effect that frequently results in obesity and secondary medical conditions. Twin and sibling studies have indicated that genetic factors are likely to be highly involved in AIWG. Over recent years, there has been considerable progress in this area, with several consistently replicated findings, as well as the identification of new genes and implicated pathways. Here, we will review the most recent genetic studies related to AIWG using the Medline database (PubMed) and Google Scholar. Among the steadiest findings associated with AIWG are serotonin 2C receptors (HTR2C) and leptin promoter gene variants, with more recent studies implicating MTHFR and, in particular, MC4R genes. Additional support was reported for the HRH1, BDNF, NPY, CNR1, GHRL, FTO and AMPK genes. Notably, some of the reported variants appear to have relatively large effect sizes. These findings have provided insights into the mechanisms involved in AIWG and will help to develop predictive genetic tests in the near future.",

    "abstract": "A deficit in adiponectin plays an important causal role in insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. We hypothesized that as seen during the fasting state, the intake of a walnut-enriched meal increased postprandial adiponectin. Twenty-one healthy white men followed a 4-week baseline diet and then consumed 3 fat-loaded meals that included 1 g fat/kg body weight (65% fat) according to a randomized crossover design: olive oil-enriched meal (22% saturated fatty acids [SFA], 38% monounsaturated fatty acids [MUFA], 4% polyunsaturated fatty acids [PUFA]), butter-enriched meal (35% SFA, 22% MUFA, 4% PUFA), and walnut-enriched meal (20% SFA, 24% MUFA, 16% PUFA, and 4% &#x3b1;-linolenic acid). Leptin, resistin, adiponectin, and free fatty acids were determined at 0, 3, 6, and 8.5 hours after the fat load. After the walnut-enriched meal, plasma adiponectin concentrations were higher at 3 and 6 hours (P = .011, P = .046, respectively) compared with the butter-enriched meal and higher at 6 hours compared with the olive oil-enriched meal (P = .036). Free fatty acid levels decreased from baseline at 3 hours after the walnut-enriched meal (P = .001). No differences were observed between the 3 meals for leptin and resistin responses. Our data confirmed a beneficial profile in the postprandial response to walnuts, source of omega-3 PUFA with an increased postprandial adiponectin and lower postprandial free fatty acid responses. These findings suggest that the postprandial state is important for understanding the possible cardioprotective effects associated with omega-3 PUFA dietary fat.",

Whether these effects occur in normal weight and overweight individuals remains unknown. This study examined the effect of ADF on body weight and coronary heart disease risk in non-obese subjects. Thirty-two subjects (BMI 20-29.9&#xa0;kg/m2) were randomized to either an ADF group or a control group for 12&#xa0;weeks. Body weight decreased (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) by 5.2 &#xb1; 0.9&#xa0;kg (6.5 &#xb1; 1.0%) in the ADF group, relative to the control group, by week 12.

LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, homocysteine and resistin concentrations remained unchanged after 12&#xa0;weeks of treatment.

A case-cohort study nested within the Potsdam cohort of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer was performed, with 170 incident cases of ischemic stroke and a randomly selected subcohort of 2155 participants without major cardiovascular disease at baseline. A random-effects dose-response meta-analysis was performed on prospective studies reporting on adiponectin and incident stroke in healthy populations up to April 2013, identified through MEDLINE and EMBASE. In European Prospective Investigation into Cancer-Potsdam, after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, the hazard ratio of ischemic stroke per 5-&#xb5;g/mL higher total-adiponectin was 1.10 (95% confidence interval, 0.89-1.37). Participants with higher total-adiponectin had higher high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and lower high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and triglyceride levels, and had less often diabetes mellitus. Additional adjustment for these putative mediators yielded a hazard ratio of 1.31 (95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.64). Nine studies (19,259 participants, 2960 cases), including European Prospective Investigation into Cancer-Potsdam, were meta-analyzed. Pooling relative risks adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors not including putative mediators indicated moderate between-study heterogeneity (I2=52.2%). This was explained by the smallest study, and the pooled relative risk (95% confidence interval) before and after its exclusion was 1.03 (0.98-1.08) and 0.99 (0.96-1.01) per 5 &#xb5;g/mL, respectively.

Thus, the objective of this trial is to examine the effect of chungkookjang compared to placebo on variables of metabolic syndrome in overweight/obese subjects. This double-blind randomized controlled crossover trial will be conducted on 120 overweight/obese subjects; aged 19-29 years.

Enrolled subjects will be randomly assigned to two groups of equal number; one group received 35 g of chungkookjang (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;60) and the other group received placebo (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;60) on a regular daily basis for 12 weeks. After a 12-week washout period, the groups will be crossed over. In addition to anthropometric measures and blood pressure, glucose parameter, lipid profile, adipocytokine, and carnitine assay will be determined at baseline and 12 week. Also, safety will be assessing by measuring total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, total protein, albumin, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and creatine kinase at baseline and 12 weeks. 24-hour dietary recalls were collected at the baseline and at the end of the trial.

Leptin is an important regulator of food intake and energy expenditure. To conduct a meta-analysis to determine whether the level of leptin is related to the disease status of COPD. Studies published before December 2012 were identified by searching PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Database. Observational studies comparing circulating leptin levels between COPD patients and healthy controls were included. Data were independently extracted by two investigators and analyzed using Stata 12.0 software. Ten articles were included in the meta-analysis. Circulating leptin levels were correlated with the body mass index (BMI) as well as percent fat mass in stable COPD patients. The correlation coefficient tended to be weaker during exacerbation. A positive correlation between leptin and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x3b1; levels was found in COPD exacerbations, while it disappeared in patients with stable disease. Most studies indicated that circulating leptin levels in stable COPD patients were not significantly different from those in healthy controls when adjusted for gender and BMI, whilst leptin levels tended to elevate in exacerbation groups. The normal regulatory mechanism of leptin is maintained in stable COPD patients despite weight loss. The additional correlation between leptin and TNF-&#x3b1; during exacerbations may support the closer association of leptin with changes in nutritional parameters and suggests its valuable role in the evaluation of systemic inflammatory responses in COPD patients during exacerbation, which merits further study.",

    "abstract": "Cross-sectional and longitudinal reports show that obese adults have more asthma than non-obese adults. A proposed mechanism is via effects of adipokines (leptin and adiponectin) on the immune system. We wished to measure the associations of asthma and other atopic diseases with serum adipokine levels and to find whether the associations with asthma were strong enough to rule out the possibility that they are secondary to the association of fatness measures with asthma. The Global Asthma and Allergy Network of Excellence (GA(2) LEN) clinical follow-up survey is a clinical survey, embedded in a larger multi-centre cross-sectional postal survey, involving, with a case/control design, enrichment of the sample with subjects with asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). We recorded serum leptin or adiponectin in 845 men and 1110 women in 15 centres and also anthropometric measures of fatness including body mass index and waist/hip ratio, current asthma, and specific skin prick and IgE sensitisation. We used inverse sampling-probability-weighted rank and regression statistics to measure population associations of disease outcomes with adipokines in males and females, adjusting for confounders (area, age, smoking history, and number of elder siblings) and also mutually adjusting associations with adipokines and fatness measures. One thousand nine hundred and fifty-five subjects aged 16-77&#xa0;years had information on leptin or adiponectin levels. Leptin and leptin/adiponectin ratio were positively associated with the level of asthma, especially in females (Somers' D of leptin by asthma score, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.08-0.30; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.00079). These associations were attenuated after adjusting for confounders and became non-significant after additionally adjusting for fatness measures and multiple comparisons. Asthma levels are positively associated with serum leptin. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that this association is secondary to associations of both with fatness measures.",

The final analysis included 16 published studies of 6569 cases and 8405 controls for the LEP G2548A and 19 studies of 7504 cases and 9581 controls for the LEPR Q223R. Overall, LEP G2548A was statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of overall cancer (AA vs. GG: OR=1.27, 95% CI=1.05-1.54; recessive model: OR=1.19, 95% CI=1.00-1.41). Further stratifications by cancer type showed an increased risk for prostate cancer (recessive model: OR=1.26, 95% CI=1.05-1.51) but not for other cancers. For LEPR Q223R, no statistical evidence for an association with risk of cancer was found for all; however, further stratification by ethnicity showed an increased risk for Africans but not for other ethnicities. No significantly differences in LEP and LEPR mRNA expression were found among genotypes or by ethnicity. Despite some limitations, this meta-analysis found some statistical evidence for an association between the LEP 2548AA genotype and overall risk of cancer, particularly for prostate cancer, but given this variant did not have an effect on mRNA expression, this association warrants additional validation in large and well-designed studies.",

    "abstract": "Low adiponectin levels are discussed as risk factor for cardiovascular events. This is of special importance in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) because they are at higher risk for cardiovascular diseases. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of two plant oils rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), with different content of omega-3 fatty acids, on adiponectin levels, glucose and lipid metabolism in T2DM individuals treated either with insulin or oral anti-diabetics (OAD). Ninety-two subjects with T2DM [34 treated with insulin (T2DM-Ins) and 58 treated with OAD (T2DM-OAD)] participated in this randomised, double-blind, parallel intervention study. Individuals received either 9 g of nut oil (n-3:n-6 ratio: 1.3 : 6.1) or mixed oil (n-3:n-6 ratio: 0.6 : 5.7) per day for 10 weeks. The fatty acid profile, tocopherol, adiponectin levels and parameters regarding glucose and lipid metabolism were assessed at baseline, during and after the intervention. Compliance was confirmed by significant increases in &#x3b3;-tocopherol and PUFA in both oil groups. An increase in adiponectin levels in T2DM-Ins participants (+6.84% in nut oil and +4.47% in mixed oil group after 10 weeks compared to baseline) was observed, albeit not significantly different from T2DM-OAD individuals (P = 0.051). Lipid and glucose metabolism were not affected by the intervention. The present study provides evidence that a small and easy change in dietary behaviour towards better fat quality moderately increases adiponectin levels in T2DM-Ins subjects, independently of the administered plant oil.",

    "abstract": "Blood levels of adiponectin, an adipocyte-secreted protein correlated with metabolic and cardiovascular risks, are highly heritable. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies for adiponectin levels have identified 14 loci harboring variants associated with blood levels of adiponectin. To identify novel adiponectin-associated loci, particularly those of importance in East Asians, we conducted a meta-analysis of GWA studies for adiponectin in 7827 individuals, followed by two stages of replications in 4298 and 5954 additional individuals. We identified a novel adiponectin-associated locus on chromosome 10 near WDR11-FGFR2 (P = 3.0 &#xd7; 10(-14)) and provided suggestive evidence for a locus on chromosome 12 near OR8S1-LALBA (P = 1.2 &#xd7; 10(-7)). Of the adiponectin-associated loci previously described, we confirmed the association at CDH13 (P = 6.8 &#xd7; 10(-165)), ADIPOQ (P = 1.8 &#xd7; 10(-22)), PEPD (P = 3.6 &#xd7; 10(-12)), CMIP (P = 2.1 &#xd7; 10(-10)), ZNF664 (P = 2.3 &#xd7; 10(-7)) and GPR109A (P = 7.4 &#xd7; 10(-6)). Conditional analysis at ADIPOQ revealed a second signal with suggestive evidence of association only after conditioning on the lead SNP (Pinitial = 0.020; Pconditional = 7.0 &#xd7; 10(-7)). We further confirmed the independence of two pairs of closely located loci (&lt;2 Mb) on chromosome 16 at CMIP and CDH13, and on chromosome 12 at GPR109A and ZNF664. In addition, the newly identified signal near WDR11-FGFR2 exhibited evidence of association with triglycerides (P = 3.3 &#xd7; 10(-4)), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C, P = 4.9 &#xd7; 10(-4)) and body mass index (BMI)-adjusted waist-hip ratio (P = 9.8 &#xd7; 10(-3)). These findings improve our knowledge of the genetic basis of adiponectin variation, demonstrate the shared allelic architecture for adiponectin with lipids and central obesity and motivate further studies of underlying mechanisms.",

Published prospective studies that reported the association of leptin levels with risk of type 2 diabetes for a certain gender or those that reported gender-specific associations were considered. Dose-response relationships were assessed by the generalized least squares trend estimation and summary relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were computed with the random-effects model. Stratified and sensitivity analyses were also performed to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity. Overall, 11 prospective studies were identified. The summary RR for an increment in leptin levels of 1-log ng mL(-1) was 1.37 (95% CI, 1.13-1.66) for men and 0.96 (95% CI, 0.90-1.03) for women. The differences between genders were statistically significant (P for interaction = 0.006). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses generally confirmed the robustness of these findings. Furthermore, the increased risk in men appeared non-linear, with a tendency to plateau at high levels (P for non-linearity = 0.03). Little evidence of publication bias was found. Collectively, higher leptin levels were found to be associated with elevated risk of type 2 diabetes in men but not in women.",

    "abstract": "Elevation of adiponectin levels is a potential therapeutic tool against cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Clinical evidence suggests differences between fibrates and statins in improving circulating concentrations of adiponectin. To compare the efficacy of fibrates vs. statins on circulating concentrations of adiponectin by meta-analysis of randomized head-to-head trials. A systematic literature search of Medline was conducted to identify randomized head-to-head comparative trials investigating the efficacy of fibrates vs. statins on circulating levels of adiponectin. Inverse variance-weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for net changes in adiponectin concentrations using a random-effects model. Random-effects meta-regression was performed to assess the effect of putative moderators on adiponectin levels. Six trials with a total of 326 subjects (166 in the fibrate and 160 in the statin group) met the eligibility criteria and were selected for this meta-analysis. The estimated effect size for fibrate versus statin therapy was 0.42 &#x3bc;g/mL (95% CI: -0.34-1.17). This effect size was robust in the leave-one-out sensitivity analysis and not sensitive to any single study. Meta-regression indicated a borderline significant association between duration of treatment and the effect of fibrates vs. statins on adiponectin concentrations (slope: -0.20; 95% CI: -0.41-0.01; p=0.06). However, baseline body mass index, glucose and lipid levels did not predict the effect of fibrate vs. statin therapy on circulating adiponectin concentrations (p&gt;0.05). Monotherapy with either fibrates or statins has comparable effects on circulating concentrations of adiponectin. Thus, differential effects of statins and fibrates on the occurrence of cardiovascular events may not be attributed to the corresponding changes in adiponectin levels.",

Healthy South Asian women with baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of &lt;75&#xa0;nmol/L were randomised to receive a single dose of 100,000 units oral vitamin D3 or matching placebo. Outcomes were measured at baseline, 4 and 8 weeks. The primary outcome was change in endothelial function measured using brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation. Secondary outcomes included blood pressure, arterial stiffness, microvascular function measured using laser Doppler iontophoresis, insulin resistance, serum lipids, circulating markers of inflammation, thrombosis and adipokines. 50 women were randomised, 25 to each group. Mean age was 41 years; mean baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was 27&#xa0;nmol/L. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D levels rose in the vitamin D group relative to the placebo group by 4 weeks (16&#xa0;nmol/L, 95% CI 11 to 21, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001).

In this review, we aimed to systematically assess and summarize evidence regarding the association of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) with inflammatory markers and adipokines. An electronic search of the literature was conducted up to September 2010 using Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and Science Direct (updated from September 2010 to August 2011 through Medline). Original studies that were written in Portuguese, English, Spanish, or French, and addressed the effects of SFA (not dietary sources or SFA-rich diets) on inflammatory markers or adipokines in adult populations were considered eligible. Data from 15 studies providing adjusted estimates were extracted. The publication year varied from 1995 to 2010 and the sample size from 54 to 4900. Most studies were cross sectional, with 3 studies using a prospective design. Twelve studies assessed total SFA, and 3 studies considered their subtypes, which were measured through dietary assessments (11 studies) or in blood samples (4 studies). Significant positive associations were observed between SFA and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and interleukin-6, whereas no significant associations were observed with E-selectin, tumor necrosis factor &#x3b1;, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, fibrinogen, and adiponectin. For high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, 2 studies showed significant positive associations, whereas 3 studies reported no significant associations. One study reported a significant inverse association of SFA with leptin, although the other 3 found no significant associations. Based on this systematic review, a potential positive association of SFA with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein but not with adipokines is suggested, which should be confirmed by future research.",

    "abstract": "The myokine irisin has been proposed to regulate energy homeostasis. Little is known about its association with metabolic parameters and especially with parameters influencing pathways of lipid metabolism. In the context of a clinical trial, an exploratory post hoc analysis has been performed in healthy subjects to determine whether simvastatin and/or ezetimibe influence serum irisin levels. The direct effects of simvastatin on irisin were also examined in primary human skeletal muscle cells (HSKMCs). A randomized, parallel 3-group study was performed in 72 men with mild hypercholesterolemia and without apparent cardiovascular disease. Each group of 24 subjects received a 14-day treatment with either simvastatin 40 mg, ezetimibe 10 mg, or their combination. Baseline irisin concentrations were not significantly correlated with age, BMI, estimated GFR, thyroid parameters, glucose, insulin, lipoproteins, non-cholesterol sterols, adipokines, inflammation markers and various molecular markers of cholesterol metabolism. Circulating irisin increased significantly in simvastatin-treated but not in ezetimibe-treated subjects. The changes were independent of changes in LDL-cholesterol and were not correlated with changes in creatine kinase levels. In HSKMCs, simvastatin significantly increased irisin secretion as well as mRNA expression of its parent peptide hormone FNDC5. Simvastatin significantly induced cellular reactive oxygen species levels along with expression of pro- and anti-oxidative genes such as Nox2, and MnSOD and catalase, respectively. Markers of cellular stress such as atrogin-1 mRNA and Bax protein expression were also induced by simvastatin. Decreased cell viability and increased irisin secretion by simvastatin was reversed by antioxidant mito-TEMPO, implying in part that irisin is secreted as a result of increased mitochondrial oxidative stress and subsequent myocyte damage. Simvastatin increases irisin concentrations in vivo and in vitro. It remains to be determined whether this increase is a result of muscle damage or a protective mechanism against simvastatin-induced cellular stress. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00317993 NCT00317993.",

    "abstract": "Mineral bone disorder (MBD) is an early complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD), with complex interactions in the bone-kidney-energy axis. These events lead to impaired bone remodelling, which in turn is associated with cardiovascular disease. Recently, we reported on a positive effect of phosphate binder treatment on bone remodelling markers and a reduction in serum FGF-23 levels in predialysis-CKD patients. The goal of the present study of this trial was to examine the effects of phosphate binders on energy-regulating hormones and Wnt pathway. In this present post hoc analysis of the above randomized, open-label, 8-week trial, which compared the effects of increasing doses of sevelamer-HCl or calcium acetate on various CKD-MBD parameters in 40 normophosphatemic CKD Stage 3-4 patients, we measured serum sclerostin, Dickkopf-1, leptin, adiponectin and serotonin concentrations. Serum sclerostin, Dickkopf-1 and leptin were elevated at baseline despite normal calcium, phosphorus levels and daily urinary phosphorus excretion. There were significant and positive correlations between sclerostin and FGF-23, as well between leptin and Dickkopf-1. Treatment with both phosphate binders led to a significant decrease in phosphate overload. However, sevelamer-HCl, but not with calcium acetate, led to a significant decrease in serum FGF-23, sclerostin and leptin, and to a significant increase in bone alkaline phosphatase levels. Early stages of CKD are associated with an impairment of the Wnt pathway, as reflected by elevated sclerostin, and a dysregulation of energy-regulating hormones. Many of these disturbances can be ameliorated by phosphate binder treatment, more with sevelamer-HCl than with calcium acetate.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have investigated the association between adiponectin +45 nucleotide T/G (+45T&gt;G) polymorphisms and cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, these studies have been inconclusive because of obvious inconsistencies among results. The present study aims to quantify the strength of the association between +45T&gt;G (rs2241766) in the adiponectin gene and the risk of CVD. We searched the PubMed, Embase, and Wangfang databases for studies related to the association between the adiponectin +45T&gt;G genotype and the risk of CVD. We estimated the summary odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) to assess the association. A total of 28 case-control studies, with 12,378 CVD cases and 19,368 controls, were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis of the 28 studies showed that the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) +45T&gt;G genotype was associated with an increased risk of CVD (random-effects OR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.08-1.39, p = 0.002). After adjusting for heterogeneity, the meta-analysis showed that the SNP +45T&gt;G genotype was associated with the risk of CVD in the analyses of the total population and the Caucasian population (for the total population, fixed-effects OR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.01-1.23, p = 0.012; for the Caucasian population, fixed-effects OR = 1.16, 95% CI 1.01-1.34, p = 0.039). No significant association was found in other populations. Evidence of publication bias was observed in the meta-analysis. A significant association between rs2241766 in the adiponectin gene and CVD was established by the meta-analysis.",

    "abstract": "Estimates of the heritability of plasma fibrinogen concentration, an established predictor of cardiovascular disease, range from 34% to 50%. Genetic variants so far identified by genome-wide association studies explain only a small proportion (&lt;2%) of its variation. We conducted a meta-analysis of 28 genome-wide association studies including &gt;90 000 subjects of European ancestry, the first genome-wide association meta-analysis of fibrinogen levels in 7 studies in blacks totaling 8289 samples, and a genome-wide association study in Hispanics totaling 1366 samples. Evaluation for association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms with clinical outcomes included a total of 40 695 cases and 85 582 controls for coronary artery disease, 4752 cases and 24 030 controls for stroke, and 3208 cases and 46 167 controls for venous thromboembolism. Overall, we identified 24 genome-wide significant (P&lt;5&#xd7;10(-8)) independent signals in 23 loci, including 15 novel associations, together accounting for 3.7% of plasma fibrinogen variation. Gene-set enrichment analysis highlighted key roles in fibrinogen regulation for the 3 structural fibrinogen genes and pathways related to inflammation, adipocytokines, and thyrotrophin-releasing hormone signaling. Whereas lead single-nucleotide polymorphisms in a few loci were significantly associated with coronary artery disease, the combined effect of all 24 fibrinogen-associated lead single-nucleotide polymorphisms was not significant for coronary artery disease, stroke, or venous thromboembolism. We identify 23 robustly associated fibrinogen loci, 15 of which are new. Clinical outcome analysis of these loci does not support a causal relationship between circulating levels of fibrinogen and coronary artery disease, stroke, or venous thromboembolism.",

    "abstract": "Several lines of evidence have indicated the insulin-sensitizing, anti-diabetic and anti-atherosclerotic properties of adiponectin, as well as the inverse association between circulating levels of this adipokine and development of cardiovascular outcomes. Improvement of adiponectin status has been reported as a pleiotropic effect of fibrate therapy, but the findings have not been conclusive. To systematically review and meta-analyze available evidence from randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) on the impact of fibrate therapy on circulating levels of adiponectin. A comprehensive literature search in Medline was carried out to identify RCTs comparing the effect of fibrate therapy vs. placebo on circulating concentrations of adiponectin. A meta-analysis of eligible studies was performed using a random-effects model. Quality assessment, sensitivity analysis and publication bias evaluations were conducted using standard methods. Twelve RCTs comprising 443 cases and 437 controls met the selection criteria for systematic review, out of which 9 RCTs (399 cases and 401 controls) were included in the meta-analysis. Quantitative data synthesis revealed a significant effect for fibrate therapy in increasing circulating adiponectin levels (weighed mean difference: 0.38 &#x3bc;g/mL; 95% confidence interval: 0.13-0.63 &#x3bc;g/mL; p = 0.003). The effect size remained statistically significant when restricting the analysis to fenofibrate trials [0.31 (0.21-0.42) &#x3bc;g/mL; p &lt; 0.00001). The observed effect was robust in sensitivity analyses and independent of fibrate dose. Imputation for potential missing studies led to the estimation of a greater effect size for fibrate therapy [0.53 (0.24-0.82) &#x3bc;g/mL]. The present meta-analysis suggests that fibrate therapy increases circulating levels of adiponectin. Whether increase in adiponectin levels contributes to reduction of cardiovascular effects in subjects with dyslipidemia treated with fibrates merits further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Studies in persons of European descent have suggested that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups influence antiretroviral therapy (ART) toxicity. We explored associations between mtDNA variants and changes in endothelial function and biomarkers among non-Hispanic white, ART-naive subjects starting ART. A5152s was a substudy of A5142, a randomized trial of initial class-sparing ART regimens that included efavirenz or lopinavir/ritonavir with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), or both without NRTIs. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and cardiovascular biomarker assessments were performed at baseline and at weeks 4 and 24. Ten haplogroup-defining mtDNA polymorphisms were determined. FMD and biomarker changes from baseline to week 24 by mtDNA variant were assessed using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Thirty-nine non-Hispanic white participants had DNA and 24-week data. The nonsynonymous m.10398A&gt;G mtDNA polymorphism (N=8) was associated with higher median baseline adiponectin (5.0 vs. 4.2 &#x3bc;g/ml; p=0.003), greater absolute (-1.9 vs. -0.2 &#x3bc;g/ml) and relative (-33% vs. -3%) adiponectin decreases (p&lt;0.001 for both), and lower week 24 brachial artery FMD (3.6% vs. 5.4%; p=0.04). Individual mtDNA haplogroups, including haplogroups H (N=13) and U (N=6), were not associated with adiponectin or FMD changes. In this small pilot study, adiponectin and brachial artery FMD on ART differed in non-Hispanic whites with a nonsynonymous mtDNA variant associated with several human diseases. These preliminary findings support the hypothesis that mtDNA variation influences metabolic ART effects. Validation studies in larger populations and in different racial/ethnic groups that include m.10398G carriers are needed.",

    "abstract": "YKL-40 is a chitinase-like protein that, in cross-sectional clinical studies, has been associated with severe asthma and COPD in smokers. To determine the longitudinal relation of circulating YKL-40 to levels and decline of lung function in the general population. We used longitudinal data from up to 13 surveys from the population-based TESAOD study which was conducted in Tucson, Arizona between 1972 and 1996. In cross-sectional analyses, we also used data from 3 Spanish centers of the multicenter ECRHS study (ECRHS-Sp). Serum YKL-40 was measured at baseline in TESAOD and in survey 2 in ECRHS-Sp using ELISAs. Multivariate linear regression was used to test associations of serum YKL-40 to concomitant lung function. In TESAOD, random coefficients models were used to test associations of serum YKL-40 to subsequent decline of lung function. Data on YKL-40 and lung function were available from 1088 TESAOD and 854 ECRHS-Sp adult participants (59% and 51% females; respectively). In adjusted multivariate meta-analyses, being in the highest YKL-40 quartile was associated cross-sectionally with significant deficits in FEV1 and FVC %predicted. In adjusted longitudinal analyses, TESAOD participants in the top YKL-40 quartile had an FEV1 decline that was 5 ml/yr (p = 0.05) faster than subjects in the third quartile, 5 ml/yr (p = 0.02) faster than subjects in the second quartile, and 10 ml/yr (p &lt; 0.001) faster than subjects in the lowest YKL-40 quartile. These longitudinal effects were particularly strong in smokers and absent in never smokers. After adjusting for covariates, as compared with the other three quartiles combined, the top YKL-40 quartile was associated with a 9 ml/yr (p = 0.001) faster FEV1 decline among smokers, while no significant effects were found among never smokers (2 ml/yr, p = 0.35). Circulating YKL-40 is associated with levels and decline of lung function in the general population and may be a biomarker of susceptibility to the long-term effects of cigarette smoking.",

    "abstract": "Fenofibrate is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#x3b1; that has been clinically used to treat dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying fenofibrate action, we investigated whether fenofibrate affects serum levels of vaspin, an adipocytokine that has recently been shown to link obesity and insulin resistance. Fenofibrate treatment significantly increased serum vaspin levels of dyslipidemic patients, which correlated with reduced body weight and increased insulin sensitivity. To elucidate the biochemical mechanisms of fenofibrate action, we investigated the effect of fenofibrate on vaspin mRNA and protein expressions in obese rats. Fenofibrate greatly increased vaspin mRNA and protein levels in visceral adipose tissue consisting of retroperitoneal, mesenteric, and periepididymal adipose tissue but not in the subcutaneous adipose tissue, which correlated with increased serum vaspin levels and increased insulin sensitivity in obese rats. Consistent with a direct effect on vaspin expression, fenofibrate treatment significantly increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of vaspin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Together, our results demonstrate for the first time that fenofibrate upregulates vaspin expression in dyslipidemic human subjects and suggest that upregulation of vaspin expression in adipocytes may provide a mechanism by which fenofibrate improves insulin sensitivity in dyslipidemic patients.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether suction-assisted lipectomy (SAL) decreases the incidence of early cardiovascular disease risk factors or its biochemical and clinical risk indicators. A systematic review of the literature was performed by conducting a predefined, sensitive search in MEDLINE without limiting the year of publication or language. The extracted data included the basal characteristics of the patients, the surgical technique, the amount of fat extracted, the cardiovascular risk factors and the biochemical and clinical markers monitored over time. The data were analysed using pooled curves, risk ratios and standardised means with meta-analytical techniques. Fifteen studies were identified involving 357 patients. In all of the studies, measurements of predefined variables were recorded before and after the SAL procedure. The median follow-up was 3 months (interquartile range (IQR) 1-6, range 0.5-10.5). The mean amount of extracted fat ranged from 2063 to 16,300 ml, with a mean &#xb1; standard deviation (SD) of 6138 &#xb1; 4735 ml. After adjusting for time and body mass index (BMI), leptin and fasting insulin were the only markers that were significantly associated with the amount of aspirated fat. No associations were observed for high sensitive C-reactive protein (hCRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), adiponectin, resistin, tumour necrosis factor-&#x3b1; (TNF-&#x3b1;), Homeostasis Model of Assessment (HOMA), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides, free fatty acids or systolic blood pressure. Based on the results of our analysis, we conclude that there is no evidence to support the hypothesis that subcutaneous fat removal reduces early cardiovascular or metabolic disease, its markers or its risk factors.",

In this study, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the association between adiponectin polymorphisms and CRC risk. All eligible case-control studies published up to March 2013 were identified by searching PubMed, Web of Science and CNKI. Effect sizes of odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated by using a fixed- or random-effect model. A total of 9 case-control studies were included, Of those studies, there were eight studies (2024 cases and 2777 controls) for rs1501299G/T polymorphism, five studies (1401 cases and 1691 controls) for rs2241766T/G polymorphism, five studies (2945 cases and 3361 controls) for rs266729C/G polymorphism, three studies (1221 cases and 1579 controls) for rs822395A/C polymorphism and three studies (1222 cases and 1575 controls) for rs822396A/G polymorphism. Overall, a significant association was observed for rs2241766T/G polymorphism under heterozygote comparison (TG vs. TT: OR=1.22, 95%CI: 1.05-1.43); while there was no significant association for rs2241766 polymorphism under other genetic models, and for other four polymorphisms under all genetic models. Besides, when stratified analyses by ethnicity, no significant association between five polymorphisms and CRC risk were observed under all genetic models among Asian, Caucasian and African-American.

    "abstract": "Adiponectin is strongly inversely associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, but its causal role remains controversial. We used a Mendelian randomization approach to test the hypothesis that adiponectin causally influences insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. We used genetic variants at the ADIPOQ gene as instruments to calculate a regression slope between adiponectin levels and metabolic traits (up to 31,000 individuals) and a combination of instrumental variables and summary statistics-based genetic risk scores to test the associations with gold-standard measures of insulin sensitivity (2,969 individuals) and type 2 diabetes (15,960 case subjects and 64,731 control subjects). In conventional regression analyses, a 1-SD decrease in adiponectin levels was correlated with a 0.31-SD (95% CI 0.26-0.35) increase in fasting insulin, a 0.34-SD (0.30-0.38) decrease in insulin sensitivity, and a type 2 diabetes odds ratio (OR) of 1.75 (1.47-2.13). The instrumental variable analysis revealed no evidence of a causal association between genetically lower circulating adiponectin and higher fasting insulin (0.02 SD; 95% CI -0.07 to 0.11; N = 29,771), nominal evidence of a causal relationship with lower insulin sensitivity (-0.20 SD; 95% CI -0.38 to -0.02; N = 1,860), and no evidence of a relationship with type 2 diabetes (OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.75-1.19; N = 2,777 case subjects and 13,011 control subjects). Using the ADIPOQ summary statistics genetic risk scores, we found no evidence of an association between adiponectin-lowering alleles and insulin sensitivity (effect per weighted adiponectin-lowering allele: -0.03 SD; 95% CI -0.07 to 0.01; N = 2,969) or type 2 diabetes (OR per weighted adiponectin-lowering allele: 0.99; 95% CI 0.95-1.04; 15,960 case subjects vs. 64,731 control subjects).

Sixteen obese and overweight middle-aged men (age, 35-50 years) with type 2 diabetes participated in this study. The subjects were randomly assigned to LAM group (n=8) or control group (n=8). The subjects in LAM group walked two miles in 30 min on a treadmill on 4 days per week for 12 weeks according to the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and American College of Sports Medicine. The results showed that body mass, body mass index, central visceral adipose tissue and subcutaneous adipose tissue volume and hip and thigh subcutaneous adipose tissue (hip and thigh SAT) volume were decreased in the LAM group compared to the control group (P&lt;0.05). Adiponectin mRNA in abdominal and gluteal subcutaneous AT were increased significantly in the LAM group compared to the control group (P&lt;0.05), while plasma adiponectin concentrations, hs-CRP and insulin resistance did not change significantly. In conclusion, adiponectin mRNA levels increase after 12 weeks of LAM; however, plasma adiponectin levels were not affected by this protocol in obese and overweight middle-aged men with type 2 diabetes.",

    "title": "Weight loss, exercise or both and cardiometabolic risk factors in obese older adults: results of a randomized controlled trial.",
    "abstract": "Obesity exacerbates the age-related decline in insulin sensitivity and is associated with risk for cardiometabolic syndrome in older adults; however, the appropriate treatment for obese older adults is controversial. To determine the independent and combined effects of weight loss and exercise on cardiometabolic risk factors in obese older adults. One-hundred and seven obese (body mass index (BMI)&#x2265;30&#x2009;kg&#x2009;m(-2)) older (&#x2265;65 years) adults with physical frailty were randomized to control group, diet group, exercise group and diet-exercise group for 1 year. Outcomes for this study included changes in insulin sensitivity index (ISI), glucose tolerance, central obesity, adipocytokines and cardiometabolic syndrome. Although similar increases in ISI occurred in the diet-exercise and diet groups at 6 months, the ISI improved more in the diet-exercise than in the diet group at 12 months (2.4 vs 1.2; between-group difference, 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.2-2.1); no changes in ISI occurred in both exercise and control groups. The diet-exercise and diet groups had similar improvements in insulin area under the curve (AUC) (-2.9 and -2.9 &#xd7; 10(3)&#x2009;mg&#x2009;min&#x2009;dl(-1)), glucose AUC (-1.4 and -2.2 &#xd7; 10(3)mg&#x2009;min&#x2009;dl(-1)), visceral fat (-787 and -561&#x2009;cm(3)), tumor necrosis factor (-17.0 and -12.8&#x2009;pg&#x2009;ml(-1)), adiponectin (5.0 and 4.0&#x2009;ng&#x2009;ml(-1)), waist circumference (-8.2 and -8.4&#x2009;cm), triglyceride (-30.7 and -24.3&#x2009;g&#x2009;dl(-1)) and systolic/diastolic blood pressure (-15.9 and -13.1/-4.9 and -6.7&#x2009;mm&#x2009;Hg), while no changes in these parameters occurred in both exercise and control groups. The cardiometabolic syndrome prevalence decreased by 40% in the diet-exercise and by 15% in the diet group. Body weight decreased similarly in the diet-exercise and diet groups (-8.6 and -9.7&#x2009;kg) but not in the exercise and control groups. In frail, obese older adults, lifestyle interventions associated with weight loss improve insulin sensitivity and other cardiometabolic risk factors, but continued improvement in insulin sensitivity is only achieved when exercise training is added to weight loss.",

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a fixed olmesartan/amlodipine (Olme/Amlo) combination in improving blood pressure control, lipid profile, insulin sensitivity and some inflammatory and insulin resistance markers. Two hundred and seventy-six hypertensive patients were randomly assigned to olmesartan 20 mg, amlodipine 10 mg or a single pill containing an Olme/Amlo combination 20/5 mg for 12 months. We evaluated after 6 and 12 months: body weight, body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP, respectively), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting plasma insulin (FPI), lipid profile, vaspin, visfatin, interleukins 8 and 10 (IL-8 and IL-10, respectively). Patients also underwent an euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamp. Olme/Amlo combination was more effective in decreasing SBP, and DPB compared to single monotherapies after 12 months. Olme/Amlo combination, but not amlodipine, decreased FPG after 12 months. FPI and HOMA index were decreased, and M value increased by Olme/Amlo combination compared to olmesartan monotherapy, and to amlodipine monotherapy. Olme/Amlo significantly decreased IL-8 and IL-10 better than each monotherapy. Olme/Amlo single pill combination can be a safe and effective option to reduce blood pressure, improve insulin sensitivity and decrease inflammatory markers.",

    "title": "Acute reduction of lipolysis reduces adiponectin and IL-18: evidence from an intervention study with acipimox and insulin.",
    "abstract": "Low-grade inflammation is a feature of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and lipodystrophy. It is associated with abdominal adiposity, increased levels of NEFA, hyperinsulinaemia and low adiponectin levels. However, the causal relationship between impaired metabolism and inflammation is not understood. We explored the anti-lipolytic effect of acipimox and insulin on adiponectin and adipocyte-associated cytokines in patients with lipodystrophy. In a randomised placebo-controlled crossover design using nine patients with non-diabetic, HIV-associated lipodystrophy, we assessed whether (1) overnight administration of a low dose of acipimox and/or (2) insulin-induced suppression of NEFA flux altered circulating plasma levels of adiponectin, IL-18, TNF-&#x3b1; and IL-6 in the basal condition and in a two-stage euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp combined with stable isotopes (insulin infusion rates 20 mU m(-2) min(-1) and 50 mU m(-2) min(-1)). Insulin decreased plasma NEFA in a dose-dependent manner (p &lt; 0.0001). Acipimox reduced basal plasma NEFAs and plasma NEFAs during the low-dose insulin infusion compared with placebo (p &lt; 0.0001 for acipimox effect). Plasma adiponectin and plasma IL-18 were reduced during both situations where lipolysis was inhibited (p &lt; 0.0001 for acipimox effect; p &lt; 0.0001 and p &lt; 0.05 for insulin effect on plasma adiponectin and plasma IL-18, respectively). In contrast, plasma IL-6 and plasma TNF-&#x3b1; did not change during low NEFA concentrations. Using two different tools to manipulate lipolysis, the present study found that acute inhibition of lipolysis reduces levels of adiponectin and IL-18 in patients with HIV-associated lipodystrophy.",

    "title": "Change in adiponectin and oxidative stress after modifiable lifestyle interventions in breast cancer cases.",
    "abstract": "Breast cancer is one of the most frequent diseases in women today. Little information exists on modifiable lifestyle factors including effects of ginger supplements (as an anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory herbal) and water-based exercise on biomarkers related to oxidative stress such as malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and adiponectin in obese women with breast cancer. The aim of this study was to determine the single and concomitant effect of 6-wks water-based exercise and oral ginger supplement on the aforesaid markers in obese women with breast cancer. Forty women diagnosed with breast cancer (48 &#xb1; 5.4 years, 76 &#xb1; 9 kg, fat mass 41.8 &#xb1; 4%), volunteered to participate in the study. Subjects were randomly assigned into four groups; placebo, water-based exercise, ginger supplement and water-based exercise+ginger supplement groups. Subjects in the ginger supplement group and the water-based exercise+ginger supplement group orally received 4 capsules (each capsule contained 750 mg), 7 days a week for 6 weeks. The water-based exercise program featured progressive increase in intensity and time, ranging from 50% to 75% of heart rate reserve, in a pool with 15 meters width, 4 times a week for 6 weeks. Fasting blood samples were collected at pre-test and post-test time points. The ginger supplementation and or the water-base exercise resulted in an increase of adiponectin, NO and GPx and reduction MDA, as compared to pre-test values. However, the combined intervention (water-base exercise and ginger supplement) group showed significantly a far better effect on the biomarkers related to oxidative stress and adiponectin levels, as compared to the water- base exercise or ginger supplement alone groups and the age-matched placebo group. Our results revealed that water-base exercise is a non-drug therapeutic strategy to reduce systemic stress in obese women suffering from breast cancer. Further, ginger supplementation alone or in combination with training, also play an important role in the pathogenesis of oxidative stress in obese women diagnosed with breast cancer.",

    "title": "Cardiometabolic risks during anabolic hormone supplementation in older men.",
    "abstract": "To determine the cardiometabolic risks of testosterone and growth hormone (GH) replacement therapy to youthful levels during aging. A double-masked, partially placebo controlled study in 112 men 65-90 years-old was conducted. Transdermal testosterone (5 g vs. 10 g/day) using a Leydig Cell Clamp and subcutaneous recombinant GH (rhGH) (0 vs. 3 vs. 5 &#x3bc;g/kg/day) were administered for 16-weeks. Measurements included testosterone and IGF-1 levels, body composition by DEXA, and cardiometabolic risk factors (upper body fat, blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, fasting triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, and serum adiponectin) at baseline and after 16 weeks of treatment. Some cardiometabolic factors improved (total and trunk fat, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol) and others worsened (systolic blood pressure, insulin sensitivity index [QUICKI], adiponectin). Cardiometabolic risk composite scores (CRCSs) improved (-0.69 &#xb1; 1.55, P &lt; 0.001). In multivariate analyses, QUICKI, triglycerides, and HDL-cholesterol contributed 33%, 16%, and 14% of the variance in CRCS, respectively. Pathway analyses indicated that changes in fat and lean mass were related to individual cardiometabolic variables and CRCS in a complex manner. Changes in BMI, reflecting composite effects of changes in fat and lean mass, were more robustly associated with cardiometabolic risks than changes in fat mass or LBM individually. Testosterone and rhGH administration was associated with diverse changes in individual cardiometabolic risk factors, but in aggregate appeared not to worsen cardiometabolic risk in healthy older men after 4-months. The long-term effects of these and similar anabolic therapies on cardiovascular events should be investigated in populations with greater functional limitations along with important health disabilities including upper body obesity and other cardiometabolic risks.",

Eighteen-month randomized, controlled trial. The community infrastructure of cooperative extension centers. Overweight and obese (body mass index &gt;28.0 kg/m(2) ) community-dwelling men and women aged 60 to 79 at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Physical activity + weight loss (PA + WL) (n = 98), PA only (n = 97), or successful aging (SA) health education (n = 93) intervention. Biomarkers of inflammation (adiponectin, leptin, high-sensitivity interleukin (hsIL)-6, IL-6sR, IL-8, and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1) were measured at baseline and 6 and 18 months. After adjustment for baseline biomarker, wave, sex, and visit, leptin and hsIL-6 showed a significant intervention effect. Specifically, leptin was significantly lower in the PA + WL group (21.3 ng/mL, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 19.7-22.9 ng/mL) than in the PA (29.3 ng/mL, 95% CI = 26.9-31.8 ng/mL) or SA (30.3 ng/mL, 95% CI = 27.9-32.8 ng/mL) group (both P &lt; .001), and hsIL-6 was significantly lower in the PA + WL group (2.1 pg/mL, 95% CI = 1.9-2.3 pg/mL) than in the PA (2.5 pg/mL, 95% CI = 2.3-2.7 pg/mL) or SA (2.4 pg/mL, 95% CI = 2.2-2.6 pg/mL) group (P = .02). Addition of dietary-induced WL to PA reduced leptin and hsIL-6 more than PA alone and more than a SA intervention in older adults at risk for CVD. Results suggest that WL, rather than increased PA, is the lifestyle factor primarily responsible for improvement in the inflammatory profile.",

Pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence interval (CI) was calculated using fixed or random effects model. A total of five studies (2,596 colorectal cancer cases and 3,240 controls) for association of LEP rs7799039 variant with colorectal cancer, and three studies (1,343 prostate cancer cases and 1,238 controls) for association with prostate cancer were included in the meta-analysis.

    "abstract": "Our aim was to systematically review prospective studies of the association of plasma adiponectin levels with the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events, cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality. We searched Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and CINAHL for reports published through October 2011. Search terms included 'adiponectin' AND 'cardiovascular disease' OR 'mortality'. We included prospective studies lasting more than 1 year with plasma adiponectin levels at baseline and all-cause mortality and/or major cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as outcomes. We used a random-effects model to pool the data and conducted additional subgroup meta-analyses according to the pre-existence of CHD. Pooled relative risk (RR) was estimated by a 1-SD increase in the logarithmically transformed circulating adiponectin levels. A total of 24 prospective studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled RR of adiponectin for CHD events (23 studies) was 1.03 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00, 1.06]. In subgroup analyses, the RR of adiponectin was 0.99 (95% CI: 0.94, 1.03) for new-onset CHD (17 studies), but there was an increased risk (RR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.22) for CHD recurrence (seven studies). A 10% increased risk (RR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.16) of all-cause mortality (six studies) and a 14% increased risk (RR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.23) of cardiovascular disease mortality (five studies) were observed. No association was observed between adiponectin levels and CHD events. Our results suggest that higher circulating adiponectin levels may be associated with an increased risk of CHD recurrence and all-cause/CVD mortality.",

Both are key components in atrial wall remodeling in atrial fibrillation (AF). We studied the relation between rhythm outcome after electrical cardioversion (ECV) for persistent AF and serum levels of YKL-40. A secondary point of interest was a potential effect of the angiotensin receptor blocker candesartan on YKL-40 levels. In the Candesartan in the Prevention of Relapsing Atrial Fibrillation (CAPRAF) study, 171 patients with persistent AF were randomized to receive candesartan 8mg once daily or placebo for 3-6 weeks before ECV and candesartan 16mg once daily or placebo for 6 months after ECV. Serum levels of YKL-40 were measured in fasting blood samples collected at baseline and at end of the study. Mean age was 64&#xb1;11 years, and 39 (22.8%) were women. Sinus rhythm was maintained for 6 months after ECV in 41 (23.9%).

By use of Kaplan-Meier quartile analysis of baseline YKL-40 levels, no relation between YKL-40 levels and risk of AF recurrence was found. End of study YKL-40 levels were unchanged from baseline, both in patients with AF recurrence and those maintaining sinus rhythm for 6 months.

To examine the influence of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of this gene (+276G&gt;T and +45T&gt;G) on circulating adiponectin concentrations, and to evaluate their relationship with adiposity and cardiometabolic risk factors in prepubertal children with and without abdominal obesity. 168 children (78M, 6-10 yr) were examined, divided into three groups based on waist circumference (WC). Auxological and biochemical parameters were measured by standard procedures. Adiponectin SNPs were genotyped using TaqMan allelic discrimination assays. Adiponectin concentration correlated inversely with measures of adiposity (rBMIz-score=-0.211, pBMIz-score=0.007; rwc=-0.210, pwc=0.008; rwc/height=-0.215, pwc/height=0.006), and was significantly influenced by blood glucose, insulin and systolic blood pressure (SBP). The +276T-allele carriers had higher SBP and diastolic BP compared to GG-homozygotes (p&lt;0.05), and expressed higher obesity-related measures and lower adiponectin concentrations. As to the +45T&gt;G SNP, the GGsubject had higher total cholesterol and LDL-C concentrations compared to the T-allele carriers (p&lt;0.05), showing worse obesity measures, higher triglyceride, glucose and insulin and lower serum adiponectin values. Genetic variants of the adiponectin gene had an impact on adiposity, adiponectin concentrations and some cardiometabolic variables among prepubertal children.",

    "title": "Comparison of pitavastatin with atorvastatin in increasing HDL-cholesterol and adiponectin in patients with dyslipidemia and coronary artery disease: the COMPACT-CAD study.",
    "abstract": "Many large-scale clinical trials have confirmed that statins are effective in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level, resulting in reducing cardiovascular events. Recent studies have focused on the effects of statins on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Here we compared the effects of two statins on lipid profile and other metabolic parameters. The study population included 129 patients with stable coronary artery disease, hypercholesterolemia, and hypo-HDL-cholesterolemia (HDL-C&lt;50mg/dl). They were randomly allocated to treatment by pitavastatin 2-4 mg/day or atorvastatin 10-20mg/day and followed-up for 30 months. The primary endpoint was percent changes in HDL-C and adiponectin during the study. The secondary endpoints were percent and absolute changes in markers of glucose metabolism, serum lipids, and apolipoproteins. The effects of 30-month treatment with pitavastatin on HDL-C were significantly greater than those of atorvastatin (%change: pitavastatin: 20.1 &#xb1; 25.7%, atorvastatin: 6.3 &#xb1; 19.8%, p=0.01; absolute change: pitavastatin: 7.3 &#xb1; 9.1mg/dl, atorvastatin: 2.3 &#xb1; 8.0mg/dl, p=0.02). A similar trend was seen with regard to apolipoprotein-AI (ApoAI) (%change: pitavastatin: 20.8 &#xb1; 19.3%, atorvastatin: 11.4 &#xb1; 17.6%, p=0.03; absolute change: pitavastatin: 23.1 &#xb1; 20.2mg/dl, atorvastatin: 12.1 &#xb1; 19.4 mg/dl, p=0.02). Treatment with pitavastatin, but not atorvastatin, significantly increased adiponectin levels. Neither statin had a significant effect on hemoglobin A1c. No severe adverse events were registered during the study. Long-term treatment with pitavastatin resulted in significantly greater increases in serum HDL-C and ApoAI levels without adverse effects on glucose metabolism, compared with atorvastatin.",

    "abstract": "It is unclear why despite a comparable cardiometabolic risk profile, metabolically benign overweight/obese individuals show an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease compared to normal weight individuals. In cross-sectional analyses, we compared levels of ectopic fat (epicardial, pericardial, and hepatic fat) and adipokines (leptin, soluble leptin receptor, and high molecular weight [HMW] adiponectin) among metabolically benign (MBO) and at-risk overweight/obese (ARO), and metabolically benign normal weight (MBNW) women, screened for the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study. We defined metabolically benign with &#x2264; 1, and at-risk with &#x2265;2 components of the metabolic syndrome. Compared to MBO women, ARO women had significantly elevated odds of being in the top tertile of epicardial fat (OR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.04-2.99), hepatic fat (OR: 1.90, 95% CI:1.12-3.24) and leptin (OR: 2.15, 95% CI: 1.23-3.76), and the bottom tertile of HMW-adiponectin (OR: 2.90, 95% CI: 1.62-5.19). Compared to MBNW women, MBO women had significantly higher odds of being in the top tertile of epicardial fat (OR: 5.17, 95% CI: 3.22-8.29), pericardial fat (OR: 9.27, 95% CI: 5.52-15.56) and hepatic fat (OR: 2.72, 95% CI: 1.77-4.19) and the bottom tertile of HMW adiponectin levels (OR: 2.51, 95% CI: 1.60-3.94). Levels of ectopic fat and the adverse adipokine profile increase on a continuum of BMI, suggesting that the metabolically benign phenotype may be a transient state.",

    "abstract": "A large body of epidemiologic data strongly suggests an association between excess adiposity and coronary artery disease (CAD). Low adiponectin levels, a hormone secreted only from adipocytes, have been associated with an increased risk of CAD in observational studies. However, these associations cannot clarify whether this relationship is causal or due to a shared set of causal factors or even confounding. Genome-wide association studies have identified common variants that influence adiponectin levels, providing valuable tools to examine the genetic relationship between adiponectin and CAD. Using 145 genome wide significant SNPs for adiponectin from the ADIPOGen consortium (n = 49,891), we tested whether adiponectin-decreasing alleles influenced risk of CAD in the CARDIoGRAM consortium (n = 85,274). In single-SNP analysis, 5 variants among 145 SNPs were associated with increased risk of CAD after correcting for multiple testing (P &lt; 4.4 &#xd7; 10(-4)). Using a multi-SNP genotypic risk score to test whether adiponectin levels and CAD have a shared genetic etiology, we found that adiponectin-decreasing alleles increased risk of CAD (P = 5.4 &#xd7; 10(-7)). These findings demonstrate that adiponectin levels and CAD have a shared allelic architecture and provide rationale to undertake a Mendelian randomization studies to understand if this relationship is causal.",

    "title": "AdipoQ polymorphisms are associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis study.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin (AdipoQ) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus and is considered as an important candidate gene for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). So far, there have been many studies to investigate the association between the adiponectin polymorphisms and T2DM risk. However, the results are conflicting. To derive a more precise estimation, we performed a meta-analysis to assess the association between five AdipoQ polymorphisms [-11426A &gt; G (rs16861194), -11391G &gt; A (rs17300539), -11377C &gt; G (rs266729), +45T &gt; G (rs2241766) and +276G &gt; T (rs1501299)], and T2DM risk. The fixed and random-effects model should be used to assess the summary odds ratios (ORs) of each study. ORs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the strength of association. On the basis of the included criteria, we selected 39 papers, among which eight for -11426A &gt; G, 14 for -11391G &gt; A, 21 for -11377C &gt; G, 28 for +45 T &gt; G and 24 for +276G &gt; T. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the stability of the results. Both Begg's funnel plots and Egger's test are commonly used to evaluate publication bias. Overall, we found that individuals with the -11426G allele had a 0.15-fold significantly increased T2DM risk (additive model: 1.15, 1.04-1.27, 0.222). In the stratified analyses, we found that the -11426A &gt; G, -11391G &gt; A and -11377C &gt; G polymorphisms could increase T2DM risk in European populations in the additive model. For Asian populations, we found that the -11377C &gt; G polymorphism also could elevate T2DM risk. Our results suggested that the adiponectin -11426A &gt; G polymorphism could contribute to the T2DM risk.",

Recruited were 72 patients with unstable angina (UA) or non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) at Department of Integrative Medicine, First Affiliated Hospital of Xinxiang Medical College from August 2010 to June 2011. They were randomly assigned to the treatment group (36 cases) and the control group (36 cases). All patients were treated by routine treatment, but patients in the treatment group took GFD additionally. The course of treatment was four weeks. According to the severity degree, all patients were graded to four ranks: low-risk group of UA, medium-risk group of UA, high-risk group of UA, and NSTEMI. The levels of YKL-40 and hs-CRP, and the correlation of severity degree were analyzed. Before and after treatment levels of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were measured. Before treatment, at two weeks, and after treatment the serum levels of YKL-40 and hs-CRP were detected. The relationship of YKL-40, hs-CRP and the severity of the disease were analyzed. Levels of YKL-40 and hs-CRP were positively correlated with the severity of the disease respectively (r = 0.729, P &lt; 0.05; r = 0.655, P &lt; 0.05). The positive correlation also existed between YKL-40 and hs-CRP (r = 0.848, P &lt; 0.05). There was no statistical difference in the levels of blood lipids, YKL-40, or hs-CRP between the two groups before treatment (P &gt; 0.05). Compared with before treatment, the levels of YKL-40 and hs-CRP significantly decreased in both groups after two weeks of treatment (P &lt; 0.05). The levels of TG, TC, LDL-C, YKL-40, and hs-CRP significantly decreased, while the HDL-C level increased in both groups after treatment (P &lt; 0.05). The level of HDL-C in the treatment group was higher, while levels of YKL-40 and hs-CRP were lower after treatment, when compared with the control group (all P &lt; 0.05). On the basis of anti-inflammation and adjusting blood lipids by Western medicine, GFD could further reduce the serum levels of YKL-40 and hs-CRP of ACS patients, elevate the HDL-C level, and play anti-atherosclerosis effects.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological data has established increasing adiposity as a risk factor for incident asthma. However, the mechanisms underlying the association between obesity and asthma are incompletely understood. In the present paper, we review current knowledge of possible mechanisms mediating the observed association between obesity and asthma. Systematic literature review. Obesity and asthma share some etiological factors, such as a common genetic predisposition and effects of in utero conditions, and may also have common predisposing factors such as physical activity and diet. Obesity results in important changes in the mechanical properties of the respiratory system which could explain the occurrence of asthma. However, there are also plausible biological mechanisms whereby obesity could be expected to either cause or worsen asthma. These include co-morbidities such as gastro-oesophageal reflux, complications from sleep-disordered breathing, breathing at low lung volumes, chronic systemic inflammation, and endocrine factors, including adipokines and reproductive hormones. Obesity related asthma is in general not associated with eosinophilic airway inflammation, and adipokines are likely to play important roles in the inflammatory pathogenesis of asthma in obese individuals. The association between obesity and asthma is not straightforward, and further knowledge is clearly needed, as understanding the underlying mechanisms may lead to new therapeutic options for this high-risk part of the asthma population.",

A sample of 261 obese subjects were enrolled in a consecutive prospective way, from May 2011 to July 2012 in a tertiary hospital. In the basal visit, patients were randomly allocated during 3 months to Diet M (high monounsaturated fat hypocaloric diet) and Diet P (high polyunsaturated fat hypocaloric diet). One hundred and ninety seven patients (73.2%) had the genotype G-308G and 64 (26.8%) patients had the genotype G-308A. There were no significant differences between the effects (on weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, fat mass) in either genotype group with both diets.

Cross-sectional analysis of antiretroviral therapy-naive persons enrolled into a randomized clinical trial. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry for BMD and lean and fat mass and a laboratory assessment were performed. Soluble biomarkers included adipocytokines (leptin and adiponectin), inflammatory markers (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and interleukin 6), and markers related to bone metabolism [osteoprotegerin (OPG)], receptor activator of nuclear factor &#x3ba;B ligand. BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck was expressed as a Z score (number of standard deviations away from age-, race-, and sex-matched reference population). Three hundred thirty-one subjects had a median (Q1, Q3) age of 36 (28, 45) years, were 89% men, and 44% white. The prevalence of low BMD (Z score &#x2264; -2 at any of the 3 sites) was 10%.

In a linear model adjusting for age, gender, race, and total fat mass, lower lumbar spine Z scores were associated with lower total lean mass, higher serum adiponectin, and lower OPG. Results at the total hip or femoral neck were similar. Among antiretroviral therapy-naive HIV-infected individuals, lower BMD was associated with lower lean mass, higher adiponectin, and lower OPG, but not HIV disease variables or any of the inflammatory markers.

However, the exact mechanisms underlying the effects of omega-3 PUFA in humans have not yet been fully clarified. We sought to evaluate omega-3 PUFA-mediated effects on adipokines in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We conducted a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study, in which adiponectin, leptin and resistin were determined at baseline, 3-5 days and 30 days during administration of omega-3 PUFA 1 g/day (n=20) or placebo (n=28). As compared to controls administration of omega-3 PUFA resulted in increase of adiponectin by 13.4% (P&lt;0.0001), reduction of leptin by 22% (P&lt;0.0001) and increase of adiponectin to leptin (A/L) ratio by 45.5% (P&lt;0.0001) at 30 days, but not at 3-5 days. Compared with placebo adiponectin was 12.7% higher (P=0.0042), leptin was 16.7% lower (P&lt;0.0001) and A/L ratio was 33.3% higher (P&lt;0.0001) in the omega-3 PUFA group at 30 days. Resistin decreased similarly in both groups after 1 month, without intergroup differences (P=0.32). The multivariate model showed that the independent predictors of changes in adiponectin at 1 month (P&lt;0.001) were: omega-3 PUFA treatment, baseline platelet count, total cholesterol and those in leptin (P&lt;0.0001) were: omega-3 PUFA treatment and waist circumference. Independent predictors of A/L ratio changes (P&lt;0.0001) were: assigned treatment, current smoking and hyperlipidemia. In high risk stable coronary patients after PCI omega-3 PUFA supplementation improves adipokine profile in circulating blood. This might be a novel, favourable mechanism of omega-3 PUFA action.",

    "abstract": "The OLmesartan on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis: evaluation by IntraVascular UltraSound (OLIVUS) trial demonstrated that an angiotensin II receptor blocker, olmesartan, reduces the rate of coronary atheroma progression as evaluated by intravascular ultrasound in patients with stable angina pectoris undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. This substudy examined the impact of olmesartan on serum biomarkers and the relationship between biomarker changes and atheroma progression. Patients in the OLIVUS trial (n = 247) were randomly assigned to a control group or the olmesartan group. A subgroup of these patients (n = 135, 55 %) was analyzed at baseline and at 14 months. Patients' characteristics and blood-pressure control were identical between the control group (n = 65) and the olmesartan group (n = 70), and also between the subpopulation and total population. The change in the level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (mg/l) and adiponectin (&#x3bc;g/ml) was significantly greater in the olmesartan group than in the control group (between-group differences: 0.5 and -0.7; 95 % confidence interval: 0.2-0.8 and -1.3 to -0.1; P = 0.001 and 0.02, respectively). Multiple regression analysis revealed that the nominal changes in total atheroma volume and percent atheroma volume were significantly associated with the nominal change in hs-CRP in the olmesartan group but not in the control group. Olmesartan reduced hs-CRP in patients with stable angina, and this correlated with the change in coronary atheroma.",

Randomized controlled trial. Clinical research center at an academic medical university. Seventeen women with FHA were randomized either to CBT or observation. CBT versus observation. Circulatory concentrations of cortisol, leptin, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), total and free thyronine (T(3)), and total and free thyroxine (T(4)) before and immediately after completion of CBT or observation.

There were no changes in cortisol, leptin, TSH, T(3), or T(4) levels in women randomized to observation. Women treated with CBT showed increased levels of leptin and TSH, but their levels of T(3) and T(4) remained unchanged. In women with FHA, CBT ameliorated hypercortisolism and improved the neuroendocrine and metabolic concomitants of FHA while observation did not. We conclude that a cognitive, nonpharmacologic approach aimed at alleviating problematic attitudes not only can restore ovarian activity but also improve neuroendocrine and metabolic function in women with FHA.

    "abstract": "Obesity is a key factor in the development of the metabolic syndrome (MetS), which is associated with increased cardiometabolic risk. We investigated whether obesity classification by BMI and body fat percentage (BF%) influences cardiometabolic profile and dietary responsiveness in 486 MetS subjects (LIPGENE dietary intervention study). Anthropometric measures, markers of inflammation and glucose metabolism, lipid profiles, adhesion molecules, and hemostatic factors were determined at baseline and after 12 weeks of four dietary interventions (high saturated fat (SFA), high monounsaturated fat (MUFA), and two low fat high complex carbohydrate (LFHCC) diets, one supplemented with long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFAs)). About 39 and 87% of subjects classified as normal and overweight by BMI were obese according to their BF%. Individuals classified as obese by BMI (&#x2265; 30 kg/m(2)) and BF% (&#x2265; 25% (men) and &#x2265; 35% (women)) (OO, n = 284) had larger waist and hip measurements, higher BMI and were heavier (P &lt; 0.001) than those classified as nonobese by BMI but obese by BF% (NOO, n = 92). OO individuals displayed a more proinflammatory (higher C reactive protein (CRP) and leptin), prothrombotic (higher plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1)), proatherogenic (higher leptin/adiponectin ratio) and more insulin resistant (higher HOMA-IR) metabolic profile relative to the NOO group (P &lt; 0.001). Interestingly, tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1; (TNF-&#x3b1;) concentrations were lower post-intervention in NOO individuals compared with OO subjects (P &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, assessing BF% and BMI as part of a metabotype may help to identify individuals at greater cardiometabolic risk than BMI alone.",

    "abstract": "The plasma concentration of adiponectin, an adipokine that has anti-inflammatory, anti-atherogenic and insulin sensitizing properties, is lower in obese subjects and could therefore be a target for therapy. In order to review and meta-analyse prospective cohort studies investigating adiponectin concentration and the risk for incident coronary heart disease (CHD) or stroke, a systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases was performed. Two independent reviewers selected prospective cohort studies investigating the relationship between adiponectin level and incident CHD or stroke using 'adiponectin' and 'cardiovascular disease' or 'stroke' and their synonyms, excluding patients with clinically manifest vascular disease. Random-effects models were used to calculate pooled relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Generalized least squares regression was used to assess dose-response relationships for adiponectin concentrations from studies that provided RRs solely based upon categorical data regression. In total, 16 prospective cohort studies, comprising 23,919 patients and 6,870 CHD or stroke outcome events, were included in the meta-analyses. An increase of 1 standard deviation in log-transformed adiponectin did not lower the risk for CHD (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.86-1.09). A 10&#x2009;&#x3bc;g&#xa0;mL(-1) increase in adiponectin conferred a RR of 0.91 (95% CI 0.80-1.03) for CHD and a RR 1.01 (95% CI 0.97-1.06) for stroke. In conclusion, plasma adiponectin is not related to the risk for incident CHD or stroke.",

    "abstract": "Many studies have assessed the association between serum adiponectin and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), yet whether adiponectin is an independent risk factor for CVD remains controversial. We performed a meta-analysis of 17 prospective epidemiologic studies to evaluate this relationship in the general population. PubMed and Embase databases were searched through June 2012 to identify studies meeting a priori inclusion criteria, in addition to conducting a secondary reference review. Two principle investigators respectively extracted the information with either fixed-effect model or random-effect model to calculate the relationship between adiponectin and the risk of CVD. We summarized 17 prospective studies with a total of 23,717 participants. Overall, higher serum adiponectin was related to an increased risk of ischemic stroke: pooled risk ratio (RR) of 1.34 [95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.06-1.69] with no heterogeneity (Q = 1.23; P = 0.541). Serum adiponectin was not related to coronary heart disease (CHD) or CVD: pooled RR of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.85-1.08) and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.89-1.13), respectively. Increased serum adiponectin was related to an elevated risk of ischemic stroke, but there was no clear evidence indicating a positive relationship between adiponectin and the risk of CHD or CVD.",

We recently reported that C1q-APN/Total-APN ratio rather than Total-APN correlated with atherosclerosis in diabetics. However, the characteristics of C1q-APN in HD patients remain unclear. The preset study investigated the characteristics of the adiponectin parameters including C1q-APN and also to clarify the relationship between various serum adiponectin parameters and atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ACVD) in HD patients. The single cross-sectional study subjects were 117 Japanese patients (males/females = 61/56) on regular HD. Blood Total-APN, high molecular weight-adiponectin (HMW-APN), C1q-APN and C1q concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. ACVD were defined as stroke, coronary and peripheral artery diseases, thoracic and abdominal aneurysms. Stepwise regression analysis identified high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) as the only significant and independent determinant of C1q-APN in males, and duration of HD as the only significant and independent determinant of C1q-APN in females. Stepwise regression analysis identified uric acid, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and triglyceride as significant and independent determinants of C1q-APN/Total-APN ratio in males, and leukocyte count and HDL-C as significant and independent determinants of C1q-APN/Total-APN ratio in females. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified inorganic phosphorus and C1q-APN or C1q-APN/C1q ratio as significant determinants of ACVD.

Because of its critical role in regulating insulin sensitivity, resistin has been implicated in the physiopathology of GD. The aim of this study was to review the existing literature on the relationship between circulating maternal resistin levels and GD. Three electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS) were searched for pertinent studies published from 2001 to 2012, without language restrictions. Eleven studies, with a total of 639 participants between 23 and 41 weeks of gestation, were included. The number of GD patients per study ranged from 11 to 81, with varying degrees of disease severity and several different GD diagnostic criteria. Mean concentrations of resistin varied widely both in control women (0.05-22.21 ng/ml) and in GD patients (0.05-62.38 ng/ml). We performed a meta-analysis including a total of 10 studies, and also subgroup analyses according to gestational age at sample collection (up to 32 and &gt;33 weeks). The pooled absolute mean difference (WMD) in resistin levels was slightly lower in GD patients than in controls, but this did not reach statistical significance (WMD=-0.02, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.04). According to the data from the 11 studies analyzed, there was no association between circulating resistin levels and GD. However, this result should be interpreted with caution owing to the large heterogeneity amongst the existing published studies.",

One proposed mechanism linking obesity to chronic diseases is an alteration in adipose-derived adiponectin and leptin levels. We investigated the effects of 12-month reduced calorie, weight loss and exercise interventions on adiponectin and leptin concentrations. Overweight/obese postmenopausal women (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;439) were randomized as follows: (i) a reduced calorie, weight-loss diet (diet; N&#xa0;=&#xa0;118), (ii) moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic exercise (exercise; N&#xa0;=&#xa0;117), (iii) a combination of a reduced calorie, weight-loss diet and moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic exercise (diet&#xa0;+&#xa0;exercise; N&#xa0;=&#xa0;117), and (iv) control (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;87). The reduced calorie diet had a 10% weight-loss goal. The exercise intervention consisted of 45&#xa0;min of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic activity 5&#xa0;days per week. Adiponectin and leptin levels were measured at baseline and after 12&#xa0;months of intervention using a radioimmunoassay. Adiponectin increased by 9.5% in the diet group and 6.6% in the diet&#xa0;+&#xa0;exercise group (both P&#xa0;&#x2264;&#xa0;0.0001 vs. control). Compared with controls, leptin decreased with all interventions (diet&#xa0;+&#xa0;exercise, -40.1%, P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.0001; diet, -27.1%, P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.0001; exercise, -12.7%, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.005). The results were not influenced by the baseline body mass index (BMI). The degree of weight loss was inversely associated with concentrations of adiponectin (diet, P-trend&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0002; diet&#xa0;+&#xa0;exercise, P-trend&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0005) and directly associated with leptin (diet, P-trend&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.0001; diet&#xa0;+&#xa0;exercise, P-trend&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.0001). Weight loss through diet or diet&#xa0;+&#xa0;exercise increased adiponectin concentrations. Leptin concentrations decreased in all of the intervention groups, but the greatest reduction occurred with diet&#xa0;+&#xa0;exercise. Weight loss and exercise exerted some beneficial effects on chronic diseases via effects on adiponectin and leptin.",

Insulin sensitivity (IS; euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp), acute insulin response to glucose (AIR; intravenous glucose tolerance test), disposition index (DI = AIR &#xd7; IS measured by clamp), lipid profile, adipokine profile (leptin, adiponectin, resistin, visfatin, interleukin-6, TNF-&#x3b1;, MCP-1), ultra-sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP), body composition, and abdominal fat echography were assessed prior to surgery and 1, 6, and 12 months post-surgery. Omentectomy was associated with greater weight loss at all time points. IS improved similarly in both groups. Omentectomy was associated to lower CRP after 12 months, but it did not influence adipokines and other metabolic parameters. Among non-diabetic subjects, omentectomy was associated with a preservation of baseline AIR after 12 months (as opposed to deterioration in the control group) and a greater DI after 6 and 12 months. Although omentectomy did not enhance the effect of RYGBP on insulin sensitivity and adipokines, it was associated with a preservation of insulin secretion, a greater weight loss, and lower CRP.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiologic studies link short sleep duration to obesity and weight gain. Insufficient sleep appears to alter circulating levels of the hormones leptin and ghrelin, which may promote appetite, although the effects of sleep restriction on caloric intake and energy expenditure are unclear. We sought to determine the effect of 8 days/8 nights of sleep restriction on caloric intake, activity energy expenditure, and circulating levels of leptin and ghrelin. We conducted a randomized study of usual sleep vs a sleep restriction of two-thirds of normal sleep time for 8 days/8 nights in a hospital-based clinical research unit. The main outcomes were caloric intake, activity energy expenditure, and circulating levels of leptin and ghrelin. Caloric intake in the sleep-restricted group increased by +559 kcal/d (SD, 706 kcal/d, P=.006) and decreased in the control group by -118 kcal/d (SD, 386 kcal/d, P=.51) for a net change of +677 kcal/d (95% CI, 148-1,206 kcal/d; P=.014). Sleep restriction was not associated with changes in activity energy expenditure (P=.62). No change was seen in levels of leptin (P=.27) or ghrelin (P=.21). Sleep restriction was associated with an increase in caloric consumption with no change in activity energy expenditure or leptin and ghrelin concentrations. Increased caloric intake without any accompanying increase in energy expenditure may contribute to obesity in people who are exposed to long-term sleep restriction.

    "title": "Selective capacity of metreleptin administration to reconstitute CD4+ T-cell number in females with acquired hypoleptinemia.",
    "abstract": "Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone that controls food intake and reproductive and immune functions in rodents. In uncontrolled human studies, low leptin levels are associated with impaired immune responses and reduced T-cell counts; however, the effects of leptin replacement on the adaptive immune system have not yet been reported in the context of randomized, controlled studies and/or in conditions of chronic acquired leptin deficiency. To address these questions, we performed a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of recombinant methionyl-human leptin (metreleptin) administration in replacement doses in women experiencing the female triad (hypothalamic amenorrhea) with acquired chronic hypoleptinemia induced by negative energy balance. Metreleptin restored both CD4(+) T-cell counts and their in vitro proliferative responses in these women. These changes were accompanied by a transcriptional signature in which genes relevant to cell survival and hormonal response were up-regulated, and apoptosis genes were down-regulated in circulating immune cells. We also observed that signaling pathways involved in cell growth/survival/proliferation, such as the STAT3, AMPK, mTOR, ERK1/2, and Akt pathways, were activated directly by acute in vivo metreleptin administration in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CD4(+) T-cells both from subjects with chronic hypoleptinemia and from normoleptinemic, lean female subjects. Our data show that metreleptin administration, in doses that normalize circulating leptin levels, induces transcriptional changes, activates intracellular signaling pathways, and restores CD4(+) T-cell counts. Thus, metreleptin may prove to be a safe and effective therapy for selective CD4(+) T-cell immune reconstitution in hypoleptinemic states such as tuberculosis and HIV infection in which CD4(+) T cells are reduced.",

    "abstract": "The beneficial effects of &#x3c9;-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in cardiovascular disease are partly attributed to their anti-inflammatory properties. Their potential effect on the adipose tissue of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients has never been explored. To determine the metabolic effect of supplementation with two different doses of fish oil (FO), 12 non-dialyzed patients with stage IV/V CKD were randomly allocated to receive 1.8 g or 3.6 g/d of &#x3c9;-3 PUFA for 10 wk. Metabolic parameters, adipose tissue function, and gene expression were evaluated at baseline and 10 wk. Body weight, fat mass, energy intake, fasting glucose, and insulin were unchanged. The daily intake of 3.6 g of &#x3c9;-3 PUFA resulted in decreased serum triacylglycerol and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, whereas low-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased with 1.8 g of &#x3c9;-3 PUFA. Serum adiponectin, leptin, C-reactive protein, and tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1; were not modified in either group. Interleukin-6 levels tended to decrease with 1.8 g of &#x3c9;-3 PUFA. Additionally, a subset of inflammation-related genes (CD68 and MMP9) was reduced in subcutaneous adipose tissue in this group. Adiponectin, leptin, and adipoR2 gene expression were upregulated with 3.6 g of &#x3c9;-3 PUFA. A moderate dose of FO alters the gene expression profile of adipose tissue to a more antiinflammatory status. Higher doses of FO have a favorable effect on lipid profile and lead to the upregulation of adipokines gene expression suggesting a different dose response to &#x3c9;-3 PUFA administration in patients with CKD.",

    "abstract": "Chronic sub-acute inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. High doses of salicylate reduce inflammation, glucose and triacylglycerols, and may improve insulin sensitivity, suggesting therapeutic potential in impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance. This trial aimed to evaluate the effect of salsalate vs placebo on insulin resistance and glycaemia in impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance. We conducted a 12 week, two-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of salsalate (up to 4 g/day) vs placebo on systemic glucose disposal. Secondary objectives included treatment effects on glycaemia, inflammation and cardiovascular risk factors. Seventy-eight participants with impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance from two VA healthcare systems were enrolled. Randomisation assignment was provided by the coordinating center directly to site pharmacists, and participants and research staff were blinded to treatment assignment. Seventy-one individuals were randomised to placebo (n = 36) or salsalate (n = 35). Glucose disposal did not change in either group (salsalate 1% [95% CI -39%, 56%]; placebo 6% [95% CI -20%, 61%], p = 0.3 for placebo vs salsalate). Fasting glucose was reduced by 6% during the study by salsalate (p = 0.006) but did not change with placebo. Declines in glucose were accompanied by declines in fasting C-peptide with salsalate. Insulin clearance was reduced with salsalate. In the salsalate group, triacylglycerol levels were lower by 25% (p = 0.01) and adiponectin increased by 53% (p = 0.02) at the end of the study. Blood pressure, endothelial function and other inflammation markers did not differ between groups. Adipose tissue nuclear factor &#x3ba;B (NF-&#x3ba;B) activity declined in the salsalate group compared with placebo (-16% vs 42%, p = 0.005), but was not correlated with metabolic improvements. The frequency of tinnitus was low but tended to be higher with salsalate therapy (n = 4 vs n = 2). In summary, salsalate therapy was well tolerated, lowered fasting glucose, increased adiponectin and reduced adipose tissue NF-&#x3ba;B activity. These changes were not related to changes in peripheral insulin sensitivity, suggesting additional mechanisms for metabolic improvement. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00330733.

    "abstract": "Fetal growth restraint, if followed by rapid weight gain, confers risk for adult disease including diabetes. How breast-feeding may lower such risk is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE, STUDY PARTICIPANTS, INTERVENTION, OUTCOMES: In infants born small-for-gestational-age (SGA), we studied the effects of nutrition in early infancy (breast-feeding vs formula-feeding; BRF vs FOF) on weight partitioning and endocrine markers in late infancy. Body composition (by absorptiometry), fasting glycemia, insulin, IGF-I, and high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin were assessed at 4 and 12 months in BRF controls born appropriate-for-GA (N = 31) and in SGA infants receiving BRF (N = 48) or FOF (N = 51), the latter being randomized to receive a standard formula (FOF1) or a protein-rich formula (FOF2). The study was conducted in a University Hospital. SGA-BRF infants maintained a low fat mass and normal levels of IGF-I and HMW adiponectin. In contrast, SGA-FOF infants normalized their body composition by gaining more fat; this normalization was accompanied by a marked fall in HMW adiponectinemia and, in FOF2 infants, by elevated IGF-I levels. In late infancy, SGA-BRF infants were most sensitive to insulin, even more sensitive than appropriate-for-GA-BRF controls. Because the health perspectives are better for SGA-BRF than for SGA-FOF infants, the present results suggest that FOF for SGA infants should aim at maintaining normal IGF-I and HMW-adiponectin levels rather than at normalizing body composition. Nutriceutical research for SGA infants may thus have to be redirected.",

    "abstract": "Increased arterial stiffness is associated with enhanced risk of cardiovascular disease in obese individuals. Whether n3 fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) supplementation improves arterial stiffness in obese participants on a weight loss diet has not yet been investigated. The objective of the study was to carry out a 12-wk randomized, single-blind trial to test the effect of a 25% energy deficit weight loss diet alone (WL) (n = 12) or WL plus 4 g/d Omacor (46% EPA and 38% DHA) supplementation (WL+FAEE) (n = 13) on arterial elasticity in obese adults. Large (C1) and small artery elasticity (C2) were measured by pulse contour analysis of the radial artery. WL alone reduced (P &lt; 0.05 in all) body weight (-3%), waist circumference (-4%), systolic (-3%) and diastolic (-3%) blood pressures, cardiac output (-4%), plasma TG concentration (-25%), and the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) score (-12%) and increased plasma HDL cholesterol (+9%) and adiponectin (+18%) concentrations. However, WL alone did not alter C1 and C2. The WL+FAEE intervention significantly reduced body weight (-4%), waist circumference (-4%), systolic (-8%) and diastolic (-5%) blood pressures, pulse pressure (-5%), heart rate (-8%), plasma TG concentration (-36%), and HOMA score (-12%) and increased stroke volume (+3%), plasma HDL cholesterol (+6%) and adiponectin concentrations (+28%), and C1 (+20%) and C2 (+22%) artery elasticity. The changes in systolic blood pressure, heart rate, plasma TGs, C1, and C2 were significantly greater in the WL+FAEE group than in the WL group. Supplementation with n3 FAEEs improves C1 and C2 independently of weight loss in obese adults.",

    "abstract": "Adipose tissue plays a role in obesity-related cancers via increased production of inflammatory factors, steroid hormones, and altered adipokines. The impact of weight loss on adipose tissue gene expression may provide insights into pathways linking obesity with cancer risk. We conducted an ancillary study within a randomized trial of diet, exercise, or combined diet + exercise versus control among overweight/obese postmenopausal women. In 45 women, subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies were conducted at baseline and after 6 months, and changes in adipose tissue gene expression were determined by microarray with an emphasis on prespecified candidate pathways as well as by unsupervised clustering of more than 37,000 transcripts (Illumina). Analyses were conducted first by randomization group and then by degree of weight change at 6-months in all women combined. At 6 months, diet, exercise, and diet + exercise participants lost a mean of 8.8, 2.5, and 7.9 kg (all P &lt; 0.05 vs. no change in controls). There was no significant change in candidate gene expression by intervention group. In analysis by weight change category, greater weight loss was associated a decrease in 17&#x3b2;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 (HSD17B1, Ptrend &lt; 0.01) and leptin (LEP, Ptrend &lt; 0.01) expression, and marginally significant increased expression of estrogen receptor-1 (ESR1, Ptrend = 0.08) and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP3, Ptrend = 0.08). Unsupervised clustering revealed 83 transcripts with statistically significant changes. Multiple gene expression changes correlated with changes in associated serum biomarkers. Weight loss was associated with changes in adipose tissue gene expression after 6 months, particularly in two pathways postulated to link obesity and cancer, that is, steroid hormone metabolism and IGF signaling.

    "title": "Genome-wide meta-analysis of genetic susceptible genes for Type 2 Diabetes.",
    "abstract": "Many genetic studies, including single gene studies and Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), aim to identify risk alleles for genetic diseases such as Type II Diabetes (T2D). However, in T2D studies, there is a significant amount of the hereditary risk that cannot be simply explained by individual risk genes. There is a need for developing systems biology approaches to integrate comprehensive genetic information and provide new insight on T2D biology. We performed comprehensive integrative analysis of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP's) individually curated from T2D GWAS results and mapped them to T2D candidate risk genes. Using protein-protein interaction data, we constructed a T2D-specific molecular interaction network consisting of T2D genetic risk genes and their interacting gene partners. We then studied the relationship between these T2D genes and curated gene sets. We determined that T2D candidate risk genes are concentrated in certain parts of the genome, specifically in chromosome 20. Using the T2D genetic network, we identified highly-interconnected network hub genes. By incorporating T2D GWAS results, T2D pathways, and T2D genes' functional category information, we further ranked T2D risk genes, T2D-related pathways, and T2D-related functional categories. We found that highly-interconnected T2D disease network hub genes most highly associated to T2D genetic risks to be PI3KR1, ESR1, and ENPP1. The well-characterized TCF7L2, contractor to our expectation, was not among the highest-ranked T2D gene list. Many interacted pathways play a role in T2D genetic risks, which includes insulin signalling pathway, type II diabetes pathway, maturity onset diabetes of the young, adipocytokine signalling pathway, and pathways in cancer. We also observed significant crosstalk among T2D gene subnetworks which include insulin secretion, regulation of insulin secretion, response to peptide hormone stimulus, response to insulin stimulus, peptide secretion, glucose homeostasis, and hormone transport. Overview maps involving T2D genes, gene sets, pathways, and their interactions are all reported. Large-scale systems biology meta-analyses of GWAS results can improve interpretations of genetic variations and genetic risk factors. T2D genetic risks can be attributable to the summative genetic effects of many genes involved in a broad range of signalling pathways and functional networks. The framework developed for T2D studies may serve as a guide for studying other complex diseases.",

Because inflammation underlies all these metabolic conditions, it is plausible that the potential role of vitamin K in glucose metabolism occurs through the modulation of cytokines and related molecules. The purpose of the study was to assess the associations between dietary intake of vitamin K and peripheral adipokines and other metabolic risk markers related to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cross-sectional and longitudinal assessments of these associations in 510 elderly participants recruited in the PREDIMED centers of Reus and Barcelona (Spain). We determined 1-year changes in dietary phylloquinone intake estimated by food frequency questionnaires, serum inflammatory cytokines and other metabolic risk markers. In the cross-sectional analysis at baseline no significant associations were found between dietary phylloquinone intake and the rest of metabolic risk markers evaluated, with exception of a negative association with plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. After 1-year of follow-up, subjects in the upper tertile of changes in dietary phylloquinone intake showed a greater reduction in ghrelin (-15.0%), glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (-12.9%), glucagon-like peptide-1 (-17.6%), IL-6 (-27.9%), leptin (-10.3%), TNF (-26.9%) and visfatin (-24.9%) plasma concentrations than those in the lowest tertile (all p&lt;0.05).

Non-hospitalized CAD patients are usually followed in general practice. There is a need for identify biomarkers which could help to foresee the prognoses of these patients. Elevated serum YKL-40 is a short-term predictor for myocardial infarction, cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality in patients with stable CAD. Serum YKL-40, hs-CRP, and NT-proBNP were measured in 4265 (97.6%) of the 4372 patients with stable CAD included in the CLARICOR trial, and death was registered in a 6-years follow-up period. The median serum YKL-40 was 110 &#x3bc;g/L [IQR=93], hs-CRP 2.8 mg/L [IQR=4.74], and NT-proBNP 203 ng/L [IQR=407]. During 6 years follow-up period 923 (21.1%) patients died. After adjustment for type of intervention, risk factors (age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, smoking status, and previous myocardial infarction) and medical treatment (diuretics, digoxin, and statin) serum YKL-40 (transformed as ln(max(82, YKL-40/&#x3bc;g/L)) was significantly associated with all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (HR)=1.55, 95% CI=1.39-1.73, p&lt;0.001]. After additional adjustment for ln(hs-CRP) and ln(NT-proBNP) this was still true [HR=1.38, 95% CI=1.21-1.53, p&lt;0.001]. Serum YKL-40 is a predictor of long-term mortality in patients with stable CAD independent of common risk factors and ln(hs-CRP) and ln(NT-proBNP).

Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess the associations. We retrieved the following databases: Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Wanfang, and the latest update date was 15th of August 2012. Odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) were calculated by using fixed- or random-effect model. Overall, there were 13 case-control studies consisting of 7,902 subjects for adiponectin rs1501299G/T, seven studies consisting of 6,209 subjects for rs822395A/C, and seven studies consisting of 5,791 subjects for rs822396A/G polymorphism in this study. Combined analyses indicated that neither adiponectin rs822395A/C nor rs822396A/G was associated with risk of cancer incidence (OR (95 % CI) 0.91 (0.77-1.77), P z test = 0.26 for CC vs. AA and 0.96 (0.87-1.05) for C carriers vs. A carriers, P z test = 0.33 for rs822395A/C; 0.88 (0.53-1.47) for GG vs. AA, P z test = 0.63 and 0.94 (0.84-1.04) for G carriers vs. A carriers, P z test = 0.24 for rs822396A/G polymorphism). Similarly, combined analysis also indicated that adiponectin rs1501299G/T polymorphism was not associated with risk of cancer development (OR (95 % CI) 0.86 (0.73-1.01) for TT vs. GG, P z test = 0.07 and 1.17 (0.98-1.39), P z test = 0.08). However, when stratified analyses were conducted, the result indicated that T allele was significantly associated with increased cancer risk for Caucasians (OR (95 % CI) 1.28 (1.06-1.64) and P z test = 0.01 for G carriers vs. T carriers) and associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer development while with decreased risk of prostate cancer incidence compared to G allele (OR (95 % CI) 1.34 (1.14-1.57), P z test &lt; 0.01 for G carriers vs. T carriers for colorectal cancer; 0.80 (0.65-0.97), P z test = 0.03 for TG vs. GG for prostate cancer). In summary, this meta-analysis indicated that adiponectin rs1501299G/T, rather than rs822395A/C and rs822396A/G polymorphism, was associated with risk of cancer development, especially for colorectal and prostate cancer.",

    "title": "Grape resveratrol increases serum adiponectin and downregulates inflammatory genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells: a triple-blind, placebo-controlled, one-year clinical trial in patients with stable coronary artery disease.",
    "abstract": "The grape and wine polyphenol resveratrol exerts cardiovascular benefits but evidence from randomized human clinical trials is very limited. We investigated dose-depending effects of a resveratrol-containing grape supplement on stable patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) treated according to currently accepted guidelines for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. In a triple-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, one-year follow-up, 3-arm pilot clinical trial, 75 stable-CAD patients received 350 mg/day of placebo, resveratrol-containing grape extract (grape phenolics plus 8 mg resveratrol) or conventional grape extract lacking resveratrol during 6 months, and a double dose for the following 6 months. Changes in circulating inflammatory and fibrinolytic biomarkers were analyzed. Moreover, the transcriptional profiling of inflammatory genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was explored using microarrays and functional gene expression analysis. After 1 year, in contrast to the placebo and conventional grape extract groups, the resveratrol-containing grape extract group showed an increase of the anti-inflammatory serum adiponectin (9.6 %, p = 0.01) and a decrease of the thrombogenic plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) (-18.6 %, p = 0.05). In addition, 6 key inflammation-related transcription factors were predicted to be significantly activated or inhibited, with 27 extracellular-space acting genes involved in inflammation, cell migration and T-cell interaction signals presenting downregulation (p &lt; 0.05) in PBMCs. No adverse effects were detected in relation to the study products. Chronic daily consumption of a resveratrol-containing grape nutraceutical could exert cardiovascular benefits in stable-CAD patients treated according to current evidence-based standards, by increasing serum adiponectin, preventing PAI-1 increase and inhibiting atherothrombotic signals in PBMCs.",

    "title": "ADIPOQ gene polymorphisms and cancer risk: a meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "The results of studies investigating the association between ADIPOQ gene polymorphisms and risk of cancer have been inconsistent and often contradictory. The present meta-analysis was conducted in order to overcome the limitations of any individual study and to provide a more precise overall effect estimate. Relevant studies were identified by searching PubMed and Embase for articles published through May 2012. The strength of the relationship between the ADIPOQ gene and risk of cancer was assessed using odds ratios (ORs). Either a fixed-effects or a random-effects model was used to calculate the overall risk estimates. Fifteen studies were included and five SNPs were considered. A significant association was found between SNP rs2241766 and risk of cancer in the recessive genetic model (OR: 0.768, 95% CI: [0.626,0.942], P=0.011); a significant relationship was also found between SNP rs1501299 and risk of cancer in both an allele contrast (OR: 0.141, 95%CI: [0.113,0.176], P&lt;0.001) and the dominant genetic model (OR: 0.904, 95%CI: [0.830,0.985], P=0.021); no association was found with the rs266729, rs822395, or rs822396 SNPs. Adjusted ORs were also considered, but no statistically significant association was found in homozygote contrasts for any of the five SNPs after adjustment. Our results suggest that two polymorphisms, SNP rs2241766 and SNP rs1501299, of the ADIPOQ gene may be associated with reduced risk of cancer. However, the overall strength of association is mild to moderate, and additional well-designed studies are needed to confirm the present conclusion.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States and the world. Clinical trials have suggested that soybean protein lowers lipids and blood pressure. The effect of soybean protein on novel CVD risk factors has not been well studied. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of soybean protein on biomarkers of inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and adipocytokines. The effect of 8 weeks of 40&#x2009;g of soybean protein supplement (89.3&#x2009;mg isoflavones), 40&#x2009;g of milk protein supplement and 40&#x2009;g of complex carbohydrate placebo was examined in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, three-phase crossover trial among adults in New Orleans, Louisiana and Jackson, Mississippi. Plasma levels of inflammation biomarkers (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1;), endothelial dysfunction biomarkers (E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, thrombomodulin) and adipocytokines (high-molecular weight adiponectin, leptin, resistin) were measured at baseline and at the end of each intervention using immunoturbidimetric and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques. Soy protein supplementation resulted in a significant mean net change (95% confidence interval) in plasma E-selectin of -3.93&#x2009;ng/ml (-7.05 to -0.81&#x2009;ng/ml; P=0.014) compared with milk protein, and in plasma leptin of -2089.8&#x2009;pg/ml (-3689.3 to -490.3&#x2009;pg/ml; P=0.011) compared with carbohydrate. There were no significant changes in any other risk factors. Soy protein supplementation may reduce levels of E-selectin and leptin. Further research is warranted to investigate the mechanisms through which protein may confer protective effects on novel CVD risk factors.",

CIMT was measured in 382 participants at the beginning and up to 3 additional times during follow-up of the Actos Now for Prevention of Diabetes trial. During an average follow-up of 2.3 years, the mean unadjusted annual rate of CIMT progression was significantly (P=0.01) lower with pioglitazone treatment (4.76&#xd7;10(-3) mm/year; 95% CI: 2.39&#xd7;10(-3)-7.14&#xd7;10(-3) mm/year) compared with placebo (9.69&#xd7;10(-3) mm/year; 95% CI: 7.24&#xd7;10(-3)-12.15&#xd7;10(-3) mm/year). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting and 2-hour glucose, HbA(1c), fasting insulin, Matsuda insulin sensitivity index, adiponectin, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels improved significantly with pioglitazone treatment compared with placebo (P&lt;0.001). However, the effect of pioglitazone on CIMT progression was not attenuated by multiple methods of adjustment for traditional, metabolic, and inflammatory risk factors and concomitant medications, and was independent of changes in risk factors during pioglitazone treatment. Pioglitazone slowed progression of CIMT, independent of improvement in hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and systemic inflammation in prediabetes. These results suggest a possible direct vascular benefit of pioglitazone.",

    "abstract": "Associations between adiponectin (ADIPOQ) genetic polymorphisms (rs2241766 G/T and rs266729 G/C) and cancer risk have been extensively studied in the past decade, while conflicting results were reported. Therefore, this study would explore the associations by using a meta-analysis. The databases of Medline, Embase, and Wangfang were retrieved, and the latest updated time was 1 August 2012. Effect sizes of odds ratio and 95&#xa0;% confidence interval (OR and 95&#xa0;% CI) were calculated by using a fixed- or random-effect model. A total of 12 studies with 10,368 participants were identified for association between ADIPOQ rs2241766 G/T and risk of cancer, and ten studies with 12,665 participants were for association between ADIPOQ rs266729 G/C and risk of cancer. Overall combined analyses indicated that neither ADIPOQ rs2241766 G/T nor rs266729 G/C was associated with risk of cancer incidence (OR (95&#xa0;% CI), 0.89 (0.61-1.30) for GG vs. TT and 0.94 (0.83-1.06) for G carriers vs. T carriers for rs2241766 G/T; 0.99 (0.85-1.16) for GG vs. CC and 0.96 (0.87-1.06) for G carriers vs. C carriers for rs266729 G/C). When stratified analyses were conducted according to the participants' ethnicity, sources of controls, types of cancer, and sample size, we found that G allele of ADIPOQ rs2241766 G/T was significantly associated with decreased risk of cancer based on population-based case-control studies (OR (95&#xa0;% CI), 0.65 (0.50-0.85) for GG vs. TT and 0.88 (0.79-0.98) for G carriers vs. T carriers). In contrast, there was no association between rs266729 G/C polymorphism and risk of cancer when subgroup analyses were conducted. In summary, this meta-analysis indicated that ADIPOQ rs2241766 G/T rather than rs266729 G/C polymorphism was closely associated with risk of cancer development.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin is the most abundant circulating protein secreted by adipocytes. There is uncertainty about the association between adiponectin levels and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). We conducted this meta-analysis to summarize the effect of adiponectin on the risk of CHD. A comprehensive search was performed to identify all prospective studies on the association of adiponectin levels and risk of CHD. The quality of the eligible studies was evaluated by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The fixed- or random-effects model was selected to pool the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity among studies was evaluated using Q test and the I&#xb2; statistic. Publication bias was estimated using modified Egger's linear regression test. Twelve prospective studies comprising 8 nested case-control studies and 4 cohort studies were included in the meta-analysis. A total of 14,960 participants were enrolled and 4,132 incident CHD events were observed. The pooled RR for CHD was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.69-0.98, P = 0.031). Subgroup analyses showed that the pooled RRs (95% CIs) for CHD risk were 0.78 (0.66-0.92) and 0.75 (0.59-0.94) for men and women, respectively. For studies with mean age less than 65 years, the pooled RR (95% CI) for CHD risk was 0.72 (0.59-0.87). For studies with 100 or more CHD cases, the pooled RR was marginally significant (RR = 0.83, 95% CI, 0.69-1.00; P = 0.051). No publication bias was found in our study (P = 0.911). This meta-analysis showed that higher levels of adiponectin were associated with a low risk of CHD. The protective effect was consistently existed in men and women and in the middle-aged populations.",

In this study we tested the hypothesis that elevated asymmetric dimethylarginine can be reduced in patients after kidney transplantation by early regular physical exercise. Selected cytokines and metabolic parameters were also analysed. Plasma samples for analysis of asymmetric dimethylarginine, adiponectin, leptin, soluble leptin receptor, resistin, visfatin, CRP, TNF&#x3b1; and selected metabolic parameters were obtained from randomly selected sixty eight patients after kidney transplantation who agreed to participate in a supervised aerobic exercise program for six months. Samples were collected before the training began (one month after surgery with stabilized graft function) and at six months after initiation. Sixty transplant patients matched for age, sex, HLA typing, duration of previous dialysis, history of cardiovascular disease and immunosupression regimen who did not exercise regularly and did not participate in the training program were examined as controls. There were no differences in elevated asymmetric dimethylarginine levels between both groups before the training program began. After six months of exercise, asymmetric dimethylarginine concentration in the exercising group I significantly decreased (3.5 &#xb1; 0.45 vs 2.11 &#xb1; 0.35 &#xb5;mol/L, P &lt; 0.01) and was also significantly lower comparing to non-exercising group II (2.11 &#xb1; 0.23 vs 3.25 &#xb1; 0.34 &#xb5;mol/L, P &lt; 0.01). We found significant changes in exercising group I: adiponectin (15.4 &#xb1; 6.6 vs 22.3 &#xb1; 6.2 mg/mL, P &lt; 0.01), leptin (51.3 &#xb1; 11.2 vs 20.3 &#xb1; 9.2 ng/L, P &lt; 0.01), soluble leptin receptor (24.6 &#xb1; 8.4 vs 46.1 &#xb1; 11.4 U/mL, P &lt; 0.01), resistin (20.8 &#xb1; 10.1 vs 14.6 &#xb1; 6.4 mg/mL, P &lt; 0.025) and visfatin (1.8 &#xb1; 0.2 vs 1.2 &#xb1; 0.01 ng/mL, P &lt; 0.05). Blood lipids, HbA1c, CRP and TNF&#x3b1; were also affected by the training program. Elevated asymmetric dimethylarginine level, selected adipocytokines and proinflammatory cytokines in patients after kidney transplantation were significantly influenced by early regular exercise. This regimen may decrease cardiovascular risk in patients after kidney transplantation.",

We aimed to evaluate the effects of different exercise modalities on the aforementioned novel adipokines and carotid intima-media thickness in patients with Type&#xa0;2 diabetes mellitus. One hundred patients with Type&#xa0;2 diabetes were equivalently (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;25) randomized into four groups: (1) a control group with patients encouraged to perform self-controlled exercise; (2) a supervised aerobic exercise group (exercise four times/week, 60&#xa0;min/session, 60-75% of maximum heart rate); (3) a resistance training group (60-80% baseline maximum load achieved in one repetition); and (4) a combined aerobic exercise plus resistance training group, as in groups&#xa0;2 and 3. All participants had HbA(1c) levels &#x2265;&#xa0;48&#xa0;mmol/mol (&#x2265;&#xa0;6.5%), without overt diabetic vascular complications. Blood samples, clinical characteristics, peak oxygen uptake and carotid intima-media thickness measurements were obtained at baseline and at the end of the study, after 6&#xa0;months. At baseline, there were non-significant differences between groups. All active groups significantly ameliorated glycaemic profile, insulin sensitivity and triglycerides levels compared with the control group (P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05). Aerobic training further improved lipids, systolic blood pressure and exercise capacity compared with the resistance training and the control groups (P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05). Moreover, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and visfatin decreased, while vaspin and apelin circulating levels increased within the aerobic exercise group and the aerobic exercise plus resistance training group, and compared with the other groups (P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05). Within- and between-group comparisons showed negligible alterations in ghrelin serum levels and body weight after all exercise modalities. Finally, aerobic training attenuated the carotid intima-media thickness progression (0.017&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.006&#xa0;mm) compared with the control subjects (0.129&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.042&#xa0;mm, P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001). That effect was independently associated with visfatin and amelioration of peak oxygen uptake. In subjects with Type&#xa0;2 diabetes, all exercise training modalities improved metabolic profile. Importantly, aerobic training predominantly ameliorated adipokines concentrations and carotid intima-media thickness progression.",

We examined the effect of caloric restriction (CR) on fetuin-A levels and concomitant changes in hepatic steatosis and cardiovascular risk factors in rats and humans. We performed a randomized, controlled clinical trial to examine circulating fetuin-A levels and cardiovascular risk parameters including visceral fat area (VFA), atherogenic lipid profile, inflammatory markers, adipokines levels and brachial artery endothelial function in 76 overweight women with type 2 diabetes before and after 12 weeks of CR. In addition, the effects of CR on hepatic steatosis and fetuin-A mRNA expression were evaluated in Otuska Long Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, an animal model of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Circulating fetuin-A levels were significantly decreased after 12 weeks of CR and were accompanied by improvements in VFA, blood pressure, glucose, lipid profiles and liver function. The CR group also showed a significant decrease in apolipoprotein B, leptin and insulin resistance compared to those in the control group, although endothelial function was not different. Multiple regression analysis showed that the changes in fetuin-A levels were independently associated with CR and changes in hsCRP and adiponectin (R&#xb2; = 0&#xb7;156). Moreover, CR significantly reduced hepatic steatosis and fetuin-A expression, as well as weight, glucose, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, in OLETF rats. Caloric restriction significantly reduced the hepatic expression of fetuin-A and its circulating levels and improved several cardiovascular risk factors in obese rats and humans with type 2 diabetes.",

A total of 15 case-control studies related rs266729 (5,615 cases and 6,425 controls), rs2241766 (5,318 cases and 6,118 controls) and rs1501299 (3,751 cases and 5,104 controls) were included to analyze the ADIPOQ polymorphisms and cancer risk. For rs1501299, T allele was associated with decreased cancer risk. In addition, cancer type subgroup analysis revealed T allele was associated with decreased colorectal and prostate cancer risk. Ethnicity subgroup analysis observed a decreased risk in both Asian and Caucasian descendents. As to rs2241766, a borderline decreased cancer risk was observed. This meta-analysis indicated T allele of rs1501299 was an obvious protection factor for cancer risk, and G allele of rs2241766 was a potential protection factor for cancer risk, especially in Caucasian descendents. Further studies should be performed to clarify the roles of ADIPOQ polymorphisms in the cancer risk.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to compare glucose, lipids, and C-reactive protein (CRP) in women with gestational diabetes mellitus treated with metformin or insulin and in cord plasma of their offspring and to examine how these markers relate to infant size at birth. Women with gestational diabetes mellitus were randomly assigned to metformin or insulin in the Metformin in Gestational Diabetes trial. Fasting maternal plasma glucose, lipids, and CRP were measured at randomization, 36 weeks' gestation, and 6-8 weeks postpartum as well as in cord plasma. Women with available cord blood samples (metformin n = 236, insulin n = 242) were included. Maternal plasma triglycerides increased more from randomization to 36 weeks' gestation in women treated with metformin (21.93%) versus insulin (9.69%, P &lt; 0.001). Maternal and cord plasma lipids, CRP, and neonatal anthropometry did not differ between treatments. In logistic regression analyses adjusted for confounders, the strongest associations with birth weight &gt;90th centile were maternal triglycerides and measures of glucose control at 36 weeks. There were few differences in circulating maternal and neonatal markers of metabolic status and no differences in measures of anthropometry between the offspring of women treated with metformin and the offspring of women treated with insulin. There may be subtle effects of metformin on maternal lipid function, but the findings suggest that treating gestational diabetes mellitus with metformin does not adversely affect lipids or CRP in cord plasma or neonatal anthropometric measures.",

    "abstract": "Although visceral obesity, a key abnormality in the metabolic syndrome, is an important risk for cardiovascular diseases, reduction in visceral fat is hard to achieve despite intensive efforts directed at lifestyle modification. The present study was designed to investigate whether ezetimibe, an inhibitor of intestinal cholesterol absorption through its binding to Niemann-Pick C1-like 1, reduces visceral fat in patients with metabolic syndrome. Seventy-eight outpatients (63&#xb7;7 &#xb1; 10&#xb7;4 years old) with metabolic syndrome were enroled and randomly assigned to receive either ezetimibe (10 mg/day) or nothing for 6 months. Changes in visceral fat were assessed by computed tomography. Treatment with ezetimibe significantly improved lipid profiles. Visceral fat was decreased 7&#xb7;2%, from 161&#xb7;3 &#xb1; 58&#xb7;6 cm(2) to 148&#xb7;4 &#xb1; 52&#xb7;7 cm(2) (P &lt; 0&#xb7;05), and adiponectin was increased 7&#xb7;7%, from 3&#xb7;61 &#xb1; 3&#xb7;10 &#x3bc;g/mL to 3&#xb7;86 &#xb1; 3&#xb7;62 &#x3bc;g/mL (P &lt; 0&#xb7;05), after ezetimibe therapy; these beneficial effects were not observed in the control group. The increase in the adiponectin level was correlated with the reduction in visceral fat after ezetimibe treatment. Furthermore, ezetimibe reduced fasting insulin levels (P &lt; 0&#xb7;05) and improved the homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (P &lt; 0&#xb7;05). Ezetimibe reduces visceral fat with beneficial effects on adiponectin and insulin resistance in patients with metabolic syndrome, suggesting a new therapeutic approach in such patients.",

The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on serum adiponectin levels and some metabolic risk factors in PCOS patients. This double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted on 64 overweight or obese PCOS patients; aged 20-35 years. Subjects in omega-3 fatty acids (n=32) and placebo (n=32) groups were given 4 omega- 3 fatty acids capsules (each one contained 180 mg eicosapentaenoic acid and 120 mg docosahexanoic acid) or placebo daily for 8 weeks. Fasting blood samples, anthropometric measurements and 3-day, 24-hour dietary recalls were collected at the baseline and at the end of the trial. The study was completed by 61 subjects. Omega-3 fatty acids significantly increased serum levels of adiponectin (p=0.003) and decreased glucose (p&lt;0.001), insulin (p=0.002), homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (p&lt;0.001), total cholesterol (p=0.002) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p=0.003) compared with placebo. Serum levels of triglyceride significantly decreased (p=0.024) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased (p=0.018) in the omega-3 fatty acids group, in comparison with baseline values. No significant changes were shown in serum high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels in both groups. Omega-3 fatty acids had some beneficial effects on serum adiponectin levels, insulin resistance and lipid profile in PCOS patients and may contribute to the improvement of metabolic complications in these patients.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological data suggest that moderate red wine consumption reduces cardiovascular mortality and the incidence of diabetes. However, whether these effects are due to ethanol or to non-alcoholic components of red wine still remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of moderate consumption of red wine, dealcoholized red wine, and gin on glucose metabolism and the lipid profile. Sixty-seven men at high cardiovascular risk were randomized in a crossover trial. After a run-in period, all received each of red wine (30&#xa0;g alcohol/d), the equivalent amount of dealcoholized red wine, and gin (30&#xa0;g alcohol/d) for 4 week periods, in a randomized order. Fasting plasma glucose and insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), plasma lipoproteins, apolipoproteins and adipokines were determined at baseline and after each intervention. Fasting glucose remained constant throughout the study, while mean adjusted plasma insulin and HOMA-IR decreased after red wine and dealcoholized red wine. HDL cholesterol, Apolipoprotein A-I and A-II increased after red wine and gin. Lipoprotein(a) decreased after the red wine intervention. These results support a beneficial effect of the non-alcoholic fraction of red wine (mainly polyphenols) on insulin resistance, conferring greater protective effects on cardiovascular disease to red wine than other alcoholic beverages. www.isrctn.org: ISRCTN88720134.",

    "abstract": "Insulin resistance (IR) is associated with increased cardiovascular risk in multiple patient populations, including those undergoing chronic hemodialysis (CHD). Active vitamin D deficiency has been proposed to play a role in the extent of IR observed in patients with CHD. We postulated that administration of paracalcitol, an active vitamin D medication, influences IR in patients with CHD. This was a pilot randomized controlled trial. Ten prevalent CHD patients receiving a stable dose of paracalcitol were recruited. Paracalcitol was withheld for 8 weeks in all patients (phase I). Parathyroid hormone levels were managed with the calcium-sensing receptor agonist cinacalcet. At week 8, patients were randomized to continue cinacalcet or to restart paracalcitol for 8 weeks (phase II). The primary outcome was the change in IR measured by the glucose disposal rate (GDR) using hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp (HEGC) method. Secondary outcomes included changes in IR between groups in indirect indices of IR, biomarkers of inflammation, and adipokine levels. The mean age was 49 years (range, 46-57 years) and 40% of patients were women. There was no detectable change in the GDR at the end of phase I (P = .7) when compared with baseline values. There was also no statistically significant difference in GDR between groups at the end of phase II (P = .9). No changes were observed in indirect indices of IR, adipokine levels, or biomarkers of inflammation in either phase. The results of this pilot study suggest that withdrawal of paracalcitol over 8 to 16 weeks and replacement for 8 weeks after withdrawal does not influence IR measured by HEGC in patients receiving CHD.",

    "title": "The effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor on insulin resistance in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis.",
    "abstract": "Insulin resistance is associated with the progression of atherosclerosis and is reported to predict cardiovascular mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Although statins exert pleiotropic effects, it is uncertain whether statin therapy improves insulin resistance in these patients. In this prospective randomized controlled trial, we aimed to evaluate the effects of statin on insulin resistance among 70 patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). Patients were randomized into a statin group (n = 35) or a control group (n = 35). The statin group received 10 mg per day of rosuvastatin for 6 months. We determined insulin resistance by homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index. Serum concentrations of adipokines such as adiponectin, leptin, and resistin were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assay. As inflammatory markers, high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin-6 were also measured. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups. Compared to baseline value, statin treatment significantly decreased HOMA-IR index from 2.37 &#xb1; 1.08 to 2.05 &#xb1; 0.82 (P = 0.014). There was a concordant decrease in hsCRP levels in the statin group (2.05 &#xb1; 1.57 to 1.21 &#xb1; 0.84 mg/L, P &lt; 0.001), but such improvements were not observed in the control group. When between-group differences in these parameters were compared, hsCRP levels were more decreased in the statin group than in the control group (P = 0.021 for between-group difference), whereas HOMA-IR index was not (P = 0.189 for between-group difference). During this period, statin treatment did not result in the improved adipokine profiles. This study showed that statin therapy failed to improve insulin resistance in PD patients despite a significant decline in hsCRP levels after statin treatment. Our finding suggests that reducing inflammation by statin is of limited help to fully attenuate insulin resistance in these patients.",

Long-term interdisciplinary weight-loss therapy (1 year of clinical, nutritional, psychological, and exercise-related intervention). Fifty-eight postpubertal obese adolescents were randomized to AT or AT+RT according to NAFLD diagnosis. Adipokine and neuropeptide concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, visceral fat by ultrasound, and body composition by plethysmography. The NAFLD group that followed the AT+RT protocol presented lower insulin, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and alanine transaminase (ALT) values after intervention compared with AT. It was verified that there was a higher magnitude of change in the subcutaneous fat, glycemia, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, ALT, and adiponectin in response to AT+RT than in the control group (AT). All patients who underwent the AT+RT exhibited significantly higher adiponectin, leptin, and &#x394;adiponectin and lower melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) concentrations after therapy compared with the AT group. In the simple linear regression analysis, changes in glycemia, insulin, and HOMA-IR were independent predictors of significant improvement in adiponectin concentration. Indeed, &#x394;AST (aspartate transaminase) and &#x394;GGT (&#x3b3;-glutamyl transpeptidase) were independent predictors of &#x394;ALT, while &#x394;fat mass and &#x394;AgRP (agouti-related protein) were independent predictors of &#x394;MCH. Although the number of patients was limited, we showed for the first time the positive effects of AT+RT protocol in a long-term interdisciplinary therapy to improve inflammatory biomarkers and to reduce orexigenic neuropeptide concentrations in NAFLD obese adolescents. The long-term interdisciplinary therapy with AT+RT protocol was more effective in significantly improving noninvasive biomarkers of NAFLD that are associated with the highest risk of disease progression in the pediatric population.",

The w6-polyunsaturated fatty acid content, in particular linoleic acid (18:2w6), of adipose tissue increased significantly more in the intervention group, but the magnitude of the change was small (+0.17 vs +0.02 percentage points for intervention vs control, P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Surprisingly leptin mRNA levels in adipose tissue increased in the intervention group (+107% intervention vs -20% control, P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05), but changes in expression of the remaining genes did not differ between the groups. After a 6-month period of increased physical activity in overweight elderly individuals, circulating leptin concentrations decreased despite increased levels of leptin mRNA in adipose tissue. Otherwise, only minor changes occurred in adipose tissue, although several improvements in metabolic parameters accompanied the modest increase in physical activity.",

    "abstract": "The ADIPOQ gene has been implicated in the etiology of hypertension. However, the results have been inconsistent. In this study, a meta-analysis was performed to assess the associations of ADIPOQ polymorphisms with hypertension risk among the Chinese. Published literature from PubMed, CNKI and Wanfang Data were retrieved. Pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence interval (CI) was calculated using fixed- or random-effects model. Six studies (1,812 cases and 2,631 controls) for rs2241766 polymorphism and four studies (1,449 cases and 2,175 controls) for rs1501299 polymorphism were identified. A marginally significant association was observed for rs2241766 polymorphism under recessive genetic model (GG vs. GT+TT: OR = 1.22, 95 % CI 1.01-1.48) and for rs1501299 polymorphism under heterogeneous co-dominant model (TG vs. GG: OR = 0.86, 95 % CI 0.75-0.99) and dominant model (TT+TG vs. GG: OR = 0.85, 95 % CI 0.74-0.98). In addition, under other genetic models, there was no significant association for rs2241766 polymorphism (GG vs. TT: OR = 1.20, 95 % CI 0.98-1.48; GT vs. TT: OR = 0.97, 95 % CI 0.85-1.10; GG+GT vs. TT: OR = 1.01, 95 % CI 0.90-1.15) and for rs1501299 polymorphism (TT vs. GG: OR = 0.82, 95 % CI 0.62-1.08; TT vs. TG+GG: OR = 0.87, 95 % CI 0.66-1.14). However, the associations above were not robust by sensitivity analysis. The present meta-analysis indicated the limited evidence of the significant associations between ADIPOQ gene polymorphisms and hypertension susceptibility among the Chinese.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin (adipo) and exercise training (ET) contribute to the maintenance of a normal vascular tone by influencing vascular NO bioavailability and concentration and function of circulating angiogenic cells (CAC). The molecular mechanisms are only partially understood. Aim of the present study was to elucidate the effects of adipo on CAC migration and the underlying signaling pathways. Furthermore, the impact of ET on adiponectin-mediated CAC migration was investigated. CACs were isolated from peripheral blood and exposed to different adipo concentrations. Adipo (5&#x3bc;g/ml) enhanced the ability of CACs to migrate following an SDF-1 gradient by 345%. This was associated with a significant increase in CXCR4 expression on the surface of CACs as compared to control (10.1 &#xb1; 1.5 vs. 33.2 &#xb1; 4.5% CXCR4 positive cells, p&lt;0.05). Adiponectin-induced CAC migration and CXCR4-upregulation were mediated through adipo-receptor 1 (AdipoR1) and blocked by an inhibitor of PI3-kinase, p38MAP kinase and NF&#x3ba;b. Adipo-stimulated migration of CACs, CXCR4 expression and p38MAPK-activation is impaired in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). ET over 4 weeks partially corrects adiponectin-stimulated CAC migration and CXCR4 expression in patients with CAD (n=10). No change was observed in the control group (n=10). Adipo improves the migratory capacity of CACs in response to SDF1, partially through an upregulation of CXCR4. This is mediated through a pathway that involves binding of adipo to the AdipoR1 and subsequent PI3kinase/p38MAPK/ NF&#x3ba;b activation. In addition ET corrects the adiponectin responsiveness of CACs, and thereby might promote endogenous repair of damaged endothelium.",

    "abstract": "Insulin resistance (IR) is the major driving force behind development and progression of atherosclerosis in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Therefore, correction of IR is a relevant therapeutic target.We performed the current trial to evaluate whether 12- month metformin therapy improves vascular stiffness in patients with NAFLD and to assess if this improvement is associated with change in glucose control, insulin resistance or circulating adiponectin. In randomized, placebo controlled study, 63 patients with NAFLD were assigned to one of two groups: Group 1 received daily metformin; Group 2 received placebo. Central aortic augmentation index (AI) was performed using SphygmoCor (version 7.1, AtCor Medical, Sydney, Australia) at baseline, at 4-and 12-month treatment period. Metabolic parameters, insulin resistance markers and serum adiponectin levels were determined. In placebo group: AI did not improve during the treatment period. Liver function and adiponectin levels did not change during the study.In multiple linear regression analysis, the independent predictors of arterial stiffness improvement were metformin treatment and increase in circulating adiponectin levels.Among metformin treated patients: AI decreased significantly during the study. ALP and ALT decreased during initial 4-month treatment period, however raised to the pretreatment levels after 12&#x2009;months. Serum adiponectin level tended to increase during treatment period with metformin. Metformin treatment was associated with significant decrease in AI during one year treatment in NAFLD patients. These beneficial vascular effects was associated with exposure to metformin per se as well as change in adiponectin levels suggesting that metformin may mediate its vascular effects via glycemic control-independent mechanisms.",

In addition to the risk imposed by the disease itself, pharmacological treatment adds also a sizable risk, especially if certain classes of antidiabetic drugs are employed. Animal evidence indicates that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors have anti-atherosclerotic effects, yet clinical data are scarcely available. We plan to prospectively investigate the effects of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibition with vildagliptin on a number of atherothrombotic markers and adipokines in patients with proven atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes. The selected markers are: interleukin-6, high sensitivity C reactive protein, interleukin 1-beta, total adiponectin levels, matrix metallo-proteinase 9 and platelet reactivity testing. Sixty eligible patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to vildagliptin/metformin or metformin only treatment, for a 3-month duration treatment. Blood sampling for the proposed investigations will be taken at enrollment and immediately after completion of the study period. Demonstrating antiatherothrombotic properties of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors on proven markers is of substantial clinical significance. Coupled with their proven good safety profile these findings could translate into a significant clinical benefit.",

    "abstract": "Prenatal growth restraint, if followed by postnatal overweight, confers risk for adult disease including diabetes. The mechanisms whereby neonatal nutrition may modulate such risk are poorly understood. We studied the effects of nutrition (breast-feeding [BRF] vs. formula-feeding [FOF]) on weight partitioning and endocrine state (as judged by high-molecular-weight [HMW] adiponectin and IGF-I) of infants born small for gestational age (SGA). Body composition (by absorptiometry), HMW adiponectin, and IGF-I were assessed at birth and 4 months in BRF infants born appropriate for gestational age (AGA; n = 72) and SGA infants receiving BRF (n = 46) or FOF (n = 56), the latter being randomized to receive a standard (FOF1) or protein-rich formula (FOF2). Compared with AGA-BRF infants, the catchup growth of SGA infants was confined to lean mass, independently of nutrition. Compared with AGA-BRF infants, SGA-BRF infants had normal HMW adiponectin and IGF-I levels at 4 months, whereas SGA-FOF infants had elevated levels of HMW adiponectin (particularly SGA-FOF1) and IGF-I (particularly SGA-FOF2). In conclusion, neonatal nutrition seems to influence endocrinology more readily than body composition of SGA infants. Follow-up will disclose whether the endocrine abnormalities in SGA-FOF infants can serve as early markers of an unfavorable metabolic course and whether they may contribute to design early interventions that prevent subsequent disease, including diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have examined the associations between polymorphisms of adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), but those studies have been inconclusive. The aim of this study was to access the relationship between three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), +45&#x2009;T&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;G (rs2241766), +276&#x2009;G&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;T (rs1501299) and -11377&#x2009;C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;G (rs266729) in ADIPOQ and CVD. A comprehensive search was conducted to identify all studies on the association of ADIPOQ gene polymorphisms with CVD risk. The fixed and random effect pooled measures (i.e. odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI)) were calculated in the meta-analysis. Heterogeneity among studies was evaluated using Q test and the I2. Publication bias was estimated using modified Egger's linear regression test. Thirty-seven studies concerning the associations between the three polymorphisms of ADIPOQ gene and CVD risk were enrolled in this meta-analysis, including 6,398 cases and 10,829 controls for rs2241766, 8,392 cases and 18,730 controls for rs1501299 and 7,835 cases and 14,023 controls for rs266729. The three SNPs were significantly associated with CVD, yielding pooled ORs of 1.22 (95%CI: 1.07, 1.39; P = 0.004), 0.90 (95%CI: 0.83, 0.97; P = 0.007) and 1.09(95%CI: 1.01, 1.17; P = 0.032) for rs2241766, rs1501299 and rs266729, respectively. Rs2241766 and rs1501299 were significantly associated with coronary heart disease (CHD), yielding pooled ORs of 1.29 (95%CI: 1.09, 1.52; P = 0.004) and 0.89 (95%CI: 0.81, 0.99; P = 0.025), respectively. The pooled OR for rs266729 and CHD was 1.09 (95%CI: 0.99, 1.19; P = 0.090). Significant between-study heterogeneity was found in our meta-analysis. Evidence of publication bias was observed in the meta-analysis. The present meta-analysis showed that the associations between rs2241766, rs1501299 and rs266729 in the ADIPOQ and CVD were significant but weak. High quality studies are still needed to confirm the associations, especially for rs2241766.",

    "abstract": "To compare serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, interleukin 6 (IL-6), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), adiponectin, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), before and after 3 months treatment with metformin in obese adolescents with insulin resistance (IR). This was a randomized, double-blinded, clinical trial of two groups of obese adolescents with IR, aged 9-18 years: a placebo group (n=14) and a metformin group (n=12) who received 500 mg metformin every 12 h for 3 months. Anthropometric and biochemical (metabolic and inflammatory cytokines) assessments were compared at the beginning and end of treatment. After 3 months of treatment, body mass index (kg/m2) was reduced in both groups: placebo group (32.82 +/- 6.37-32.10 +/- 6.52; p=0.011) and metformin group (33.44 +/- 5.82-32.71 +/- 5.77; p=0.015). Serum fasting insulin concentrations (pmol/L) increased in the placebo group (189.45 +/- 112.64-266.06 +/- 167.79; p=0.01) and showed a slight decrease in the metformin group (256.82 +/- 113.89-229.25 +/- 86.53; p=0.64). Adiponectin concentrations (microg/mL) decreased in the placebo group (13.17 +/- 7.31-5.65 +/- 6.69; p=0.02), while these remained stable in the metformin group (8.57 +/- 3.98-7.86 +/- 6.23; p=0.64). In the metformin group, significant reductions were found in the variances of serum TNFalpha concentrations (p=0.006; Levene test). These results suggest that treating obese adolescents with IR using metformin for 3 months is an option for patients without response to traditional lifestyle change because metformin improves inflammatory activity, which is an etiological factor in cardiovascular disease development.",

    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation is associated with inflammation. In contrast to inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen produced in the liver, YKL-40 is produced at the site of inflammation including in the myocardium. We hypothesized that elevated plasma YKL-40 levels associate with increased risk of atrial fibrillation. We measured plasma YKL-40 in 8731 participants from the prospective Copenhagen City Heart Study including 896 individuals who developed atrial fibrillation during up to 18 years of follow-up. Additionally, we measured YKL-40 in 6621 individuals from the cross-sectional Copenhagen General Population Study including 337 cases with atrial fibrillation. A YKL-40 level &gt;95% percentile (&gt;204 &#x3bc;g/L) versus &lt;25% percentile (&lt;36 &#x3bc;g/L) associated prospectively with a 2.10-fold (95%CI:1.43-3.09) increased risk of atrial fibrillation. Hazard ratios attenuated slightly after multifactorial adjustment to 2.01 (1.35-2.98), and further after additional adjustment for heart failure to 1.89 (1.27-2.80), for plasma CRP to 1.79 (1.20-2.67), and for fibrinogen levels to 1.89 (1.27-2.81). Adjusting multifactorially including both heart failure, CRP, and fibrinogen attenuated the risk of atrial fibrillation to 1.79 (1.20-2.67). These findings were supported in the cross-sectional study with an odds ratio of 2.73 (1.46-5.11) for a YKL-40 level &gt;95% percentile versus &lt;25% percentile, attenuating to an odds ratio of 2.13 (1.09-4.18) when adjusting multifactorially including heart failure, CRP, and fibrinogen. Elevated plasma YKL-40 levels robustly associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation originating from hospital admissions or visits to the emergency department, independent of heart failure, and CRP and fibrinogen levels. These findings need to be confirmed in other independent studies.",

    "abstract": "The relation between plasma leptin and daily ad libitum roughage intake was evaluated during a 14-day period in eight obese Shetland ponies. When the feeding strategy was changed from maintenance feeding to ad libitum feeding, feed intake increased the first day, decreased the second day and increased again during the following days to reach a constant level after 8 days. Plasma leptin concentration increased during the first 2 days, but remained constant afterwards. Although the same pattern was found in all ponies, the magnitude of the increase in leptin on day 1 and the resulting decrease in feed intake on day 2 differed between ponies. A lower anorectic effect was seen in ponies with higher initial leptin concentration, suggesting the presence of different degrees in leptin sensitivity in obese ponies. High leptin production in a attempt to compensate for the decrease in leptin sensitivity might explain large variations in plasma leptin among obese ponies with similar body condition score. Further research is necessary to clarify whether the reduced leptin sensitivity precedes obesity in equines or vice versa.",

    "abstract": "Circulating levels of adiponectin, a hormone produced predominantly by adipocytes, are highly heritable and are inversely associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and other metabolic traits. We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies in 39,883 individuals of European ancestry to identify genes associated with metabolic disease. We identified 8 novel loci associated with adiponectin levels and confirmed 2 previously reported loci (P&#x200a;=&#x200a;4.5&#xd7;10(-8)-1.2&#xd7;10(-43)). Using a novel method to combine data across ethnicities (N&#x200a;=&#x200a;4,232 African Americans, N&#x200a;=&#x200a;1,776 Asians, and N&#x200a;=&#x200a;29,347 Europeans), we identified two additional novel loci. Expression analyses of 436 human adipocyte samples revealed that mRNA levels of 18 genes at candidate regions were associated with adiponectin concentrations after accounting for multiple testing (p&lt;3&#xd7;10(-4)). We next developed a multi-SNP genotypic risk score to test the association of adiponectin decreasing risk alleles on metabolic traits and diseases using consortia-level meta-analytic data. This risk score was associated with increased risk of T2D (p&#x200a;=&#x200a;4.3&#xd7;10(-3), n&#x200a;=&#x200a;22,044), increased triglycerides (p&#x200a;=&#x200a;2.6&#xd7;10(-14), n&#x200a;=&#x200a;93,440), increased waist-to-hip ratio (p&#x200a;=&#x200a;1.8&#xd7;10(-5), n&#x200a;=&#x200a;77,167), increased glucose two hours post oral glucose tolerance testing (p&#x200a;=&#x200a;4.4&#xd7;10(-3), n&#x200a;=&#x200a;15,234), increased fasting insulin (p&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.015, n&#x200a;=&#x200a;48,238), but with lower in HDL-cholesterol concentrations (p&#x200a;=&#x200a;4.5&#xd7;10(-13), n&#x200a;=&#x200a;96,748) and decreased BMI (p&#x200a;=&#x200a;1.4&#xd7;10(-4), n&#x200a;=&#x200a;121,335). These findings identify novel genetic determinants of adiponectin levels, which, taken together, influence risk of T2D and markers of insulin resistance.",

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a slow, chronic disease characterized by the focal deterioration and abrasion of articular cartilage. Leptin may play an important role in the pathophysiology of OA. Exercise and glucosamine sulfate therapy is one of the most commonly used in patients with knee OA. The goals of the present study are performed to investigate whether 12-week strength training program and glucosamine sulfate have an effect on serum leptin levels in knee OA and the relationship between leptin, clinical parameters, and radiographic severity of knee OA. Thirty-seven women with the diagnosis of knee OA were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomized into two groups. Group I (n = 19) received an exercise program, while group II (n = 18) received glucosamine sulfate (1,500 mg/day) in addition to the exercise therapy. Both groups were treated for 12 weeks. Leptin level was assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks. The concentration of leptin was measured by ELISA. The patients were evaluated regarding pain, disability, functional performance, and muscle strength. Both groups showed significant improvements in leptin levels, pain, disability, muscle strength, and functional performance with no statistically significant difference between the groups after the therapy. At basal time, plasma leptin levels were significantly correlated with body mass index and duration of disease, but no significant correlation was found with patient age, pain, disability, functional performance, muscle strength, and radiographic severity of knee OA. The results of this preliminary study revealed that exercise alone was adequate to prevent structural changes relieving the symptoms of OA. We also found that exercise alone could affect serum plasma levels of the leptin, important mediators of cartilage metabolism. Decreases in serum leptin may be one mechanism by which cartilage metabolism affects physical function and symptoms in OA patients.",

    "title": "A one-year school-based diet/exercise intervention improves non-traditional disease biomarkers in Mexican-American children.",
    "abstract": "School-based interventions are an effective way to treat childhood obesity. The purpose of the present study was to biologically validate an established school-based intervention designed to reduce standardised body mass index (zBMI) over a period of 12 months. This intervention focused on a subset of Mexican-American children who were participating in a larger clinical weight loss study. Plasma samples were analysed from self-identified Mexican-American children (12-14 years) who were randomised to either a school-based intervention (IN, n = 152) or self-help control (CN, n = 69). Treatment was 4 days week&#x207b;&#xb9; of exercise (45 min day&#x207b;&#xb9;) and 1 day week&#x207b;&#xb9; of nutritional counselling for 6 months. Fasting (&gt;8 h) blood samples were collected at baseline, 6 months (end of active intervention) and 12 months (6 months after the end of the active intervention). Plasma resistin, adiponectin and leptin concentration were measured using a multiplex assay. Separate linear mixed models and a P &lt; 0.05 were used to test for significance. Significant group &#xd7; time interactions were found for resistin (P &lt; 0.0001), adiponectin (P = 0.001) and leptin (P = 0.013). For resistin, IN was 12% lower at 6 months than CN. Adiponectin concentration in IN was greater at 6 months (26%) and 12 months (8%) than CN. Leptin concentration was 22% lower for IN at 12 months than CN. We have previously reported that our school-based intervention reduced zBMI and now reported alterations in biologically relevant disease biomarkers. Some of the observed changes were only present at the end of the active intervention (resistin), while others persisted until 12 months (leptin and adiponectin). These changes underscore the effectiveness of our school-based intervention at not only improving zBMI but also at reducing disease risk.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of valsartan on abnormal adipocyte metabolism and prothrombotic state in hypertensive patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS). We conducted a multicenter, prospective, randomized, parallel-group controlled trial in 150 hypertensive patients with MetS. They were randomly assigned to receive either 80-160 mg valsartan per day (valsartan group, n=79) or other conventional treatment without a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor (non-RAS inhibitor group, n=71). After 1 year, there were no significant differences between the 2 groups in the changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressures (valsartan: 153&#xb1;15/86&#xb1;15 to 138&#xb1;16/77&#xb1;12 mmHg; non-RAS inhibitor: 150&#xb1;14/82&#xb1;15 to 137&#xb1;15/76&#xb1;10 mmHg).

These data suggest that elevated liver fat is most closely associated with elevated serum IL-8 and NGF levels as well as increased AIR and HOMA-IR. These elevated factors may play significant roles in the metabolic abnormalities associated with elevated liver fat in obese Hispanics.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of treatment with the antioxidant &#x3b1;-lipoic acid (ALA) with or without vitamin E supplementation, on markers of insulin resistance and systemic inflammation and plasma nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations in individuals with the metabolic syndrome. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, subjects with the metabolic syndrome received ALA (600 mg/day, n = 34), vitamin E (100 IU/day, n = 36), both ALA and vitamin E (n = 41), or matching placebo (n = 40) for 1 year. Fasting circulating concentrations of glucose and insulin were measure every 3 months and NEFA, markers of inflammation, adiponectin and vitamin E were measured at 6 monthly intervals. Plasma NEFA concentrations decreased [-10 (-18, 0)%] at a marginal level of significance (p = 0.05) in those who received ALA alone compared with placebo and decreased [-8 (-14, -1)% (95% CI)] significantly (P = 0.02) in participants who were randomised to ALA with and without vitamin E compared with those who did not receive ALA. Fasting glucose, insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, adiponectin, and markers of inflammation did not change significantly during the study. These data suggest that prolonged treatment with ALA may modestly reduce plasma NEFA concentrations but does not alter insulin or glucose levels in individuals with the metabolic syndrome.",

Here, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the contribution of five candidate genes to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes in the Chinese Han population. We searched for relevant published papers and used STATA v.11.0 to perform a meta-analysis on six single-nucleotide polymorphisms in five genes-ADIPOQ-rs2241766 (SNP45) and -rs1501299 (SNP276), ADRB3-rs4994 (Trp64Arg), CAPN10-rs3792267 (SNP43), ENPP1-rs1044498 (K121Q), and PPARGC1A-rs8192678 (Gly482Ser)-in the Chinese Han population under an additive genetic model. The pooled odds ratios (95% confidence intervals and P-values) were 0.71 (0.60-0.83; P &lt; 0.001) for ADIPOQ-rs2241766, 0.79 (0.64-0.97; P = 0.027) for ADIPOQ-rs1501299, 1.27 (1.07-1.51; P = 0.006) for ADRB3-rs4994, 0.79 (0.57-1.10; P = 0.163) for CAPN10-rs3792267, 1.41 (1.13-1.76; P = 0.003) for ENPP1-rs1044498, and 1.54 (1.34-1.81; P &lt; 0.001) for PPARGC1A-rs8192678.

    "abstract": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the most common cardiovascular diseases and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Various researchers have investigated the role of ADIPOQ gene in the risk of CAD, yet their results have been inconsistent. To evaluate the association between ADIPOQ genetic polymorphisms and CAD risk, relevant studies published before October 2011 were identified by searching PubMed and EMBASE. Studies were selected using previously defined criteria. The strength of the relationship between the four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the ADIPOQ gene and CAD risk was assessed using odds ratios (ORs). A total of 12 465 subjects from 17 case-control studies were identified in the present study. Based on the relevant studies, it was determined that the risk of CAD was not associated with rs2241766 in any genetic model. Increased risk of CAD was associated with rs266729 in allele contrast (1.11, [1.03, 1.20]) and dominant genetic model (1.15, 95%CI: [1.05, 1.27]); increased risk of CAD was also associated with rs822395 in additive (1.63, 95%CI: [1.19, 2.22]) and recessive genetic model (1.71, 95%CI: [1.27, 2.30]). It was further determined that the rs1501299 polymorphism reduced the risk of CAD in the additive (0.80, 95%CI: [0.67, 0.94]) and recessive genetic model (0.81, 95%CI: [0.68, 0.95]). In the stratified analysis, significant associations were found in Asian subjects for rs266729 and in Caucasian subjects for rs1501299. There is an association between ADIPOQ gene polymorphisms and CAD risk. Different SNPs of the ADIPOQ gene have different associations with CAD risk, and appear to increase risk in individuals of Asian ethnicity while decrease the CAD risk in Caucasians. However, the overall strength of association was mild to moderate.",

Forty post-puberty obese adolescents were randomly assigned into two groups: (1) NAFLD group and (2) non-NAFLD group (diagnosis by ultrasonography) and submitted to a weight loss therapy. Body composition was analyzed by air displacement plethysmography, bone mineral density (BMD) and content by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, blood samples were collected to measure lipid profile, hepatic enzymes, and adipokines. Leptin and adiponectin concentrations were measured by ELISA. A decrease in total body mass, BMI, body fat, visceral and subcutaneous fat, insulin concentration, HOMA-IR, total cholesterol and an increase in lean body mass were observed in both groups after therapy.

    "title": "Restoration of adipose function in obese glucose-tolerant men following pioglitazone treatment is associated with CCAAT enhancer-binding protein &#x3b2; up-regulation.",
    "abstract": "Obese AT (adipose tissue) exhibits increased macrophage number. Pro-inflammatory CD16+ peripheral monocyte numbers are also reported to increase with obesity. The present study was undertaken to simultaneously investigate obesity-associated changes in CD16+ monocytes and ATMs (AT macrophages). In addition, a pilot randomized placebo controlled trial using the PPAR (peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor) agonists, pioglitazone and fenofibrate was performed to determine their effects on CD14+/CD16+ monocytes, ATM and cardiometabolic and adipose dysfunction indices. Obese glucose-tolerant men (n=28) were randomized to placebo, pioglitazone (30&#xa0;mg/day) and fenofibrate (160&#xa0;mg/day) for 12&#xa0;weeks. A blood sample was taken to assess levels of serum inflammatory markers and circulating CD14+/CD16+ monocyte levels via flow cytometry. A subcutaneous AT biopsy was performed to determine adipocyte cell surface and ATM number, the latter was determined via assessment of CD68 expression by IHC (immunohistochemistry) and real-time PCR. Subcutaneous AT mRNA expression of CEBP&#x3b2; (CCAAT enhancer-binding protein &#x3b2;), SREBP1c (sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein 1c), PPAR&#x3b3;2, IRS-1 (insulin receptor substrate-1), GLUT4 (glucose transporter type&#xa0;4) and TNF&#x3b1; (tumour necrosis factor &#x3b1;) were also assessed. Comparisons were made between obese and lean controls (n=16) at baseline, and pre- and post-PPAR agonist treatment. Obese individuals had significantly increased adipocyte cell surface, percentage CD14+/CD16+ monocyte numbers and ATM number (all P=0.0001). Additionally, serum TNF-&#x3b1; levels were significantly elevated (P=0.017) and adiponectin levels reduced (total: P=0.0001; high: P=0.022) with obesity. ATM number and percentage of CD14+/CD16+ monocytes correlated significantly (P=0.05). Pioglitazone improved adiponectin levels significantly (P=0.0001), and resulted in the further significant enlargement of adipocytes (P=0.05), without effect on the percentage CD14+/CD16+ or ATM number. Pioglitazone treatment also significantly increased subcutaneous AT expression of CEBP&#x3b2; mRNA. The finding that improvements in obesity-associated insulin resistance following pioglitazone were associated with increased adipocyte cell surface and systemic adiponectin levels, supports the centrality of AT to the cardiometabolic derangement underlying the development of T2D (Type 2 diabetes) and CVD (cardiovascular disease).",

    "abstract": "Adipose-tissue derivatives, known as adipokines, have been involved in the inflammatory-mediated metabolic and cardiovascular disorders of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study examined the association between novel adipokines and self-reported physical activity, a potential anti-inflammatory mediator. We enrolled 247 men and women with T2DM, free from overt cardiovascular disease. Based on a physical activity questionnaire, patients were classified into groups: A) sedentary, who did not report any physical activity or reported light activities&lt;2 h/week and B) active, referring to low or moderate-intensity physical activities&gt;2 h/week. Among them, 88 patients were randomly selected to perform a cardiorespiratory ergocycle testing. Clinical parameters, glycemic and lipid profiles, HOMA-IR, and serum levels of visfatin, apelin, vaspin, ghrelin and adiponectin were assessed. With the exception of fat-mass, our groups did not differ in anthropometric parameters and pharmaceutical regimen. Active patients showed ameliorated glucose regulation, HOMA-IR, hsCRP and exercise capacity compared to sedentary counterparts (p&lt;0.01). Active rather than sedentary patients showed lower visfatin (10.16&#xb1;5.53 ng/ml vs 14.77&#xb1;8.48 ng/ml, p=0.013), higher apelin (1.39&#xb1;0.65 ng/ml vs 1.04&#xb1;0.35 ng/ml, p=0.018) and adiponectin (11.82&#xb1;3.06 &#x3bc;g/ml vs 7.81&#xb1;2.11 &#x3bc;g/ml, p=0.033) levels. There were non-significant differences in the rest of parameters between groups. After adjusting for age, sex and BMI, physical activity along with hsCRP and ghrelin remained independent determinants of visfatin levels (R(2)=0.328, p=0.032), while physical activity was independently associated with apelin (R(2)=0.221, p=0.022). Self-controlled physical activity of, even, moderate intensity ameliorates adipokines, such as visfatin, apelin and adiponectin, in patients with T2DM. Prospective interventional studies will confirm our results. The ClinicalTrials.gov identifier is: NCT00306176.",

    "abstract": "Many studies have suggested that adiponectin gene might be involved in the development of coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the results have been inconsistent. In this study, the authors performed a meta-analysis to assess the associations of +45T/G, +276G/T and -11377C/G polymorphisms in adiponectin gene with CAD susceptibility. Published literature from PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched. Pooled odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using fixed- or random-effects model. Sixteen studies (4394 cases / 8187 controls) for +45T/G polymorphism, fifteen studies (3569 cases / 7463 controls) for +276G/T polymorphism, and thirteen studies (3531 cases / 7072 controls) for -11377C/G polymorphism were included in the meta-analysis. The overall results showed that there was a statistically significant association between -11377C/G polymorphism and CAD (G vs. C: OR=1.15, 95%CI 1.07-1.24).Similar results were observed among European (G vs. C: OR=1.11, 95%CI 1.02-1.20) and East Asian populations (G vs. C: OR=1.27, 95%CI 1.11-1.45). However, no significant association was found for +45T/G or +276G/T polymorphism with CAD susceptibility. The meta-analysis indicated the significant association of -11377C/G polymorphism, but not +45T/G or +276G/T polymorphism, with CAD susceptibility. However, large-scale studies with the consideration of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions should be conducted to investigate the associations in future.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, whereas long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) from fish may have cardioprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. This study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that acute and short-term supplementation with a low dose of marine n-3 PUFA exerts an anti-inflammatory effect in overweight subjects. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 2 parallel groups, 50 overweight subjects were randomized to receive daily supplementation with 2 capsules containing either 2 g of fish oil (1.1 g marine n-3 PUFA) or 2 g of olive oil. Blood samples and adipose tissue biopsies were collected at baseline, after 1 day (acute effect), and after 6 weeks (short-term effect) of supplementation. No significant effects were seen after supplementation for 1 day, but after 6 weeks, subjects receiving fish oil had a significant increase in the n-3 PUFA content of granulocytes and adipose tissue (P &lt; .01). Serum adiponectin levels were increased by 0.55 &#x3bc;g/mL (95% confidence interval, 0.02-1.08) in the fish oil group compared with the control group (P = .04) after 6 weeks of supplementation. Levels of interleukin 6 were inversely correlated to the marine n-3 PUFA content of granulocytes and adipose tissue at baseline (excluding &#x3b1;-linolenic acid). In conclusion, daily supplementation with 1.1 g of marine n-3 PUFA significantly increased serum adiponectin, but the effect was small, and no overall anti-inflammatory effect of the supplement could be demonstrated.",

The aim of this study was to investigate possible associations between 45T/G and 276G/T variants of the ADIPOQ gene and susceptibility to PCOS. A meta-analysis of 11 published case-control studies on the 45T/G variant of the ADIPOQ gene (involving a total of 1176 patients with PCOS and 1759 controls) and eight published case-control studies on the 276G/T variant of the ADIPOQ gene (involving a total of 895 patients with PCOS and 1024 controls) was performed. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of associations. The comparison of G vs. T in ADIPOQ 45T/G showed significant differential susceptibility to PCOS (OR=1.397, 95% CI 1.156-1.689). A significant association was also found between PCOS susceptibility and the comparison of G vs. T in ADIPOQ 276G/T (OR 0.812, 95% CI 0.704-0.937). However, protective effects were found in both sites under the co-dominant model for Caucasians.

    "title": "Dietary inclusion of salmon, herring and pompano as oily fish reduces CVD risk markers in dyslipidaemic middle-aged and elderly Chinese women.",
    "abstract": "Dietary intervention studies to assess the cardioprotective effects of oily fish are scarce in China. The present study aimed to examine the effects of the oily fish, Norwegian salmon, herring and local farmed pompano (Trachinotus ovatus) on CVD risk markers when included in the Chinese diet. In this 8-week, parallel-arm, randomised intervention study, 126 Chinese women with hypertriacylglycerolaemia, aged 35-70 years, were assigned to four groups to consume an experimental lunch containing 80 g fillets of either one of three oily fish or a mix of commonly eaten meats (pork/chicken/beef/lean fish) for 5 d/week. The results showed that inclusion of the three oily fish significantly increased the intake of n-3 long-chain PUFA (LC-PUFA) while decreasing the dietary n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio. Compared to the control group, significant increases of DHA, EPA+DHA and total n-3 PUFA in plasma choline phosphoglyceride were observed in the three oily fish groups. Plasma TAG levels were significantly reduced only in the salmon and herring groups. When compared to the baseline level, the three oily fish diets significantly decreased serum concentrations of TAG, apoB, apoCII and apoCIII, but only the salmon and herring diets significantly lowered TNF-&#x3b1; and raised adiponectin levels in serum. The salmon diet additionally decreased the serum concentration of IL-6. To conclude, dietary inclusion of salmon, herring and pompano as oily fish can effectively increase serum n-3 LC-PUFA content and are associated with favourable biochemical changes in dyslipidaemic middle-aged and elderly Chinese women, and these beneficial effects are mainly associated with n-3 LC-PUFA contents.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the present secondary analysis study was to investigate the ability of the body adiposity index (BAI) to detect changes in % body fat levels before and after a weight loss intervention when compared to % body fat levels measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and to examine the relationship between the BAI with cardiometabolic risk factors. The study population for this secondary analysis included 132 non-diabetic obese sedentary postmenopausal women (age: 57.2 &#xb1; 4.7 years, BMI: 35.0 &#xb1; 3.7 kg/m(2)) participating in a weight loss intervention that consisted of a calorie-restricted diet with or without resistance training. We measured: (1) visceral fat using CT-scan, (2) body composition using DXA, (3) hip circumference and height from which the BAI was calculated, and (4) cardiometabolic risk factors such as insulin sensitivity (using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp), blood pressure as well as fasting plasma lipids, hsC-reactive protein (CRP), leptin, and glucose. Percent body fat levels for both methods significantly decreased after the weight loss intervention. In addition, the percent change in % body fat levels after the weight loss intervention was significantly different between % body fat measured using the DXA and the BAI (-4.5 &#xb1; 6.6 vs. -5.8 &#xb1; 5.9%; p = 0.03, respectively). However, we observed a good overall agreement between the two methods, as shown by the Bland-Altman analysis, for percent change in % body fat. Furthermore, similar correlations were observed between both measures of % body fat with cardiometabolic risk factors. However, results from the multiple linear regression analysis showed that % body fat using the BAI appeared to predict cardiometabolic risk factors differently than % body fat using the DXA in our cohort. Estimating % body fat using the BAI seems to accurately trace variations of % body fat after weight loss. However, this index showed differences in predicting cardiometabolic risk factors when compared to % body fat measured using DXA.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological and clinical studies suggest that low-glycemic index diets could protect against weight gain. However, the relationship between these diets and adipokines or inflammatory markers is unclear. In the present study we examine how the dietary glycemic index (GI) and dietary glycemic load (GL) are associated with several adipokines and related metabolic risk markers of obesity and diabetes in a cross-sectional and longitudinal manner. 511 elderly community-dwelling men and women at high cardiovascular risk were recruited for the PREDIMED trial. Dietary data were collected at baseline and after 1 year of follow-up. The GI and GL were calculated. Plasma leptin, adiponectin and other metabolic risk markers were measured at baseline and after 1 year. At baseline, subjects in the highest quartiles of GI showed significantly higher levels of TNF and IL-6 than those in the lowest quartiles. Dietary GI index was negatively related to plasma leptin and adiponectin levels. After 1 year of follow-up, subjects with a higher increase in dietary GI or GL showed a greater reduction in leptin and adiponectin plasma levels. There was no association between GI or GL and the other metabolic markers measured. Our results suggest that the consumption of high-GI or high-GL diets may modulate plasma concentrations of leptin and adiponectin, both adipostatic molecules implicated in energy balance and cardiometabolic risk.",

    "abstract": "Adipokines are linked to obesity and insulin sensitivity and have recently been related to breast cancer risk and prognosis. We investigated the associations of plasma leptin and adiponectin with mammographic density and disease status and assessed their prognostic effect on recurrence-free survival in premenopausal women at risk for breast cancer. We measured circulating lipids, insulin-like growth factor 1, glucose, insulin and insulin sensitivity (calculated by homeostasis model assessment [HOMA] index), leptin, adiponectin, and leptin-to-adiponectin ratio in 235 premenopausal women with pT1mic/pT1a breast cancer (n = 21), intraepithelial neoplasia (n = 160), or 5-year Gail risk of 1.3% or greater (n = 54) who participated in a 2 &#xd7; 2 trial of low-dose tamoxifen, fenretinide, both agents, or placebo over a 2-year period. At baseline, adiponectin levels were directly associated with mammographic density and HDL cholesterol and negatively associated with leptin, leptin-to-adiponectin ratio, body mass index (BMI), and HOMA index. Median adiponectin levels were lower in affected than in unaffected women (P = .006). After a median of 7.2 years and total of 57 breast neoplastic events, there was a 12% reduction in the risk of breast neoplastic events per unit increase of adiponectin (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.81 to 0.96; P = .03). There was no interaction between treatment and adiponectin levels. Low adiponectin levels are associated with a history of prior intraepithelial neoplasia or pT1mic/pT1a breast cancer and higher risk of second breast neoplastic events in premenopausal women. The associations are independent of BMI, mammographic density, and treatment. Our findings support the role of adiponectin as a potential target for premenopausal breast cancer prevention and treatment.",

    "title": "Moderate alcohol consumption alters both leucocyte gene expression profiles and circulating proteins related to immune response and lipid metabolism in men.",
    "abstract": "Moderate alcohol consumption has various effects on immune and inflammatory processes, which could accumulatively modulate chronic disease risk. So far, no comprehensive, integrative profiling has been performed to investigate the effects of longer-term alcohol consumption. Therefore, we studied the effects of alcohol consumption on gene expression patterns using large-scale profiling of whole-genome transcriptomics in blood cells and on a number of proteins in blood. In a randomised, open-label, cross-over trial, twenty-four young, normal-weight men consumed 100 ml vodka (30 g alcohol) with 200 ml orange juice or only orange juice daily during dinner for 4 weeks. After each period, blood was sampled for measuring gene expression and selected proteins. Pathway analysis of 345 down-regulated and 455 up-regulated genes revealed effects of alcohol consumption on various signalling responses, immune processes and lipid metabolism. Among the signalling processes, the most prominently changed was glucocorticoid receptor signalling. A network on immune response showed a down-regulated NF-&#x3ba;B gene expression together with increased plasma adiponectin and decreased pro-inflammatory IL-1 receptor antagonist and IL-18, and acute-phase proteins ferritin and &#x3b1;1-antitrypsin concentrations (all P &lt; 0.05) after alcohol consumption. Furthermore, a network of gene expression changes related to lipid metabolism was observed, with a central role for PPAR&#x3b1; which was supported by increased HDL-cholesterol and several apo concentrations (all P &lt; 0.05) after alcohol consumption. In conclusion, an integrated approach of profiling both genes and proteins in blood showed that 4 weeks of moderate alcohol consumption altered immune responses and lipid metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Excess visceral adipose tissue predicts for incipient diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Human data are mixed regarding the benefits of selective visceral adipose tissue reduction. We investigated the effects of omentectomy added to laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass on glucose homeostasis and lipids, inflammatory markers, and adipokines 90 days postoperatively in nondiabetic patients at the Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital and Oregon Health and Science University (Portland, OR). A single-blind, randomized study of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass plus omentectomy versus laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass alone in 28 subjects (7 men and 21 women). The groups were matched at baseline for gender, age, and body mass index (BMI). The eligibility criteria included age &#x2265;18 years, BMI &#x2265;40 and &lt;50 kg/m(2) without co-morbid conditions or BMI &#x2265;35 and &lt;50 kg/m(2) with co-morbid conditions. The primary outcome measures were changes in the fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and homostatic model assessment of insulin resistance. The secondary measures were BMI and the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1;, interleukin, total and high-molecular-weight adiponectin, fibrinogen, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels. After surgery, the BMI decreased significantly in both groups and was not different at the follow-up point. Although many outcome parameters improved with weight loss in both groups postoperatively, only the omentectomy group experienced statistically significant decreases in fasting glucose (P &lt; .05), total (P = .004) and very-low-density lipoprotein (P = .001) cholesterol, and an increase in the high-molecular-weight/total adiponectin ratio (P = .013). Omentectomy added to laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass results in favorable changes in glucose homeostasis, lipid levels, and adipokine profile at 90 days postoperatively. These data support the hypothesis that selective ablation of visceral adipose tissue conveys metabolic benefits in nondiabetic humans.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to explore the association of a functional YKL-40 promoter polymorphism (rs4950928) with baseline disease stage, response to antiviral therapy and risk of liver disease progression in a group of patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). YKL-40 promoter polymorphisms were determined in 456 Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-term Treatment against Cirrhosis (HALT-C) Trial patients with bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis entering a prerandomization lead-in peginterferon/ribavirin 24-week treatment phase and in 462 patients followed for a mean of 3.8 years after randomization to maintenance peginterferon or observation. Mean patient age was 49.5 years, 70.4% were men and 71.2% were Caucasian. The 17% frequency of the YKL-40 minor allele (T) was similar to that reported in the general population. YKL-40 genotype was associated significantly with baseline serum YKL-40 levels but was not associated with the likelihood of a virological response following 24-48 weeks of peginterferon/ribavirin therapy. Serum YKL-40 levels remained significantly lower during follow-up in the randomized TT homozygotes compared with CT heterozygotes and CC homozygotes (P &lt; 0.001). Despite this association, YKL-40 genotype was not associated with the risk of clinical or histological liver disease progression. A reduced frequency of the protective YKL-40 promoter polymorphism was not observed in the HALT-C Trial patient population. The absence of an association between YKL-40 promoter polymorphisms and baseline liver disease severity as well as with the risk of liver disease progression over time suggests that this polymorphism is not associated with disease progression in CHC patients with established fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Regular and continuous yoga exercise is one of the most important nonpharmacological methods of improving serum lipid concentrations, adipose tissue, and metabolic syndrome factors. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of yoga exercise on serum adiponectin and metabolic syndrome factors in obese postmenopausal Korean women. Sixteen healthy postmenopausal women aged 54.50 &#xb1; 2.75 years with more than 36% body fat were randomly assigned to either a yoga exercise group (n = 8) or to a no exercise control group (n = 8). The variables of body composition, visceral fat, serum adiponectin, and metabolic syndrome factors were measured in all the participants before and after the 16-week study. Body weight, percentage of body fat, lean body mass, body mass index, waist circumference, and visceral fat area had significantly decreased. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol and adiponectin had significantly increased, but total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood pressure, insulin, glucose, and homoeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance had significantly decreased. Serum adiponectin concentrations were significantly correlated with waist circumference, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, diastolic blood pressure, and homoeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance in the postyoga exercise group. Our findings indicate that yoga exercise improves adiponectin level, serum lipids, and metabolic syndrome risk factors in obese postmenopausal women. Consequently, yoga exercise will be effective in preventing cardiovascular disease caused by obesity in obese postmenopausal Korean women.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the effects of exenatide on BMI (primary endpoint) and cardiometabolic risk factors in nondiabetic youth with extreme obesity. Twelve children and adolescents (age 9-16 years old) with extreme obesity (BMI &#x2265;1.2 times the 95th percentile or BMI &#x2265;35 kg/m(2)) were enrolled in a 6-month, randomized, open-label, crossover, clinical trial consisting of two, 3-month phases: (i) a control phase of lifestyle modification and (ii) a drug phase of lifestyle modification plus exenatide. Participants were equally randomized to phase-order (i.e., starting with control or drug therapy) then crossed-over to the other treatment. BMI, body fat percentage, blood pressure, lipids, oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT), adipokines, plasma biomarkers of endothelial activation, and endothelial function were assessed at baseline, 3-, and 6-months. The mean change over each 3-month phase was compared between treatments. Compared to control, exenatide significantly reduced BMI (-1.7 kg/m(2), 95% confidence interval (CI) (-3.0, -0.4), P = 0.01), body weight (-3.9 kg, 95% CI (-7.11, -0.69), P = 0.02), and fasting insulin (-7.5 mU/l, 95% CI (-13.71, -1.37), P = 0.02). Significant improvements were observed for OGTT-derived insulin sensitivity (P = 0.02) and &#x3b2;-cell function (P = 0.03). Compliance with the injection regimen was excellent (&#x2265;94%) and exenatide was generally well-tolerated (the most common adverse event was mild nausea in 36%). These preliminary data suggest that exenatide should be evaluated in larger, well-controlled trials for its ability to reduce BMI and improve cardiometabolic risk factors in youth with extreme obesity.",

It remains to be elucidated how soon after initiation of walnut consumption beneficial effects on lipid profile and biomarkers of inflammation or vascular injury can be observed. Fifteen obese subjects (9 men and 6 women; age, 58 &#xb1; 2.5 years; body mass index, 36.6 &#xb1; 1.7 kg/m(2)) with the metabolic syndrome participated as inpatients in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover study involving short-term placebo or walnut-enriched diet (48 g/d for 4 days). Apolipoproteins and markers of inflammation and vascular injury were measured before and after consumption of the experimental diets. Consumption of walnuts was associated with a statistically significant increase in serum apolipoprotein A concentrations (P = .03), but did not affect circulating levels of fetuin A, resistin, C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, soluble intercellular adhesion molecules 1 and 3, soluble vascular cell adhesion protein 1, interleukins 6 and 8, tumor necrosis factor &#x3b1;, E-selectin, P-selectin, and thrombomodulin. Four days of walnut consumption (48 g/d) leads to mild increases in apolipoprotein A concentrations, changes that may precede and lead to the beneficial effects of walnuts on lipid profile in obese subjects with the metabolic syndrome.",

    "title": "Pioglitazone-mediated changes in lipoprotein particle composition are predicted by changes in adiponectin level in type 2 diabetes.",
    "abstract": "In animal and observational studies, adiponectin is associated with lipoprotein risk factors for cardiovascular disease. We analyzed data from a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the relationship between changes in adiponectin to changes in lipoprotein risk factors after an intervention that alters adiponectin levels. Adiponectin levels were measured at baseline and follow-up, as were lipoprotein risk factors for cardiovascular disease, at academic medical centers and ambulatory care centers. Participants included 361 men and women with type 2 diabetes. Intervention included randomization to treatment with glimepiride or pioglitazone for 72 wk. The relationship of treatment-related differences in adiponectin level to treatment-related differences in lipoprotein cardiovascular risk factors at 72 wk was evaluated. Pioglitazone led to an increase in adiponectin compared with glimepiride. Compared with baseline, pioglitazone treatment at 72 wk led to an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particle size and a decrease in very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particle size and LDL particle number. Glimepiride treatment more modestly decreased LDL particle number and increased LDL particle size. At 72 wk, there were significant treatment group differences for HDL, LDL, and VLDL particle size, and triglyceride and HDL cholesterol level. The increase in adiponectin predicted treatment-related improvement for triglyceride and HDL cholesterol level and LDL and HDL particle size. Increased adiponectin contributed to treatment-related benefit in lipoprotein cardiovascular disease risk factors in obese diabetic subjects treated with pioglitazone. These results provide support for a model that mechanistically links changes in adiponectin level to changes in lipoprotein composition in humans.",

    "abstract": "Although peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a widely accepted form of renal replacement therapy, concerns remain regarding the bioincompatible nature of standard PD fluid (PDF). Short-term studies of new biocompatible PDFs low in glucose degradation products (GDPs) reveal divergent results with respect to peritoneal integrity. We studied 125 patients on maintenance PD who were assigned, by simple randomization, to receive either conventional or low-GDP PDF at PD initiation. Parameters of dialysis adequacy and peritoneal transport of small solutes were determined at initiation and after a period of maintenance PD at the time when serum and overnight effluent dialysate were simultaneously collected and assayed for various cytokines, chemokines, adipokines, and cardiac biomarkers. All patients were further followed prospectively for an average of 15 months from the day of serum and effluent collection to determine patient survival and cardiovascular events. Patients treated with conventional or low-GDP PDF were matched for sex, age, duration of dialysis, dialysis adequacy, and incidence of cardiovascular disease or diabetes. After an average of 2.3 years of PD treatment, the weekly total and peritoneal creatinine clearance, and the total and peritoneal Kt/V were comparable in the groups. However, urine output was higher in patients using low-GDP PDF despite there having been no difference between the groups at PD initiation. Patients using low-GDP PDF also experienced a slower rate of decline of residual glomerular filtration and urine output than did patients on conventional PDF. Compared with serum concentrations, effluent concentrations of tumor necrosis factor &#x3b1;, hepatocyte growth factor, macrophage migration inhibitory factor, interleukins 8 and 6, C-reactive protein, and leptin were found to be higher in both groups of patients after long-term PD, suggesting that the peritoneal cavity was the major source of those mediators. Compared with patients on low-GDP PDF, patients on conventional fluid showed elevated leptin and reduced adiponectin levels in serum and effluent. The effluent concentration of interleukin 8 was significantly lower in patients using low-GDP PDF. The survival rate and incidence of cardiovascular complications did not differ between these groups after maintenance PD for an average of 3.6 years. It appears that low-GDP PDF results in an improvement of local peritoneal homeostasis through a reduction of chronic inflammatory status in the peritoneum.",

We investigated the effect of dietary fatty acid interaction with PPARG, PPARA and ADIPOQ gene variants on plasma lipid and adiponectin concentrations in the Reading Imperial Surrey Cambridge King's study, a five-centre, parallel design, randomised controlled trial of 466 subjects at increased cardiometabolic risk.

Habitual dietary PUFA:SFA ratio&#xd7;PPARG Pro12Ala genotype interaction influenced plasma total cholesterol (P=0&#xb7;02), LDL-cholesterol (P=0&#xb7;002) and TAG (P=0&#xb7;02) concentrations in White subjects. PPARA Val162Leu&#xd7;PPARG Pro12Ala genotype interaction influenced total cholesterol (P=0&#xb7;04) and TAG (P=0&#xb7;03) concentrations at baseline. After high-MUFA and low-fat diets, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were reduced (P&lt;0&#xb7;001) and gene&#xd7;gene interaction determined LDL-cholesterol (P=0&#xb7;003) and small dense LDL as a proportion of LDL (P=0&#xb7;012). At baseline, ADIPOQ -10066 G/A A-allele was associated with lower serum adiponectin (n 360; P=0&#xb7;03) in White subjects. After the high-MUFA diet, serum adiponectin increased in GG subjects and decreased in A-allele carriers (P=0&#xb7;006 for difference). In GG, adiponectin increased with age after the high MUFA and decreased after the low-fat diet (P=0&#xb7;003 for difference at 60 years). In conclusion, in Whites, high dietary PUFA:SFA would help to reduce plasma cholesterol and TAG in PPARG Ala12 carriers. In ADIPOQ -10066 GG homozygotes, a high-MUFA diet may help to increase adiponectin with advancing age.",

    "abstract": "The association between a common variant of the ADIPOQ gene rs1501299 (+276G&gt;T) and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) outcomes has been reported with many studies. However, the evidence is insufficient for strong conclusions regarding CVDs and ADIPOQ rs15011299 (+276G&gt;T). We performed a meta-analysis about the association between ADIPOQ rs1501299 (+276G&gt;T) and CVDs risk using a predefined protocol, including 15 published studies with 5868 cases and 10,744 controls. The pooled data suggested a recessive protective effect of ADIPOQ rs1501299 (+276G&gt;T) on CVDs for type 2 diabetes (T2D) population: the TT homozygote individuals had a reduced risk of developing CVDs compared to the carriers of G allele (OR=0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.58, 0.94; p=0.013). But there is still not enough evidence to indicate the association of the ADIPOQ rs1501299 (+276G&gt;T) and the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) outcomes in general population. In conclusion, our meta-analysis suggested that the ADIPOQ rs1501299 (+276G&gt;T) polymorphism is a low-risk factor for the development of CVDs with T2D, but the association of this polymorphism with the susceptibility to CVDs in other populations remains unknown. It could be presumed that the ADIPOQ rs1501299 (+276G&gt;T) be a potential cause of susceptibility to CVDs in persons with T2D, and it gives a new opportunity to investigate the mechanisms of CVDs susceptibility in T2D patients.",

We recently showed that 6 months of diet, exercise, and metformin resulted in reductions in adiposity and that diet/exercise alone reduced proinflammatory factors and intrahepatic fat in pubertal children with uncomplicated obesity. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether changes in cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) after 6 months of structured diet and exercise (DE) or DE plus metformin are related to the previously observed changes in adiposity, markers of inflammation, and intrahepatic fat. Sixteen obese pubertal adolescents between the ages of 10 and 17 were randomized into a structured lifestyle program consisting of DE or DE plus metformin. Subjects performed aerobic and resistance exercise 3 d&#xb7;wk&#x207b;&#xb9;, 30 min per session. Cycle ergometer maximal oxygen consumption (V&#x2d9;O2max), body composition, blood markers (glucose, insulin, homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance, interleukin-6, hsCRP), and intrahepatic fat were measured at baseline and 6 months. In the cohort, as whole-body weight decreased by 4.0% (P = 0.009), body mass index decreased by 4.9% (P = 0.003), percent body fat decreased by 8.8% (P &lt; 0.001), and V&#x2d9;O2max improved in 10 of 16 subjects. The addition of metformin provided no further effect on body composition, CRF, or inflammatory factors. More favorable changes in adiposity, adiponectin, and a trend toward blood glucose and interleukin-6 concentrations (P = 0.07) were observed in subjects who increased V&#x2d9;O2max at 6 months (n = 10) compared with no change in these variables in those who did not improve V&#x2d9;O2max. Metformin did not provide benefits above lifestyle modification for improving CRF in obese adolescents. Improvements in V&#x2d9;O2max seem to be associated with more favorable metabolic outcomes.",

    "abstract": "To systematically evaluate low serum adiponectin level as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). A meta-analysis was performed to quantitatively analyse the association of serum total adiponectin level with CVD using previous case-control studies in Han Chinese populations. Several electronic databases were searched for relevant articles up to July 2011. A total of nine (n = 933), eight (n = 939) articles were included in each meta-analysis regarding the association of serum adiponectin level with coronary heart disease (CHD) and ischaemic stroke, respectively. Publication bias was examined by the Egger's linear regression test. Sensitivity analysis was performed by omitting one study at a time, and the pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) was estimated using fixed-effects model and random-effects model, respectively. Serum total adiponectin concentrations were lower in patients with CHD and ischaemic stroke, with pooled SMD of -1&#xb7;41 (95% CI -1&#xb7;69, -1&#xb7;12, P &lt; 0&#xb7;00001) and -1&#xb7;69 (95% CI -2&#xb7;04, -1&#xb7;33, P &lt; 0&#xb7;00001), respectively. By performing a meta-regression analysis, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, study size, adiponectin measurement assays, gender and mean body mass index of cases failed to account for heterogeneity for comparisons between lower adiponectin level and ischaemic stroke. However, study size had significant effect on the association of lower adiponectin level with CHD and accounted for 96&#xb7;72% of the between-study variance. No publication bias was detected. No single study was found to affect the overall result of each analysis by sensitivity testing. The accumulated evidence suggested that low serum adiponectin level increased the risk of a first cardiovascular event in the Han Chinese population. Further study is recommended with larger sample size to explore the role of hypoadiponectinemia in the causation of CVD.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin, an insulin-sensitizing adipokine, is inversely associated with adiposity and prostate cancer risk and progression. However, the role of genetic variation in the adiponectin (ADIPOQ) and receptor genes (ADIPOR1/R2) in prostate cancer is largely unknown. In a nested case-control study of 1,286 cases and 1,267 controls within the Physicians' Health Study, we evaluated 29 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in ADIPOQ (n = 13), ADIPOR1 (n = 5), and ADIPOR2 (n = 11) in relation to the risk of prostate cancer. In subgroups, we also evaluated the association of genotype and circulating adiponectin levels (n = 951) and prostate tumor expression of insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-IR) receptor (n = 181). Among the 12 tagging polymorphisms in ADIPOQ, four (rs266729, rs182052, rs822391, and rs2082940) were significantly associated (P &lt; 0.05) with overall prostate cancer risk, with no significant difference by tumor grade or clinical stage. Two of the risk SNPs (rs266729 and rs182052) plus four other SNPs (rs16861209, rs17366568, rs3774261, and rs7639352) were also associated with plasma adiponectin levels, and three of these (rs1686109, rs17366568, and rs3774261) were also significantly associated with IR expression in prostate tumor tissue. One additional SNP was associated with IGFI-R tumor tissue expression (rs16861205). None of the 16 variants in ADIPOR1/R2 were related to cancer risk or circulating adiponectin levels. Common variants in the adiponectin gene were associated with prostate cancer risk, plasma adiponectin levels, and IR or IGF-IR expression in the prostate tumor. These genotype-phenotype associations support the biological relevance of adiponectin for prostate carcinogenesis, particularly in earlier stages of development.",

This study examines the effects of simvastatin combined with rosiglitazone on vascular inflammation, oxidant stress, ambulatory blood pressure (BP) and other atherosclerotic factors in patients with the metabolic syndrome. This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study in 53 subjects with the metabolic syndrome. Participants were randomized to simvastatin 40 mg/day plus placebo vs. simvastatin 40 mg/day plus rosiglitazone 4 mg/day for 6 months. The primary endpoint was the between-group difference in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and secondary variables including urinary isoprostanes, serum malondialdehyde (MDA), ambulatory BP, adiponectin, and lipid and glycaemic profiles. At study end, the group randomized to the simvastatin/rosiglitazone combination had a greater reduction in hs-CRP of 1.33 mg/dl, (p = 0.029) and showed a trend for a greater reduction in urinary isoprostane (-39%), (p = 0.056) compared to simvastatin/placebo group. Changes in MDA levels did not differed between groups (p = 0.81). 24-h systolic blood pressure (SBP) also showed a 4.5 mmHg reduction at 6 months (p = 0.06). Adiponectin levels increased by 3.91 &#xb5;g/ml in the combination group over placebo, (p = 0.03) and blood glucose decreased in combination group vs. placebo. Our data show that patients with the metabolic syndrome given a statin/TZD combination manifest greater reductions in markers of vascular inflammation and oxidant stress, 24-h ambulatory BP and increases in adiponectin as well as improved glycaemic indices.",

    "abstract": "Common genetic variations in the leptin (LEP), leptin receptor (LEPR), and paraoxonase 1 (PON1) genes have been considered to be implicated in the development of breast cancer. However, the results were inconsistent. In this study, a meta-analysis was performed to assess the associations of five polymorphisms, including LEP G2548A, LEPR Q223R, LEPR Lys109Arg, PON1 L55M, and PON1 Q192R polymorphisms, with breast cancer risk. Published literature from PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Embase databases, CNKI, and Wanfang Data were retrieved. All studies evaluating the association between LEP G2548A, LEPR Q223R, LEPR Lys109Arg, PON1 L55M, or PON1 Q192R polymorphism and breast cancer risk were included. Pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using fixed- or random-effects model. Three studies (2,003 cases and 1,967 controls) for LEP G2548A polymorphism, nine studies (4,627 cases and 5,476 controls) for LEPR Q223R polymorphism, five studies (2,759 cases and 2,573 controls) for LEPR Lys109Arg polymorphism, four studies (1,517 cases and 1,379 controls) for PON1 L55M polymorphism, and five studies (1,575 cases and 2,283 controls) for PON1 Q192R polymorphism were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, the results showed null significant association between LEP G2548A, LEPR Q223R, LEPR Lys109Arg, or PON1 Q192R polymorphism and breast cancer risk; however, PON1 L55M was significantly associated with breast cancer risk overall (MM vs. LL: OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.16; 95% CI, 1.76-2.66). For LEPR Q223R polymorphism, further subgroup analysis suggested that the association was only statistically significant in East Asians (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.50; 95% CI, 0.36-0.70) but not in Caucasians (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.06; 95% CI, 0.77-1.45) or Africans (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.30; 95% CI, 0.83-2.03). The present meta-analysis suggested that LEPR Q223R polymorphism might be implicated in the development of breast cancer in East Asians; PON1 L55M might increase breast cancer risk. However, given the limited sample size, the findings warrant further investigation.",

    "abstract": "We designed this study, to investigate the predicting effect of a single resistance exercise session on serum level of RBP4 and adiponectin in trained and untrained subjects and to evaluate whether regular training may affect the response of these adipokines to exercise. Thirty four healthy young male students including 19 trained and 15 untrained participated in this study; each group was then randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. The exercise session prolonged 120 minutes intensive resistance program at 70%-80% of 1RM. The blood samples were collected just before the start of training program and 4 hours post exercise to evaluate concentration of adiponectin, RBP4 and CRP as well as other metabolic markers. The serum level of adiponectin, RBP4 and CRP was not significantly different between trained and untrained groups at baseline. More over four hours post exercise adipokines concentration and CRP didn't differ between groups. Adjusted regression model showed, basal adiponectin (&#x3b2;=0.59, p=&lt;0.001) and HDL cholesterol (&#x3b2;=0.28, p=0.09) were the main predictors of post exercise adiponectin concentration. In addition, the basic level of RBP4 appeared to be the only predictor of after exercise RBP4 concentration (&#x3b2;=0.46, p=0.02). Neither one session of high intensity resistance exercise nor long term training had predicting effect on post exercise adiponectin and RBP4 concentration in healthy young men. In the other hand, the beneficial effect of acute resistance exercise training may not be reflected by changes in adiponectin, RBP4 and CRP concentration in healthy young individual no matter they trained or untrained.",

    "abstract": "Preadipocyte factor 1 (pref-1) is increased in anorexia nervosa and is associated negatively with bone mineral density (BMD). No previous studies exist on pref-1 in women with exercise-induced hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA), which similar to anorexia nervosa, is an energy-deficiency state associated with hypoleptinemia. Our objective was to evaluate whether pref-1 levels are also elevated and associated with low BMD and to assess whether leptin regulates pref-1 levels in women with HA. Study 1 was a double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of metreleptin administration in women with HA. Study 2 was an open-label study of metreleptin administration in low physiological, supraphysiological, and pharmacological doses in healthy women volunteers. At Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, 20 women with HA and leptin levels higher than 5 ng/ml and nine healthy control women participated in study 1, and five healthy women participated in study 2. For study 1, 20 HA subjects were randomized to receive either 0.08 mg/kg metreleptin (n = 11) or placebo (n = 9). For study 2, five healthy subjects received 0.01, 0.1, and 0.3 mg/kg metreleptin in both fed and fasting conditions for 1 and 3 d, respectively. Circulating pref-1 and leptin levels were measured. Pref-1 was significantly higher in HA subjects vs. controls (P = 0.035) and negatively associated with BMD (&#x3c1; = -0.38; P &lt; 0.01) and bone mineral content (&#x3c1; = -0.32; P &lt; 0.05). Metreleptin administration did not alter pref-1 levels in any study reported herein. Pref-1 is higher in HA subjects than controls. Metreleptin administration at low physiological, supraphysiological, and pharmacological doses does not affect pref-1 levels, suggesting that hypoleptinemia is not responsible for higher pref-1 levels and that leptin does not regulate pref-1.",

    "abstract": "We analyzed specific effects of an add-on therapy with pioglitazone compared to metformin and their combination in patients with basal insulin treatment on biomarkers of CV risk. In this double-blind, randomized, multicentre, active comparator controlled trial, 121 patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled. Inclusions: treatment with basal insulin, HbA(1C) 6.5%-8.5%, age 30-75 years. After glargine therapy over 2 weeks for titration towards FBG &#x2264; 7.8 mmol/L, patients received either (A) bid 850 mg metformin (n = 42), (B) bid 15 mg pioglitazone (n = 40), or (C) 30 mg pioglitazone plus 1.7 g metformin (n = 39) over 6 months. Matrix Metal Proteinase 9 (MMP-9) was primary objective, together with biomarkers of CV risk. Pioglitazone (B) reduced MMP-9 versus baseline by 54.1 &#xb1; 187.1 ng/mL, with metformin (A) it was increased by 49.6 &#xb1; 336.2 ng/mL (p = 0.0345; B vs. A), and with the combination of both (C) it was decreased by 67.8 &#xb1; 231.4 ng/mL (A vs. C: p = 0.0416; B vs. C: p = 0.8695). After logarithmic transformation due to high variances the exploratory results showed significance for A vs. B (p = 0.0043) and for A vs. C (p = 0.0289).Insulin dosage was reduced by 7.3 units in group B (p &lt; 0.0001), by 6.0 units in C (p = 0.0004), but was increased by 2.5 units (p = 0.1539) in A at follow up. Reduction in hs-CRP was significant within treatment groups for B (p = 0.0098) and C (p &lt; 0.0001), and between the groups for A vs. C (p = 0.0124). All three single regimens reduced PAI-1. Adiponectin was significantly elevated in B and C (p &lt; 0.0001) and between-groups. HbA(1C) was only significantly decreased in the combination group. No significant effects were observed for NFkB and PGF&#x3b1;. peripheral edema were seen in 11.9% vs. 40.0% vs. 20.5%, and weight change was -0.7 kg vs. +4.3 kg vs. +2.7 kg (A vs. B vs. C). Addition of pioglitazone but not of metformin reduces MMP-9, hs-CRP and increased insulin sensitivity and adiponectin in this study. The combination of both had no additional effect on inflammation. Pioglitazone is suggested to be a rational add-on therapy to basal insulin in patients with high CV risk.",

In all, 55 adults with biopsy-confirmed NASH were randomized to receive PTX at a dose of 400 mg three times a day (n = 26) or placebo (n = 29) over 1 year. The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as improvement in histological features of NASH through reduction in steatosis, lobular inflammation, and/or hepatocellular ballooning as reflected by a decrease of &#x2265; 2 points in the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) activity score (NAS). After 1 year, intention-to-treat analysis showed a decrease of &#x2265; 2 points in the NAS in 38.5% of patients on PTX versus 13.8% of those on placebo (P = 0.036). Per protocol analysis, a decrease of &#x2265; 2 points in the NAS from baseline was observed in 50% of the patients on PTX versus 15.4% of those on placebo (P = 0.01). The mean change in NAS score from baseline was -1.6 in the PTX group, versus -0.1 in the placebo group (P &lt; 0.001). PTX significantly improved steatosis (mean change in score -0.9 versus -0.04 with placebo, P &lt; 0.001) and lobular inflammation (median change -1 versus 0 with placebo, P = 0.02). No significant effects in hepatocellular ballooning were observed. PTX also improved liver fibrosis (mean change in fibrosis score was -0.2 among those on PTX versus +0.4 among those on placebo, P = 0.038). Although not statistically significant (P = 0.17), improvement in fibrosis was observed in a greater proportion (35%) of patients in the PTX group compared to placebo (15%). Adverse effects were similar in both groups. PTX improved histological features of NASH compared to placebo. PTX was well tolerated in patients with NASH.",

    "title": "Impact of trandolapril therapy and its combination with a calcium channel blocker on plasma adiponectin levels in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin is secreted from adipose tissue and exhibits a protective effect against cardiovascular disease; plasma adiponectin concentrations are decreased in type 2 diabetic and in hypertensive patients. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of trandolapril (T) and its fixed-dose combination with verapamil (FDTV) on adiponectin levels in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients. A total of 40 type 2 diabetic patients with never-treated hypertension were randomly assigned to two groups. One group received FDTV 180&#x2009;mg&#x2009;+&#x2009;T 2&#x2009;mg, once a day; the other group received T 2&#x2009;mg once a day, administered for 3 months in both groups. Adiponectin was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at the beginning and end of the study. Patients were evaluated monthly for blood pressure, fasting serum glucose and adverse events. Statistical analysis was performed with analysis of variance (ANOVA). All patients experienced a significant reduction of blood pressure. Both therapeutics regimens increased the levels of adiponectin, However, FDTV produces a higher increase in the levels of the hormone (8.15&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.6 to 10.96&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.6&#x2009;&#xb5;g/ml) when compared with the T treatment (7.64&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.8 to 8.92&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.4&#x2009;&#xb5;g/ml), p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05. None of the patients suffered adverse events. Our results show that the addition of FDTV to T produced a greater increase on adiponectin levels than trandolapril alone.",

    "title": "Leptin administered in physiological or pharmacological doses does not regulate circulating angiogenesis factors in humans.",
    "abstract": "Leptin has been shown to regulate angiogenesis in animal and in vitro studies by upregulating the production of several pro-angiogenic factors, but its role in regulating angiogenesis has never been studied in humans. The potential angiogenic effect of two doses of metreleptin (50 and 100 ng/ml) was evaluated in vitro, using a novel three-dimensional angiogenesis assay. Fifteen healthy, normoleptinaemic volunteers were administered both a physiological (0.1 mg/kg) and a pharmacological (0.3 mg/kg) single dose of metreleptin, in vivo, on two different inpatient admissions separated by 1-12 weeks. Serum was collected at 0, 6, 12 and 24 h after metreleptin administration. Twenty lean women, with leptin levels &lt;5 ng/ml, were randomised in a 1:1 fashion to receive either physiological replacement doses of metreleptin (0.04-0.12 mg/kg q.d.) or placebo for 32 weeks. Serum was collected at 0, 8, 20 and 32 weeks after randomisation. Proteomic angiogenesis array analysis was performed to screen for angiogenic factors. Circulating concentrations of angiogenin, angiopoietin-1, platelet derived endothelial factor (PDGF)-AA, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 8 and 9, endothelial growth factor (EGF) and vascular EGF (VEGF) were also measured. Both metreleptin doses failed to induce angiogenesis in the in vitro model. Although leptin levels increased significantly in response to both short-term and long-term metreleptin administration, circulating concentrations of angiogenesis markers did not change significantly in vivo. This is the first study that examines the effect of metreleptin administration in angiogenesis in humans. Metreleptin administration does not regulate circulating angiogenesis related factors in humans. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00140205 and NCT00130117.

    "abstract": "Polymorphisms in adipokine genes, such as leptin (LEP), leptin receptor (LEPR), resistin (RETN), adiponectin (ADIPOQ), interleukin-1&#x3b2; (IL-1&#x3b2;), IL-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1; (TNF-&#x3b1;) may be involved in the development of obesity. We conducted a systematic review of published evidence on the association between different adipokine genes and the risk of obesity. Librarian-designed searches of PubMed and HuGeNet, review of reference lists from published reviews and content expert advice identified potentially eligible studies. The genotyping information and polymorphisms of different adipokine genes, numbers of genotyped cases and controls and frequencies of genotypes were extracted from 48 eligible studies included in this review. Twenty-one polymorphisms each associated with obesity in at least one study were identified. Polymorphisms in the adipokine genes, LEP, LEPR, and RETN were not associated with obesity susceptibility, whereas ADIPOQ G276T (T vs. G: odds ratio (OR), 1.59; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.39-1.81), IL-1&#x3b2; C3953T (CC vs. CT+TT: OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.18-2.20), and TNF-&#x3b1; G308A (GG vs. GA+AA: OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.02-1.39) polymorphisms were associated with an increased risk of obesity. The IL-6 G174C polymorphism was also associated obesity when using allelic comparisons, the recessive genetic model and the dominant genetic model with OR (95% CI) of 1.95 (1.37-2.77), 1.44 (1.15-1.80), and 1.36 (1.16-1.59), respectively. No significant evidence of publication bias was present. However, these null results were underpowered due to a small pooled sample size, and analysis of additional case-control studies with larger sample sizes should provide further clarifications.",

    "abstract": "Leptin has been reported to exert an atherosclerotic effect by regulating expression of angiogenic factors that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease (CAD). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) with statins could affect leptin levels and angiogenic factors in patients with CAD. This study included 76 patients with CAD and 15 subjects without CAD (non-CAD). CAD patients were randomized to 6&#xa0;months of intensive LLT with atorvastatin or moderate LLT with pravastatin. Plasma leptin, angiopoetin-2 (Ang-2), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels were measured prior to statin therapy (baseline) and after 6&#xa0;months. Baseline levels of leptin, Ang-2, HGF and VEGF were higher in the CAD group than in the non-CAD group (all P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05). Treatment with intensive LLT decreased leptin, Ang-2, HGF and VEGF levels, whereas moderate LLT did not change these levels. This study suggests that LLT with atorvastatin decreases leptin levels and angiogenic factors in patients with CAD, possibly contributing to the beneficial effects of LLT with atorvastatin in CAD.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin, an adipocytokine, is secreted by fatty cells and exerts a regulatory role in atherogenesis, modulating foam cell formation and cellular adhesion. In stable atherosclerosis, plasma adiponectin has been reported to be associated with both increased and decreased cardiovascular risk. Recent data have suggested a possible discordant adverse risk relationship in acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Therefore, we investigated the association between adiponectin and cardiovascular events in patients with ACS. We measured plasma adiponectin in 3,931 patients stabilized following ACS and assessed the relationship with 2-year outcome. Patients were followed for all-cause death and major cardiovascular events. Using multivariable Cox regression, we adjusted for age, sex, race, ACS type, diabetes, smoking status, triglycerides, blood pressure, body mass index, estimated glomerular filtration rate, treatment group (atorvastatin), B-type natriuretic peptide, and C-reactive protein. Adiponectin correlated negatively with age, diabetes, body mass index, and triglycerides (each, P &lt; .001) but showed a positive relationship with the risk of death (P = .01), myocardial infarction (P = .01), and heart failure (P &lt; .001). After adjusting for clinical risk factors, B-type natriuretic peptide, and C-reactive protein, adiponectin greater than the median (4,477 ng/mL) was independently associated with an increased risk of death or myocardial infarction (hazard ratio 1.58, 95% CI 1.10-2.28, P = .013) and congestive heart failure (hazard ratio 2.17, 95% CI 1.21-3.89, P = .010). Higher adiponectin concentrations early after ACS are independently associated with a higher risk of recurrent cardiovascular events. This finding is directionally opposite to that observed in patients at risk for atherosclerosis and reveals the need for investigation to elucidate differences in the pathobiology of adiponectin in stable versus unstable coronary artery disease.",

    "abstract": "Vaspin and visfatin have emerged as novel adipokines, involved in atherosclerosis progression. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of atorvastatin and lifestyle modification on the above adipokines in hypercholesterolemic patients. One hundred four statin-free subjects with moderate cardiovascular risk (Framingham risk score of 10-20%) were randomly assigned to receive either atorvastatin 20mg per day (AT group, n=52) or lifestyle modification (LM, group, n=52). For comparison, age and gender-matched blood donors, without any chronic cardiovascular or metabolic disease served as healthy controls (HC group, n=40). Clinical and anthropometrical parameters, lipids, fasting glucose, serum vaspin, visfatin and insulin levels were obtained at the beginning and after 12 weeks. At the end of the study, intra-group and inter-group comparison revealed that atorvastatin administration considerably ameliorated most lipid parameters and downregulated hsCRP levels (p=0.002, p=0.041, respectively). Moreover, we observed a significant increase of vaspin concentrations after 12-week atorvastatin treatment (from 1.37&#xb1;0.6ng/ml to 2.13&#xb1;0.61ng/ml), as compared to baseline (p=0.007) and LM group (p=0.030). In standard multiple regression analysis, the atorvastatin-induced decrease of vaspin was independently associated with hsCRP reduction (p=0.015). On the other hand, within and between groups comparison revealed a non-significant (p&gt;0.05) reduction of visfatin serum levels. In our study, lifestyle modification had totally modest influence on clinical and biochemical variables (p&gt;0.05). In hypercholesterolemic patients with moderate estimated cardiovascular risk, atorvastatin administration reduced hsCRP and increased serum vaspin levels compared to lifestyle modification. The relation of those pleiotropic, non-lipid-lowering effects of statins with their clinical outcomes remains to be proved.",

    "abstract": "We hypothesized that, besides type 2 diabetes (T2D) and body mass index (BMI), circulating adiponectin concentration would be associated with variants of the ADIPOQ gene in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). We also assessed the influence of these confounders on the prognostic value of adiponectin. Plasma adiponectin was measured at entry and after 3 months in approximately 1200 patients with CHF enrolled in the GISSI-HF trial. Four common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the ADIPOQ gene were studied: rs17300539 (-11391G&#x2192;A), rs266729 (-11377C&#x2192;G), rs2241766 (+45T&#x2192;G) and rs1501299 (+276G&#x2192;T). Associations with clinical characteristics and mortality were evaluated in patients with or without T2D. Adiponectin concentrations were negatively related to BMI, higher in women and older persons, but lower in patients with diabetes. T-allele carriers for rs1501299 and A-allele carriers for rs17300539 had significantly elevated adiponectin concentrations. Irrespective of diabetes, baseline plasma adiponectin was independently associated with mortality (adjusted HR [95%CI] per 1 SD increase in adiponectin concentration = 1&#xb7;24[1&#xb7;12-1&#xb7;37], P &lt; 0&#xb7;0001) and improved prognostic discrimination beyond clinical risk factors (integrated discrimination improvement, P = 0&#xb7;005). Patients with increasing adiponectin concentration over 3 months had worse outcome than those with stable levels (unadjusted HR = 1&#xb7;46[1&#xb7;09-1&#xb7;96], P = 0&#xb7;01); this relation was attenuated by the genetic variants examined and by robust confounders like age, diabetes, BMI or NT-proBNP (adjusted HR = 1&#xb7;37[0&#xb7;97-1&#xb7;94], P = 0&#xb7;075). Although diabetes and genetic variants at the ADIPOQ gene influence the circulating levels of adiponectin in CHF, higher plasma adipokine levels, but not genetic variants, are consistently associated with a poor prognosis.",

At 8 weeks, in the MA group the body weight increased (2.3 kg) with respect to the control group (0.1 kg) (p&lt;0.04). MA improved significantly the triceps skin-fold thickness (p &lt; 0.04), prealbumin (p&lt;0.004), lymphocytes (p&lt;0.0006), C3 (p&lt;0.04), PCO(2) (p&lt;0.007) and bicarbonate levels (p&lt;0.008). MA did not increase the MRC and SGRQ scales, the distance of 6 MWT nor BODE index. The IL-6 and TNF alpha levels were not modified in the MA group, but leptin did increase (p&lt;0.043). MA improved the sense of wellbeing (p&lt;0.02) and the appetite (p&lt;0.008), compared to the control group. Adverse effects were similar in both groups. MA safely increases the body weight and the appetite in severe COPD patients with weight loss. MA improves blood gases and nutritional parameters and the sense of wellbeing, but it does not improve the respiratory muscular function or exercise tolerance.",

    "abstract": "Animal studies in vivo indicate that leptin treatment in extremely leptin-sensitive ob/ob mice reduces body weight exclusively by reducing fat mass and that it increases muscle mass by downregulating myostatin expression. Data from human trials are limited. Therefore, we aimed at characterizing the effects of leptin administration on fat mass, lean body mass, and circulating regulators of muscle growth in hypoleptinemic and presumably leptin-sensitive human subjects. In an open-label, single-arm trial, seven lean, strenuously exercising, amenorrheic women with low leptin concentrations (&#x2264;5 ng/ml) were given recombinant methionyl human leptin (metreleptin; 0.08 mg&#xb7;kg(-1)&#xb7;day(-1)) for 10 wk. In a separate randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, seven women were given metreleptin (initial dose: 0.08 mg&#xb7;kg(-1)&#xb7;day(-1) for 3 mo, increased thereafter to 0.12 mg&#xb7;kg(-1)&#xb7;day(-1) if menstruation did not occur), and six were given placebo for 9 mo. Metreleptin significantly reduced total body fat by an average of 18.6% after 10 wk (P &lt; 0.001) in the single-arm trial and by 19.5% after 9 mo (placebo subtracted; P for interaction = 0.025, P for metreleptin = 0.004) in the placebo-controlled trial. There were no significant changes in lean body mass (P &#x2265; 0.33) or in serum concentrations of myostatin (P &#x2265; 0.35), follistatin (P &#x2265; 0.30), and activin A (P &#x2265; 0.20) whether in the 10-wk trial or the 9-mo trial. We conclude that metreleptin administration in lean hypoleptinemic women reduces fat mass exclusively and does not affect lean body mass or the myostatin-follistatin-activin axis.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS) represents a high risk of cardiovascular disease. We compared the effect of early intervention with pioglitazone versus voglibose on physical and metabolic profiles and serum adiponectin level in patients with T2DM associated with MetS. Sixty patients who were diagnosed for the first time as T2DM associated with MetS were analyzed for insulin sensitivity, lipid profile, serum adiponectin and systemic inflammation. Those patients were randomly assigned to oral pioglitazone group (n = 30) or voglibose group (n = 30) in addition to conventional diet and exercise training. Body mass index and waist circumference did not change in the pioglitazone group, whereas these physical parameters significantly decreased in the voglibose group during a 6-month follow-up period. However, glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose, and HOMA-IR more significantly decreased in the pioglitazone group. The level of serum adiponectin especially high-molecular weight adiponectin markedly increased in the pioglitazone group. Moreover, high sensitive CRP significantly decreased only in the pioglitazone group. These results suggest that voglibose is superior in improving obesity, while pioglitazone is superior in ameliorating insulin sensitivity and increasing serum adiponectin in patients with an early stage of T2DM associated with MetS.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the effect of postprandial glucose reduction by acarbose on insulin sensitivity and biomarkers of systemic inflammation. This was a single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study &lt;40 weeks in duration, involving 66 subjects with varying degrees of glucose tolerance. Eligible patients completed a 3-week run-in period and were randomized to receive either 100&#x2009;mg of acarbose three times daily followed by placebo, or vice versa, lasting 12 weeks each with a 12-week washout between interventions. Liquid meal challenges and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic glucose clamp were performed at weeks 0, 12, 24, and 36. Fasting proinsulin levels and proinsulin-to-adiponectin ratios but not fasting adiponectin levels were significantly lower during acarbose versus placebo treatment. Clamp-derived insulin sensitivity index and body weight were unchanged by the intervention. Levels of fasting insulin, fasting glucose, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1&#x3b2; were comparable between treatments. In the liquid meal challenge tests, postprandial glucose and insulin responses were significantly lower during acarbose versus placebo treatment. The effects of acarbose on the reduction of fasting proinsulin was most pronounced in subjects with impaired fasting glucose/impaired glucose tolerance (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;24). Reduction of the glycemic load by acarbose decreased fasting levels of proinsulin but had no effect on adiponectin and whole-body insulin sensitivity as well as biomarkers reflecting inflammation. The preventive effects of acarbose on type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular risk need further investigation and cannot be explained by changes of insulin resistance and inflammatory biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) is associated with dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-peripheral endocrine axes, leading to infertility and bone loss, and usually is caused by chronic energy deficiency secondary to strenuous exercise and/or decreased food intake. Energy deficiency also leads to hypoleptinemia, which has been proposed, on the basis of observational studies as well as an open-label study, to mediate the neuroendocrine abnormalities associated with this condition. To prove definitively a causal role of leptin in the pathogenesis of HA, we performed a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of human recombinant leptin (metreleptin) in replacement doses over 36 wk in women with HA. We assessed its effects on reproductive outcomes, neuroendocrine function, and bone metabolism. Leptin replacement resulted in recovery of menstruation and corrected the abnormalities in the gonadal, thyroid, growth hormone, and adrenal axes. We also demonstrated changes in markers of bone metabolism suggestive of bone formation, but no changes in bone mineral density were detected over the short duration of this study. If these data are confirmed, metreleptin administration in replacement doses to normalize circulating leptin levels may prove to be a safe and effective therapy for women with HA.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin is an adipose-derived protein with beneficial metabolic effects. Low adiponectin is associated with obesity and related diseases. Significant weight loss increases adiponectin, reducing disease risk. This study compared the effects of two weight-loss diets with different macronutrient compositions on adiponectin. Eighty-one obese women in two cohorts were randomized to a low-fat (LF) or a low-carbohydrate (LC) diet. All subjects underwent equivalent weight-loss intervention, with weight and other measures assessed at baseline and after 6 (cohort I) or 4 (cohort II) months. Body fat was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Adiponectin was measured by radioimmunoassay. Diet intake was assessed using 24-h recalls and 3-day diet records. Data were analyzed via t-tests and repeated-measures factorial ANOVA using time, diet, and replicate (cohort I vs. cohort II) as factors. Age, weight, body fat, BMI, adiponectin, and diet were similar at baseline. Following intervention, macronutrient composition of the diet was vastly different between the groups, reflecting the assigned diet. Both groups lost weight and body fat (P &lt; 0.001), with effect in LC dieters greater than LF dieters (-9.1 kg vs. -4.97 kg weight, P &lt; 0.05 and -5.45 kg vs. -2.62 kg fat, P &lt; 0.001). Adiponectin increased in the LC (+1.92 mcg/ml, P &lt; 0.01), but not the LF (+0.86 mcg/ml, P = 0.81), group. There was no correlation between weight loss and increase in adiponectin. These results confirm that diet-induced loss of weight and body fat is associated with increased adiponectin concentrations. This effect is evident with weight loss of 10% or more, and may be greater with LC diets.",

We thus examined whether vaspin and visfatin are affected by short- and long-term energy deprivation and leptin administration in human subjects in vivo. We measured circulating levels of vaspin and visfatin i) before and after 72&#x200a;h of starvation (leading to severe hypoleptinemia) with or without leptin administration in replacement doses in 13 normal-weight subjects, ii) before and after 72&#x200a;h of starvation with leptin administration in pharmacological doses in 13 lean and obese subjects, iii) during chronic energy deficiency in eight women with hypothalamic amenorrhea on leptin replacement for 3 months, and iv) during chronic energy deficiency in 18 women with hypothalamic amenorrhea on leptin replacement or placebo for 3 months. Acute starvation decreased serum leptin to 21% of baseline values, (P=0.002) but had no significant effect on vaspin and visfatin concentrations (P&gt;0.05). Nor did normalization of leptin levels affect the concentrations of these two adipokines (P&gt;0.9). Leptin replacement in women with hypothalamic amenorrhea did not significantly alter vaspin and visfatin concentrations, whether relative to baseline or placebo administration (P&gt;0.25). Pharmacological doses of leptin did not affect circulating vaspin and visfatin concentrations (P&gt;0.9). Circulating vaspin and visfatin are not affected by acute or chronic energy deficiency leading to hypoleptinemia and are not regulated by leptin in human subjects, indicating that these adipocyte-secreted hormonal regulators of metabolism are independently regulated in humans.",

    "abstract": "Thiazolidinediones such as rosiglitazone (RSG) are insulin-sensitizing agents, which may improve inflammation and vascular function, and thus potentially lower cardiovascular risk in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, there is growing concern about the adverse cardiovascular effects of RSG in diabetic patients without CKD, and the data in patients with CKD remain conflicting. This study examines the effect of RSG on vascular function in patients with CKD. A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study comparing RSG 4 mg daily (n = 35) with placebo (n = 35) for 8 weeks was performed in CKD subjects. Primary outcome measures were flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), systemic arterial compliance (SAC) and augmentation index (AIx). Secondary outcomes included glyceryl trinitrate-mediated dilatation (GTN-MD), pulse-wave velocity (PWV), lipids, blood pressure, homoeostasis model assessment (HOMA), adiponectin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and high-sensitivity interleukin 6 (hs-IL-6) and in vivo marker of endothelial function [von Willebrand Factor (vWF)]. RSG lowered HOMA score [RSG geometric mean 1.7 (95% confidence interval 1.3-2.3); placebo 1.9 (1.4-2.5), P = 0.04], hs-CRP [RSG 1.2 (0.9-1.7) mg/L; placebo 1.6 (1.2-2.3), P = 0.04] and vWF [RSG mean 126.1 &#xb1; SD 45.7%; placebo 132.7 &#xb1; 41.7, P = 0.01] but not hs-IL-6. RSG did not significantly change arterial function (FMD, GTN-MD, SAC), arterial stiffness (AIx, PWV) or blood pressure. RSG increased triglyceride concentration [RSG 1.8 (1.3-1.9) mmol/L; placebo 1.5 (1.3-1.9), P = 0.01] without affecting other lipid and lipoprotein concentrations. Short-term RSG therapy reduced insulin resistance, in vivo markers of inflammation and abnormal endothelial function but had no effect on arterial function and stiffness in patients with CKD.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of fat gain on cardiac autonomic control during wakefulness and sleep in humans. We performed a randomized, controlled study to assess the effects of fat gain on heart rate variability. We recruited 36 healthy volunteers, who were randomized to either a standardized diet to gain &#x2248;4 kg over 8 weeks followed by an 8-week weight loss period (n=20) or to serve as a weight-maintainer control (n=16). An overnight polysomnogram with power spectral analysis of heart rate variability was performed at baseline, after weight gain, and after weight loss to determine the ratio of low-frequency to high-frequency power and to examine the relationship between changes in heart rate variability and changes in insulin, leptin, and adiponectin levels. Mean weight gain was 3.9 kg in the fat gain group versus 0.1 kg in the maintainer group. Low frequency/high frequency increased both during wakefulness and sleep after fat gain and returned to baseline after fat loss in the fat gain group and did not change in the control group. Insulin, leptin, and adiponectin also increased after fat gain and fell after fat loss, but no clear pattern of changes was seen that correlated consistently with changes in heart rate variability. Short-term fat gain in healthy subjects is associated with increased cardiac sympathetic activation during wakefulness and sleep, but the mechanisms remain unclear.",

    "title": "Adiponectin and adiponectin receptor in relation to colorectal cancer progression.",
    "abstract": "Although obesity is a risk factor for colorectal cancer, the underlying mechanism is not clear. Adiponectin is an adipokine that binds to 2 types of receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2. The plasma concentrations of adiponectin are reduced in obese individuals and adiponectin has been reported to have anticarcinogenic properties. Furthermore, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 have been reported to be expressed in several malignancies. However, little is known about the expression of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 in colorectal cancer and its clinicopathological implications. In addition, the relationship between adiponectin and colorectal cancer has not yet been determined. Here, we sought to investigate adiponectin and adiponectin receptors in relation to colorectal cancer. AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 immunostaining was detected in 72 and 68% of human colorectal cancer tissue, respectively. AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 expression levels were inversely related to T stage. The lowest AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 expression were detected in poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. RT-PCR also showed the expression of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 in HCT116 and SW620. MTT assay and TUNEL assay demonstrated the tendency of growth inhibition and apoptosis induction in both cell lines after full-length adiponectin treatment although statistically insignificant. Microarray analysis revealed several gene responses to full-length adiponectin, including upregulation of ENDOGL1 and MT1G. In conclusion, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 may be intimately related to the progression of colorectal cancer. Further studies may be warranted to assess adiponectin and its receptors as a novel target for inhibition of colorectal cancer growth.",

Systematic review and meta-analysis. Medline (1950 to October 2009) and Embase (1980 to October 2009) without limits. Two reviewers independently selected studies that examined adults without known cardiovascular disease and that compared fasting levels of specific biological markers associated with coronary heart disease after alcohol use with those after a period of no alcohol use (controls). 4690 articles were screened for eligibility, the full texts of 124 studies reviewed, and 63 relevant articles selected. Of 63 eligible studies, 44 on 13 biomarkers were meta-analysed in fixed or random effects models. Quality was assessed by sensitivity analysis of studies grouped by design. Analyses were stratified by type of beverage (wine, beer, spirits). Alcohol significantly increased levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (pooled mean difference 0.094 mmol/L, 95% confidence interval 0.064 to 0.123), apolipoprotein A1 (0.101 g/L, 0.073 to 0.129), and adiponectin (0.56 mg/L, 0.39 to 0.72). Alcohol showed a dose-response relation with high density lipoprotein cholesterol (test for trend P = 0.013). Alcohol decreased fibrinogen levels (-0.20 g/L, -0.29 to -0.11) but did not affect triglyceride levels. Results were similar for crossover and before and after studies, and across beverage types. Favourable changes in several cardiovascular biomarkers (higher levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol and adiponectin and lower levels of fibrinogen) provide indirect pathophysiological support for a protective effect of moderate alcohol use on coronary heart disease.",

Forty-four patients with the diagnosis of knee OA assigned into two groups were treated with local natural mineral-rich mud pack or hot pack. Treatments were applied for 6 days a week for 2 weeks as a total of 12 sessions. Patients were assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and 3 months after the treatment. VAS, range of motion, 15-m walking time, WOMAC index, Nottingham Health Profile, serum YKL-40, and hsCRP levels were the outcome measures. Pain intensity and joint stiffness decreased in both groups at all follow-ups. Physical activity status was found to persist for 3 months after treatment only in mud pack group. Serum mean YKL-40 and hsCRP levels of the patients were higher compared to healthy control group. Serum YKL-40 level increased significantly only in hot pack group 3 months after the treatment (P &lt; 0.017). No significant change was observed in hsCRP levels in both groups during the whole follow-up periods (P &gt; 0.05). Mud pack and hot pack therapy were both demonstrated to be effective in symptomatic treatment of knee OA until the end of the 2-week treatment period, whereas only mud pack therapy was shown to be effective in functional status over time. In the hot pack group, increased serum YKL-40 level 3 months after the treatment might indicate persistence of cartilage degradation. Maintenance of YKL-40 level in mud pack therapy seems to slow down the progression of knee OA.",

    "abstract": "Low-fat (LF) and high-fat (HF) weight loss diets improve brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in obese individuals, although results are conflicting. Moreover, the role that adipose tissue plays in mediating these diet-related effects are unknown. This study examined how modulations in FMD by HF and LF diets relate to changes in adipocyte parameters. Obese subjects (n = 17) were randomized to a HF diet (60% kcal as fat) or a LF diet (25% kcal as fat) for 6 weeks. Both groups were restricted by 25% of energy needs. Body weight decreased (P &lt;0.05) in both groups (HF: -6.6 &#xb1; 0.5 kg, LF: -4.7 &#xb1; 0.6 kg). Fat mass and waist circumference were reduced (P &lt;0.05) in the LF group only (-4.4 &#xb1; 0.3 kg; -3.6 &#xb1; 0.8 cm, respectively). FMD improved (P &lt;0.05) in the LF group (7.4 &#xb1; 0.8% to 9.8 &#xb1; 0.8; 32% increase) and was impaired in the HF group (8.5 &#xb1; 0.6% to 6.9 &#xb1; 0.7; 19% reduction). Increases in plasma adiponectin (P &lt;0.05, 16 &#xb1; 5%), and decreases in resistin (P &lt;0.05, -26 &#xb1; 11%), were shown by the LF diet only. Greater decreases in leptin were observed with LF (-48 &#xb1; 9%) versus HF (-28 &#xb1; 12%) (P &lt;0.05, diet &#xd7; time). Increased FMD by the LF diet was associated with increased adiponectin, and decreased fat mass, waist circumference, leptin, and resistin. Beneficial modulations in vascular health by LF diets may be mediated by improvements in adipocyte parameters.",

    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with insulin resistance (IR). Prior studies have found that in individuals with CKD, leptin is associated with fat mass but resistin is not and the associations with adiponectin are conflicting. This suggests that the mechanism and factors associated with IR in CKD may differ. Of the 2418 individuals without reported diabetes at baseline, participating in the Health, Aging and Body Composition study, a study in older individuals aged 70-79 years, 15.6% had CKD defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) based on cystatin C. IR was defined as the upper quartile of the homeostasis model assessment. The association of visceral and subcutaneous abdominal fat, percent body fat, muscle fat, lipids, inflammatory markers and adiponectin were tested with logistic regression. Interactions were checked to assess whether the factors associated with IR were different in those with and without CKD. Individuals with IR had a lower eGFR (80.7 &#xb1; 20.9 versus 75.6 &#xb1; 19.6, P &lt; 0.001). After multivariable adjustment, eGFR (odds ratio per 10 mL/min/1.73 m(2) 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.87-0.98) and CKD (1.41, 1.04-1.92) remained independently associated with IR. In individuals with and without CKD, the significant predictors of IR were male sex, black race, higher visceral fat, abdominal subcutaneous fat and triglycerides. In individuals without CKD, IR was associated with lower high-density lipoprotein and current nonsmoking status in multivariate analysis. In contrast, among individuals with CKD, interleukin-6 (IL-6) was independently associated with IR. There was a significant interaction of eGFR with race and IL-6 with a trend for adionectin but no significant interactions with CKD (P &gt; 0.1). In the fully adjusted model, there was a trend for an interaction with adiponectin for eGFR (P = 0.08) and significant for CKD (P = 0.04 ), where adiponectin was associated with IR in those without CKD but not in those with CKD. In mainly Stage 3 CKD, kidney function is associated with IR; except for adiponectin, the correlates of IR are similar in those with and without CKD.",

    "title": "Uraemic sera stimulate lipolysis in human adipocytes: role of perilipin.",
    "abstract": "Although chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance, the exact cause(s) are unknown. Since adipose tissue plays an important role in the development of these complications, we investigated the effect of uraemic sera on human adipocytes in vitro. Cultured human adipocytes were incubated for 48 h with media containing sera from eight CKD Stage 5 patients or four (matched for age, sex and body mass index) healthy controls. Glycerol release (an index of lipolysis) was determined in conditioned media. RNA was isolated from the cells and quantitative polymerase chain reaction of genes involved in lipolysis was performed. In vivo lipolysis was determined by the plasma glycerol/total fat mass (from dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) ratio in 28 CKD patients and 28 matched controls. Incubation with uraemic, but not control, sera resulted in a significant &#x223c;30% increase in spontaneous (basal) lipolysis (P &lt;0.05). Furthermore, uraemic but not control sera induced a selective &#x223c;30% reduction of messenger RNA (mRNA) coding for the lipid-droplet-associated protein perilipin (PLIN) (P &lt;0.05), while mRNA levels of lipases, adipokines and differentiation factors did not differ between the groups after incubation. Also, consistent with our in vitro data, in vivo plasma glycerol/fat mass ratio was significantly elevated in uraemic patients as compared to controls (5.23 &#xb1; 4.1 versus 3.41 &#xb1; 2.3 &#x3bc;M/kg, P &lt; 0.05). Undefined circulating factors in CKD patients increase basal lipolysis in human adipocytes in vitro, probably by attenuating the expression of the lipolytic regulator PLIN. Since in vivo lipolysis is a well-established risk factor for insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease, these effects may promote increased morbidity and mortality in CKD.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin, secreted mainly by mature adipocytes, is a protein with insulin-sensitising and anti-atherogenic effects. Human adiponectin is encoded by the ADIPOQ gene on the chromosomal locus 3q27. Variations in ADIPOQ are associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and related phenotypes in several populations. Our aim was to study the association of the ADIPOQ variations with body weight, serum adiponectin concentrations and conversion to T2DM in overweight subjects with impaired glucose tolerance. Moreover, we investigated whether ADIPOQ gene variants modify the effect of lifestyle changes on these traits. Participants in the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study were randomly assigned to a lifestyle intervention group or a control group. Those whose DNA was available (n = 507) were genotyped for ten ADIPOQ single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Associations between SNPs and baseline body weight and serum adiponectin concentrations were analysed using the univariate analysis of variance. The 4-year longitudinal weight data were analysed using linear mixed models analysis and the change in serum adiponectin from baseline to year four was analysed using Kruskal-Wallis test. In addition, the association of SNPs with the risk of developing T2DM during the follow-up of 0-11 (mean 6.34) years was analysed by Cox regression analysis. rs266729, rs16861205, rs1501299, rs3821799 and rs6773957 associated significantly (p &lt; 0.05) with body weight at baseline and in the longitudinal analyses. The rs266729 C allele and the rare minor alleles of rs2241766 and rs2082940 were associated with an increased adjusted hazard ratio of developing T2DM. The differences in baseline serum adiponectin concentrations were seen according to rs16861210, rs17366568, rs2241766, rs6773957 and rs2082940 and differences in the change of serum adiponectin levels from baseline to the four year examination were seen according to rs16861205, especially in subjects who were able to lose weight during the first year of intervention. These results from the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study support the concept that genetic variation in ADIPOQ locus contributes to variation in body size and serum adiponectin concentrations and may also modify the risk of developing T2DM.

    "abstract": "Postprandial lipemia impairs insulin sensitivity and triggers the pro-inflammatory state which may lead to the progression of cardiovascular diseases. A randomized, crossover single-blind study (n = 10 healthy men) was designed to compare the effects of a high-fat load (50 g fat), rich in palmitic acid from both plant (palm olein) or animal source (lard) versus an oleic acid-rich fat (virgin olive oil) on lipemia, plasma glucose, insulin and adipocytokines. Serum triacylglycerol (TAG) concentrations were significantly lower after the lard meal than after the olive oil and palm olein meals (meal effect P = 0.003; time effect P &lt; 0.001). The greater reduction in the plasma non-esterified free fatty acids levels in the lard group compared to the olive oil meal was mirrored by the changes observed for serum TAG levels (P &lt; 0.05). The magnitude of response for plasma glucose, insulin and adipocytokines [interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1; (TNF-&#x3b1;), interleukin-1&#x3b2; (IL-1&#x3b2;) and leptin] were not altered by the type of dietary fats. A significant difference in plasma IL-1&#x3b2; was found over time following the three high fat loads (time effect P = 0.036). The physical characteristics and changes in TAG structure of lard may contribute to the smaller increase in postprandial lipemia compared with palm olein. A high fat load but not the type of fats influences concentrations of plasma IL-1&#x3b2; over time but had no effect on other pro-inflammatory markers tested in the postprandial state.",

Low-grade inflammation, an independent risk factor for CVD, is modifiable by diet. Subjects with T2D show elevated postprandial inflammatory responses to fat-rich meals, while information on postprandial inflammation in REL is sparse. To clarify whether medium-chain saturated fatty acids (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) have differential acute effects on low-grade inflammation in REL compared to controls (CON). In randomized order, 17 REL and 17 CON ingested two fat-rich meals, with 72 energy percent from MUFA and 79 energy percent from mainly medium-chain SFA, respectively. Plasma high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), adiponectin, and leptin were measured at baseline, 15 min, 60 min, and 240 min postprandially. Muscle and adipose tissue biopsies were taken at baseline and 210 min after the test meal, and expression of selected genes was analyzed. Plasma IL-6 increased (p &lt; 0.001) without difference between REL and CON and between the meals, whereas plasma adiponectin and plasma hs-CRP were unchanged during the 240 min observation period. Plasma leptin decreased slightly in response to medium-chain SFA in both groups, and to MUFA in REL. Several genes were differentially regulated in muscle and adipose tissue of REL and CON. MUFA and medium-chain SFA elicit similar postprandial circulating inflammatory responses in REL and CON. Medium-chain SFA seems more proinflammatory than MUFA, judged by the gene expression in muscle and adipose tissue of REL and CON.",

In order to derive a more precise estimation of the association, a meta-analysis was conducted. Twelve studies with 5,935 cases and 5,959 controls were enrolled by searching the databases of Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane. Summary odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. The heterogeneity and publication bias were investigated. The main analysis indicated no significant association [for allelic model: OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.97 (0.92-1.03); for additive model: OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.95 (0.83-1.09); for recessive model: OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.98 (0.86-1.12); for dominant model: OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.95 (0.88-1.04)]. Overall, no significant heterogeneity was found. Subgroup analysis by race and source of controls indicated no significant association. In conclusion, the current meta-analysis did not observe any association between the polymorphism of RETN -420 C/G and the risk of T2DM. The study may help us further understand the genetics of T2DM.

Study participants, consisting of 897 men aged 61&#xb1;14 (mean&#xb1;standard deviation) years and 1,148 women aged 63&#xb1;12 years, were randomly recruited from a single community at the time of their annual health examination.

    "title": "Effects of pioglitazone and metformin fixed-dose combination therapy on cardiovascular risk markers of inflammation and lipid profile compared with pioglitazone and metformin monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes.",
    "abstract": ". Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treatment should not increase cardiovascular (CV) risk and at best could provide benefit beyond lowering glucose. Pioglitazone has demonstrated a favorable CV profile relative to other oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) in outcome and observational studies. This randomized, double-blind, parallel-group controlled study examined circulating biomarkers of CV risk in T2DM patients receiving a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of pioglitazone/metformin compared with the respective monotherapies. Patients with stable glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c) ) for 3 months taking no OADs were treated with pioglitazone 15mg/metformin 850mg FDC twice daily (bid), pioglitazone 15mg bid, or metformin 850mg bid for 24 weeks. FDC and pioglitazone increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 14.20% and 9.88%, respectively, vs an increase of 6.09% with metformin (P&lt;.05, metformin vs FDC). Triglycerides decreased with all three treatments -5.95%, -5.54% and -1.78%, respectively; P=not significant). FDC and pioglitazone significantly decreased small low-density lipoprotein and increased large low-density lipoprotein particle concentrations. Reductions in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were greater in the FDC and pioglitazone groups. Increases in adiponectin were significant in the FDC and pioglitazone groups (P&lt;.0001 vs metformin). Overall, adverse events were not higher with the FDC. Thus, treatment with the FDC resulted in improved levels of CV biomarkers, which were better than or equal to monotherapy.",

    "title": "Effect of FTO, SH2B1, LEP, and LEPR polymorphisms on weight gain associated with antipsychotic treatment.",
    "abstract": "Weight gain is one of the major adverse effects of antipsychotics. Although mechanisms remain unclear, genetic susceptibility has become increasingly attractive as a potential mechanism that could explain a significant part of interindividual variability. Most investigations have explored genes related with the mechanism of action of antipsychotic drugs. An alternative approach to investigate the role that genetic factors play in weight gain secondary to antipsychotic treatment is to study those genetic variants that have been found associated with obesity. The aim of this study was to determine whether the fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO) rs9939609 variant, the single nucleotide polymorphism that has shown the strongest association with common obesity in different populations, influences weight gain during the first year of antipsychotic treatment. We investigated also the genetic variants in other 3 strong candidates genes involved in the leptin-signaling pathway including leptin, leptin receptor, and Src homology 2. We carried out a prospective study on 239 patients with first-episode psychosis. Two hundred five patients completed the follow-up at 1 year (85.8%). Before antipsychotic treatment, the homozygous subjects for the risk allele A of the FTOrs9939609 variant had a higher body mass index at baseline (24.2 T 3.8 kg/m&#xb2;) than the AT/TT group (22.82 T 3.3 kg/m2; F = 5.744; P = 0.018). After 1 year, the magnitude of weight increase was similar in the 3 genotypes defined by the rs9939609 variant. These results suggest that the pharmacological intervention accompanied by changes in energy intake and expenditure could suppress the genetic susceptibility conferred by the FTO genotype. None of the other single nucleotide polymorphisms evaluated were associated with weight gain during the first 12 months of antipsychotic therapy.",

    "abstract": "Women who are unable to return to a healthy weight by 6 months postpartum increase their risk factors for the development of chronic disease (CD; including metabolic syndrome, obesity, and cardiovascular disease). In a prospective randomized intervention study, we examined the effect of exercise intensity on risk factors for CD in the postpartum. We hypothesized that women receiving an intervention targeting healthy weight loss would have improved CD risk factors compared with women not receiving the intervention. Further, we hypothesized that nutrition control and moderate-intensity exercise would have the greatest improvement in CD risk factors versus low-intensity exercise. Women were randomly assigned to a nutrition plus low-intensity (30% HR reserve; n = 20) or moderate-intensity (70% HR reserve; n = 20) exercise intervention group. The program consisted of supervised walking for 45 min, three to four times per week for 16 wk. All women were screened for CD at the beginning (7-8 wk postpartum) and at the end (23-25 wk postpartum) of the study. A historical control group of 20 sedentary postpartum women was matched by body mass index, age, and parity. The low- and moderate-intensity groups lost more body mass (-4.2 &#xb1; 4.0 and -5.0 &#xb1; 2.9 kg, respectively) compared with the control group (-0.1 &#xb1; 3.3 kg, P &lt; 0.01). Plasma low-density lipoprotein was reduced for the low- and moderate-intensity groups (-0.29 &#xb1; 0.21 and -0.28 &#xb1; 0.17 mmol &#xb7; L) compared with the control group (0.03 &#xb1; 0.18 mmol &#xb7; L, P = 0.015). In addition, glucose concentrations were reduced and adiponectin concentrations increased (P = 0.037), regardless of exercise intensity, although the sedentary controls remained unchanged or at increased risk for CD. Women receiving a postpartum intervention targeting healthy weight loss, regardless of exercise intensity, improved CD risk factors compared with women not receiving the intervention.",

    "title": "Sixteen weeks of exercise reduces C-reactive protein levels in young women.",
    "abstract": "Regular exercise has been shown to protect against breast cancer risk, and one possible mechanism is through a reduction in inflammation. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of 16 wk of aerobic exercise training on adipokines and inflammatory markers in healthy young women. Participants were 319 sedentary women aged 18-30 yr, with body mass index of 18-40 kg &#xb7; m, randomized to an exercise intervention or no exercise for approximately 16 wk. Adiponectin, leptin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and amyloid A (AA) were measured at baseline and after 16 wk. Adiponectin was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and AA, CRP, and leptin were measured by multiplex bead array assays. Exercise significantly decreased CRP levels in the exercise group compared with the control group (-1.41 mg &#xb7; L in exercisers vs -0.005 mg &#xb7; L in controls, P = 0.040), and this effect was largely driven by changes in CRP that occurred in the obese exercisers. There was no effect of exercise on levels of SAA, adiponectin, or leptin. There was also no effect of exercise on stress and depression scores. Neither change in percent body fat nor change in fitness influenced the effects of exercise on these inflammatory markers. This study demonstrated that a 16-wk aerobic exercise program significantly decreased levels of CRP in young women, especially in those who were obese. There was no evidence that this effect was mediated by changes in perceived stress, percent body fat, or fitness. These findings suggest that adopting an exercise routine early in life may decrease future risk of breast cancer and other chronic diseases in obese women.",

Our objective was to evaluate the effects of 1-year treatment with sibutramine compared to placebo on body weight, glycaemic control, lipid profile, and inflammatory parameters in type 2 diabetic patients. Two hundred and forty-six patients with uncontrolled T2DM [glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c) ) &gt; 8&#xb7;0%] in therapy with different oral hypoglycaemic agents or insulin were randomized to take 10 mg of sibutramine or placebo for 12 months.

We observed a decrease of body weight after 9 and 12 months in the group treated with sibutramine, but not in the control group. Regarding glycaemic and lipid profile, although there are differences seen over time within each of the groups, we did not obtain any significant differences between the two groups. Both placebo and sibutramine gave a similar improvement of HOMA-IR, leptin, TNF-&#x3b1;, ADN, and Hs-CRP. No vaspin variations were observed in either group. Sibutramine resulted in a decrease in body weight at 9 months and at 12 months that was not observed with placebo. Although there were differences seen over time within each of the groups, there were no significant differences between groups for any other parameter that we measured.",

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the serum total adiponectin levels in patients with simple nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), those with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and controls. Data were extracted from PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials electronic databases (up to December 2009). The main outcome was the weighted mean differences (WMDs) in adiponectin between comparison groups. Twenty-eight studies were included in the systematic review. A meta-analysis of 27 studies that reported data on 2243 subjects (698 controls and 1545 patients with NAFLD) was performed. Controls had higher serum adiponectin compared with NAFL patients (12 studies, random-effects WMD [95% confidence interval {CI}] = 3.00 [1.57-4.43], I&#xb2; = 80.4%) or NASH patients (19 studies, random-effects WMD [95% CI] = 4.75 [3.71-5.78], I&#xb2; = 84.1%). The NASH patients demonstrated lower adiponectin compared with NAFL patients (19 studies, random-effects WMD [95% CI] = 1.81 [1.09-2.53], I&#xb2; = 71.7%). By performing a meta-regression analysis, body mass index, age, sex, and type 2 diabetes mellitus failed to account for heterogeneity. However, the performance of liver biopsy on controls had significant effect on the outcome and accounted for 76.7%, 85.5%, and 22.8% of the between-study variance for comparisons between controls vs NAFLD, NAFL, and NASH patients, respectively. Based on liver histology, serum adiponectin levels are similar in NAFL patients and controls, but hypoadiponectinemia may play an important pathophysiological role in the progression from NAFL to NASH.",

    "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with changes in body composition and bone mineral density (BMD). The purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether anti-TNF treatment in early RA has an impact on body composition and BMD besides that which could be achieved by intensive disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) combination therapy. Forty patients with early RA who failed treatment with methotrexate up to 20 mg/week for 3 months were randomised to addition of sulphasalazine and hydroxychloroquine (treatment A) or addition of infliximab (treatment B). At 3, 12 and 24 months, body composition and BMD were assessed by total-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. At the same time points, leptin, adiponectin, apolipoproteins, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and markers of bone remodelling were analysed. Compliance to treatment was considered in the analyses. Data were analysed with a mixed, linear model. Patients treated with anti-TNF had a significant increase in fat mass at 2 years, 3.8 (1.6 to 5.9) kg, in contrast to patients in treatment A, 0.4 (-1.5 to 2.2) kg (P = 0.040), despite similar reduction in disease activity. Both treatment strategies prevented loss of muscle mass and bone. Leptin concentrations increased significantly in both groups at 2 years and adiponectin increased significantly at 2 years in treatment A and at 1 year in treatment B. There were no significant changes in apolipoproteins or IGF-1. The markers of bone resorption decreased at 12 months in both treatment groups with no significant difference between the treatment groups. Infliximab therapy increased body fat mass, an effect that was not achieved with the combination of DMARDs, despite a similar reduction in disease activity, and thus seemed to be drug specific. The increase of fat mass was not associated with an exacerbated atherogenic lipid profile. Leptin and adiponectin concentrations increased in both treatment groups. The increase of adiponectin may partially explain the reduced frequency of cardiovascular diseases found when disease activity is reduced in RA. ISRCTN39045408.",

Periodontal intervention is helpful for glucose control, which may be associated with increased serum adiponectin levels and decreased inflammatory cytokine levels.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to examine the influence of exercise training on leptin levels in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). Sixty-four male patients, mean age 55.6 &#xb1; 6.0 years, were randomized either to six weeks of aerobic training, three times a week, at 60-80% of maximal heart rate (training group, Ex, n = 32) or to a control group (n = 32). Exercise stress test was performed and body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), waist circumference and plasma leptin levels were measured at the beginning and end of the study. Physical capacity increased significantly only in Ex patients (max workload in METs from 7.7 &#xb1; 1.4 to 8.2 &#xb1; 1.4, p &lt; 0.05). There were no significant differences between initial and final results in either group in terms of BMI, WHR or waist circumference. Although, at the end of the study, leptin levels did not change in Ex patients (6.7 &#xb1; 3.2 vs 6.9 &#xb1; 3.6 ng/mL, NS), they did increase significantly in the control group (8.0 &#xb1; 4.0 vs 9.3 &#xb1; 5.2 ng/mL, p &lt; 0.02). A short period of exercise training in CAD patients improved their physical capacity, but did not influence BMI, WHR and waist circumference. Exercise training prevented an increase in leptin levels during the study period.",

    "abstract": "Statins and fibrates alter lipids, apolipoproteins and inflammatory markers in persons without HIV. The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in lipoproteins, apolipoproteins and other markers of inflammation with the use of pravastatin and fenofibrate. Evaluation of participants in ACTG A5087, a randomized trial of pravastatin 40 mg/day or fenofibrate 200 mg/day for the treatment of dyslipidemia. Participants that failed single-agent therapy at week 12 were given the combination. Participants with available specimens were tested for apolipoproteins A1 and B, adiponectin, plasminogen-activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1), P-selectin, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). 74 participants (37 per randomized arm) received either pravastatin or fenofibrate for 12 weeks with 60 receiving combination treatment from weeks 12-48. There were no significant changes in hs-CRP, PAI-1, and P-selectin. From baseline to week 12, the median Apo B levels (-8 mg/dL, P=0.01 for fenofibrate and -27 mg/dL, P&lt;0.01 for pravastatin) and ApoB/A1 ratios (-0.16, P&lt;0.01 for both arms) significantly decreased. From baseline to week 48, median adiponectin (-1 ng/dL, P&lt;0.01), Apo B (-22 mg/dL, P&lt;0.01) and Apo B/A1 ratios (-0.2, P&lt;0.01) all decreased in those who went on combination therapy, whereas Apo A1 (9.5 mg/dL, P=0.01) levels increased. Treatment with pravastatin or fenofibrate improves the atherogenic lipid profile within the first 12 weeks and is sustained through 48 weeks with combination therapy. Adiponectin levels decrease with lipid-lowering therapy. However, markers of inflammation and platelet activation were not appreciably changed suggesting that the biologic properties of these agents differ in persons with HIV infection.",

    "title": "Mechanisms of adiponectin regulation and use as a pharmacological target.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin is an insulin-sensitizing and anti-inflammatory fat cell hormone that has immense potential as a therapeutic target for a multitude of obesity-associated diseases, including type 2 diabetes, NASH and atherosclerosis (Chandran M, Phillips SA, Ciaraldi T, Henry RR: Adiponectin: more than just another fat cell hormone?Diabetes Care 2003, 26:2442-2450). The adiponectin gene is located in chromosome 3q27, a susceptibility locus for T2DM and metabolic disorders (Saito K, Tobe T, Minoshima S, Asakawa S, Sumiya J, Yoda M, Nakano Y, Shimizu N, Tomita M: Organization of the gene for gelatin-binding protein (GBP28). Gene 1999, 229:67-73). Increased circulating levels of adiponectin are associated with improvement in the metabolic syndrome and reductions are strongly predictive of diabetes risk (Li S, Shin HJ, Ding EL, van Dam RM: Adiponectin levels and risk of type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis. JAMA 2009, 302:179-188. Extensive efforts have been made to understand how adiponectin levels can be elevated. The complex post-translational processing and secretion of adiponectin provides a rich area where pharmacologic manipulation may be developed to increase adiponectin levels in humans. Circulating adiponectin levels are increased by many commonly used drugs, such as statins, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones (TZDs) providing an important opportunity to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying their effects. This review describes the cellular processes by which adiponectin is synthesized and secreted, current therapeutics known to affect this pathway and the potential for therapeutic manipulation in human subjects.",

    "abstract": "During the proteomic era, one of the most rapidly growing areas in biomedical research is biomarker discovery, particularly using proteomic technologies. The urinary proteome is known to be a valuable field of study and has become one of the most attractive subdisciplines in clinical proteomics for human diseases. We have described the levels of protein biomarkers specific to diabetes mellitus type 2 in the Pakistani population using proteomic technology. One hundred type 2 diabetes patients with 50 age- and sex-matched normal healthy controls were recruited from Sheikh Zayed Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan. Urinary proteins were analyzed by two-dimensional liquid chromatography, using chromatofocusing in the first dimension and reverse-phase chromatography in the second, followed by mass spectrometric analysis. Levels of the proteins, which were found to vary in the diabetes type 2 patients compared to the controls, were then determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in all the samples. Levels of transthyretin, &#x3b1;-1-microglobulin/bikunin precursor, and haptoglobin precursor decreased by 30.8%, 55.2%, and 81.45%, whereas levels of albumin, zinc &#x3b1;2 glycoprotein, retinol binding protein 4, and E-cadherin increased by 486.5%, 29.23%, 100%, and 693%, respectively, in the diabetes patients compared to the controls. Variation in the levels of these identified protein biomarkers have been reported in other pathological states. Assessment of the levels of these biomarkers will be helpful not only in early diagnosis but also in prognosis of diabetes mellitus type 2.",

    "abstract": "Population studies have consistently found that shorter sleep durations are associated with obesity and cardiovascular disease, particularly among women. Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived, anti-inflammatory hormone that is related to cardiovascular disease risk. We hypothesized that sleep restriction would reduce adiponectin levels in healthy young adults. 74 healthy adults (57% men, 63% African American, mean age 29.9years) completed 2 nights of baseline sleep at 10h time in bed (TIB) per night followed by 5 nights of sleep restricted to 4h TIB per night. An additional 8 participants were randomized to a control group that received 10h TIB per night throughout the study. Plasma adiponectin levels were measured following the second night of baseline sleep and the fifth night of sleep restriction or control sleep. Sleep restriction resulted in a decrease in plasma adiponectin levels among Caucasian women (Z=-2.19, p=0.028), but an increase among African American women (Z=-2.73, p=0.006). No significant effects of sleep restriction on adiponectin levels were found among men. A 2&#xd7;2 between-group analysis of covariance on adiponectin change scores controlling for BMI confirmed significant interactions between sleep restriction and race/ethnicity [F(1,66)=13.73, p&lt;0.001], as well as among sleep restriction, race/ethnicity and sex [F(1,66)=4.27, p=0.043)]. Inflammatory responses to sleep loss appear to be moderated by sex and race/ethnicity; observed decreases in adiponectin following sleep restriction may be one avenue by which reduced sleep duration promotes cardiovascular risk in Caucasian women.",

    "abstract": "The Japan assessment of pitavastatin and atorvastatin in acute coronary syndrome (JAPAN-ACS) study demonstrated that aggressive lipid-lowering therapy with a statin resulted in a significant regression of coronary atherosclerotic plaques in patients with ACS. Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived protein with anti-atherogenic properties. Here, we investigated the association between adiponectin levels and the change in the plaque volume in ACS patients. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was undertaken, followed by the initiation of statin treatment, in 238 patients with ACS. Follow-up IVUS was performed between 8 and 12 months after the PCI. The percent change in the plaque volume (%PV) in a non-culprit coronary artery segment was evaluated. The serum adiponectin and lipid parameters were measured both at baseline and at the follow-up. At baseline, adiponectin was correlated positively with HDL-cholesterol and negatively correlated with triglyceride, but no correlation was observed with the PV. Adiponectin levels increased significantly from 7.8+/-4.6 microg/mL at baseline to 10.3+/-6.9 microg/mL at the 8-12 months follow-up. The increase in adiponectin was also associated with an increase of HDL-cholesterol and decrease of triglyceride, however, no significant correlation was observed with the %PV. A significantly higher incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) was observed in patients with hypo-adiponectinemia at baseline. A multiple logistic regression analysis identified adiponectin as a significant independent predictor of MACE. Adiponectin levels measured after PCI could serve as a marker of MACE in patients with ACS.",

This study aimed to evaluate, during energy restriction, the effects of a high-calcium diet (HCD) on measures of abdominal obesity and cardiometabolic risk factors in Brazilian obese subjects of multiethnic origin. We conducted a randomised clinical trial. Fifty obese subjects of both sexes, aged 22-55 years, with stable body weight and a low calcium intake were randomised into the following outpatient dietary regimens: (i) a low-calcium diet (LCD; &lt; 500 mg/day) or (ii) a HCD [1200-1300 mg/day, supplemented with non-fat powdered milk (60 g/day)]. Both groups followed an energy-restricted diet (-800 kcal/day) throughout the study (16 weeks). Thirty-nine participants completed the study. After 16 weeks of energy restriction, a significant reduction was observed in all anthropometric parameters, metabolic variables (except for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) and blood pressure levels in both the groups. Insulin was significantly reduced only in the HCD group. Subjects on the HCD compared with those on the LCD exhibited a greater reduction in waist circumference (p = 0.002), waist-to-hip ratio (p = 0.0001), diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.04) and mean blood pressure (p = 0.03). Our study suggests that increased calcium intake may enhance the beneficial effects of energy restriction on abdominal obesity and blood pressure.",

The present meta-analysis was performed to clarify the role of polymorphisms in proximal promoter region of ADIPOQ (rs17360539 and rs266729) in type 2 diabetes. The MEDLINE, EMBASE and Science Citation Index Expanded database were searched for eligible studies. Odd ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of association. The pooled ORs were performed for per-allele model (A/a) and others genetic models. A total of 10267 T2DM patients and 12837 controls was included in the meta-analysis. Overall the -11377G allele had an 8% elevated risk of T2DM compared to -11377C allele in all subjects (P=0.034, OR=1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.15). The -11391A allele showed no significant effect on T2DM risk in all subjects (P=0.240, OR=1.10, 95% CI 0.94-1.29) compared to -11391G allele. In the subgroup analyses by ethnicity, -11391A allele increased T2DM risk in European population (P=0.046, OR=1.09, 95% CI 1.00-1.09). In conclusion, the accumulated evidence suggested that the ADIPOQ -11377G allele is a low-penetrant risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes, but -11391A is a risk factor only in European Caucasians.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to assess the effect of long-term pioglitazone treatment on erythropoietin responsiveness and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic patients on hemodialysis. We conducted a prospective, open-label, parallel-group, controlled study of 63 type 2 diabetic hemodialysis patients who were randomly assigned to two groups: pioglitazone group (P-group; 15-30 mg/day pioglitazone plus conventional oral hypoglycemic agents) and control group (C-group; conventional oral hypoglycemic agents alone). We determined the efficacy of pioglitazone by monitoring anemia, glycemic control, insulin resistance, and levels of inflammatory cytokines and high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin for 96 weeks. Pioglitazone effectively reduced erythropoietin dose and maintained the target hemoglobin levels by improving insulin resistance up to the end of the study. In the P-group, hemoglobin A(1c), glycated albumin, and triglycerides significantly decreased compared with the C-group. There was a significant reduction in homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance and the level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and a significant increase in HMW adiponectin level in the P-group; these changes were significantly different compared with values for the C-group. No serious adverse effects such as hypoglycemia, liver impairment, or heart failure were observed in any of the patients. Pioglitazone treatment resulted in better glycemic control, improved lipid levels, an increase in insulin sensitivity and adiponectin levels, and a decrease in inflammatory markers, thus improving the risk factors of cardiovascular disease. Erythropoietin responsiveness improved with a reduction in erythropoietin dose and may be associated with the improvement in insulin resistance due to long-term pioglitazone treatment.",

    "abstract": "The aims of present study were 1) to evaluate cardiac valve characteristics, 2) to determine the plasma concentrations of fibrinogen, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), adiponectin, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in the obese women before and after 19 months sibutramine treatment in the obese women. Sixty obese women were enrolled in this prospective, randomized study. Thirty women received 10 mg once daily dose of sibutramine for 19 months. The rest of the obese women received 15 mg once daily dose of sibutramine for 19 months. All patients were evaluated with echocardiography. Plasma levels of adiponectin and TNF-alpha were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and hsCRP by immunoturbimetric assay. Student paired and unpaired t tests were used to compare the 10 mg or 15 mg dose sibutramine effects either in groups or between the groups. There were no signs of significant regurgitation or thickening of the mitral and aortic valves on echocardiographic evaluation performed after 19 months of treatment. Parameters of systolic function after 10 or 15 mg treatment were not different from pretreatment characteristics. Minimal tricuspid regurgitation was found in one (1/27) patient treated with 10 mg sibutramine after 19 months. Among obese patients treated with 15 mg sibutramine one patient (1/28) had minimal mitral valve regurgitation and 2 patients (2/28) had minimal aortic insufficiency. Stage II diastolic dysfunction in the 15 obese treated with 15 mg regressed to stage I diastolic dysfunction (50%). Stage II diastolic dysfunction in the 10 obese treated with 10 mg regressed to stage I diastolic dysfunction (33.3%). Mean levels of TNF-alpha(p=0.04), fibrinogen (p=0.03) and hsCRP (p=0.04)i decreased and adiponectin (p=0.03) levels increased in the obese treated with 10 mg sibutramine. Likewise, in the patients treated with 15 mg sibutramine, mean levels of TNF- alpha(p=0.01), fibrinogen (p= 0.02), and hsCRP (p= 0.04) decreased and adiponectin (p= 0.02) levels increased. Nineteen months of sibutramine treatment does not affect heart valve and systolic functions, however, diastolic dysfunction severity reduced with sibutramine treatment. Also In addition, mean levels of adiponectin, TNF- alpha, fibrinogen and hs- CRP change with 19 months sibutramine treatment.",

    "abstract": "Elucidating potential pathways that micronutrients may reduce/promote chronic disease may contribute to our understanding of the underlying etiology of disease and their utility as markers of risk. In the current study, we examined associations of serum lipid-soluble micronutrients with body mass index (BMI). We hypothesized that obesity may differentially influence serum micronutrient levels, thereby affecting risk for chronic disease incidence and mortality. Baseline serum samples from 180 premenopausal women from a nutritional trial were analyzed for leptin, C-reactive protein, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, carotenoids, and tocopherols. Participants were stratified into normal-weight (18.5-24.9), overweight (25-29.9), and obese (&gt;or=30) subgroups by BMI (in kilograms per square meter). Differences in serum biomarkers among BMI subgroups were adjusted for Asian ethnicity and smoking status. As expected, obese individuals had significantly higher serum levels of leptin and C-reactive protein (Ps &lt; .05) compared with normal-weight women. gamma-Tocopherol levels were significantly higher in obese individuals (P &lt; .05), whereas alpha-tocopherol levels did not differ among BMI subgroups. Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and carotenoids (except lycopene) were significantly lower in obese than in normal-weight women (Ps &lt; .05). The associations between BMI and carotenoids were independent of dietary intake. The obesity-associated reduction for total provitamin A carotenoids (45%) was approximately 3-fold greater than that observed for non-provitamin A carotenoids (16%). Our results indicate potential influences of obesity on serum levels of lipid-soluble micronutrients and suggest that metabolism of provitamin A carotenoids may contribute to the differences observed.",

    "abstract": "The effects of exercise intervention and to assess its long-term efficacy in preventing subsequent cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes were little known on randomized controlled trial. Thirty-eight type 2 diabetic patients (21 men and 17 women) were assigned to either the exercise group (n=21) or the control group without exercise training (n=17) by simple randomization. The exercise training group was scheduled for aerobic and resistance exercise programs for 3 months. After the 3-month, we investigated endothelial function, insulin resistance, adipocytokines and inflammatory markers. The endothelial function was evaluated by examining a flow-mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilatation (FMD). Furthermore, we followed the incidence of cardiovascular events for 24 months. After 3-month, HbA1C was decreased significantly in both groups. FMD was increased from 7.3+/-4.7% to 10.9+/-6.2% only in the exercise group (p&lt;0.05). Long-term follow-up data showed that the control group developed cardiovascular events more frequently than did the exercise group (p&lt;0.05). Exercise improves endothelial dysfunction independently of glycemic control and insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes. The beneficial effects of 3-month exercise to reduce cardiovascular events persist for 24 months.",

The aim of our preliminary study was to evaluate the effectiveness of long-term consumption of food enriched with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in patients with NAFLD. Eleven patients were enrolled; six (four males, two females) were planned for oral administration of 6.5 ml olive oil enriched with n-3 PUFA for 12 months, while five (four males, one female) were used as controls. Consumption of olive oil enriched with n-3 PUFA demonstrated a significant improvement of liver echo-texture and of the Doppler Perfusion Index after 12 months (after: 0.19 &#xb1; 0.02 vs. pre: 0.15 &#xb1; 0.03; P &lt; 0.05), whereas no significant changes were seen at the end of follow-up in controls.

These changes were statistically independent of the change in total body fat mass and body weight. Exenatide treatment for 1 year reduced body fat mass and improved the profile of circulating biomarkers of cardiovascular risk.

    "abstract": "Statins are extensively used for lowering LDL-cholesterol and reducing cardiovascular events. Recent studies have shown that statins have beneficial anti-inflammatory effects. We aimed to determine whether and how adipokines are regulated during statin treatment in type 2 diabetic patients. In this study,we investigated the changes of CRP and inflammation-related adipokines (SAA,IL-6,TNFalpha and adiponectin) in 23 type 2 diabetic patients with atherosclerosis who received statin therapy, and 20 diabetic patients with atherosclerosis and 14 diabetic patients without atherosclerosis who did not receive statin therapy for a period of three months. By the end of the simvastatin treatment (40 mg, daily), LDL-cholesterol was decreased by 16.7% and HDL-cholesterol was increased by 31.9%. SAA, CRP, TNFalpha and IL-6 levels were decreased by 31.8%, 66.2%, 53.9% and 14%, respectively and adiponectin was increased by 59.6%, compared with the baseline levels. Interestingly, the decrease of SAA was positively correlated with that of LDL-cholesterol but negatively with HDL-cholesterol during statin treatment. Among the adipokines, the decrease of SAA was positively correlated with TNFalpha (r = 0.50, p = 0.016). The results suggest that adipokines may be differentially regulated and independent of cholesterol changes and that adipokines may be a mediator, and the adipose tissue may be a target of statins' anti-inflammatory effect.",

    "abstract": "Adipocytokine, including leptin and adiponectin, may play an important role in the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis (OA). Spa therapy is one of the most commonly used non-pharmacological approaches for OA, but its mechanisms of action are not completely known. The aim of the present study was to assess whether spa therapy modified plasma levels of leptin and adiponectin in thirty patients with knee OA treated with a cycle of a combination of daily locally applied mud-packs and bicarbonate-sulphate mineral bath water. Leptin and adiponectin plasma levels were assessed at baseline and after 2 weeks, upon completion of the spa treatment period. The concentrations of leptin and adiponectin were measured by ELISA. At basal time, plasma leptin levels were significantly correlated with body mass index (BMI) and gender, but no significant correlation was found with patient age, duration of disease, radiographic severity of knee OA, VAS score or Lequesne index. There was no correlation between plasma adiponectin level and BMI, gender and age, duration of the disease, radiographic severity of knee OA and VAS score. A significant correlation of plasma adiponectin levels was found only with the Lequesne index. At the end of the mud-bath therapy cycle, serum leptin levels showed a slight but not significant increase, while a significant decrease (P &lt; 0.05) in serum adiponectin levels was found. However, leptin and adiponectin concentrations after treatment were not correlated with other clinical parameters. In conclusion, our data show that spa therapy can modify plasma levels of the adipocytokines leptin and adiponectin, important mediators of cartilage metabolism. Whether this effect may play a potential role in OA needs further investigations.",

    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is commonly associated with obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes, and can thus be regarded as the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. In this study we compared the effects of lifestyle intervention with and without industrial berry products, on risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome on slightly overweight women. Sixty-one female volunteers (average age 42.9 years) were recruited and randomized for a 20-week dietary intervention trial with two parallel treatment groups, one lifestyle intervention group with berry products equaling with an average daily dose of 163 g of northern berries (berry group, diet 1, N=31, of which 28 completed the study) and the other group with lifestyle intervention only (control group, diet 2, N=30, of which 22 completed the study). Increased berry consumption as part of the normal daily diet was the only lifestyle difference between the two intervention groups. The major effects achieved by diet 1 were changes in the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and adiponectin (at P-values &lt;0.001 and 0.002, respectively). A statistically significant difference between the two intervention groups was the higher decrease in the ALAT value in the berry group (P=0.003). The 23% decrease in the ALAT value, from 20.29 to 15.66 U/l in the berry group may be regarded as nutritionally significant by enhancing the liver function. This may contribute positively to the low-grade systemic inflammation in body and decrease the risk of cardiovascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is highly prevalent in obese and type 2 diabetic individuals and is strongly associated with dyslipidemia and inflammation. Weight loss and/or pharmacotherapy are commonly used to correct these abnormalities. We performed a 16-week intervention trial of a hypocaloric, low-fat diet plus 10 mg/day ezetimibe (n = 15) versus a hypocaloric, low-fat diet alone (n = 10) on intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) content, plasma high sensitivity-C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), adipocytokines, and fetuin-A concentrations and apolipoprotein (apo)B-100 kinetics in obese subjects. ApoB-100 metabolism was assessed using stable isotope tracer kinetics and compartmental modeling; liver and abdominal fat contents were determined by magnetic resonance techniques. Both weight loss and ezetimibe plus weight loss significantly (all P &lt; 0.05) reduced body weight, visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues, insulin resistance and plasma triglycerides, VLDL-apoB-100, apoC-III, fetuin-A, and retinol-binding protein-4 and increased plasma adiponectin concentrations. Compared with weight loss alone, ezetimibe plus weight loss significantly (all P &lt; 0.05) decreased IHTG content (-18%), plasma hs-CRP (-53%), interleukin-6 (-24%), LDL cholesterol (-18%), campesterol (-59%), and apoB-100 (-14%) levels, with a significant increase in plasma lathosterol concentrations (+43%). The LDL-apoB-100 concentration also significantly fell with ezetimibe plus weight loss (-12%), chiefly owing to an increase in the corresponding fractional catabolic rate (+29%). The VLDL-apoB-100 secretion rate fell with both interventions, with no significant independent effect of ezetimibe. Addition of ezetimibe to a moderate weight loss diet in obese subjects can significantly improve hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and LDL-apoB-100 metabolism.",

It was hypothesized that specific dietary components are able to reduce low-grade inflammation as well as metabolic and oxidative stress. Dietary products [resveratrol, green tea extract, alpha-tocopherol, vitamin C, n-3 (omega-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids, and tomato extract] selected for their evidence-based antiinflammatory properties were combined and given as supplements to 36 healthy overweight men with mildly elevated plasma C-reactive protein concentrations in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study with treatment periods of 5 wk. Inflammatory and oxidative stress defense markers were quantified in plasma and urine. Furthermore, 120 plasma proteins, 274 plasma metabolites (lipids, free fatty acids, and polar compounds), and the transcriptomes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and adipose tissue were quantified. Plasma adiponectin concentrations increased by 7%, whereas C-reactive protein (principal inflammation marker) was unchanged. However, a multitude of subtle changes were detected by an integrated analysis of the omics data, which indicated modulated inflammation of adipose tissue, improved endothelial function, affected oxidative stress, and increased liver fatty acid oxidation. An intervention with selected dietary products affected inflammatory processes, oxidative stress, and metabolism in humans, as shown by large-scale profiling of genes, proteins, and metabolites in plasma, urine, and adipose tissue.

Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Outpatient general clinical research center. Thirty-two nondiabetic men and women with a clinical diagnosis of metabolic syndrome (as defined in the American Heart Association-National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute scientific statement). Patients were randomly assigned to receive either oral rosiglitazone 4 mg/day or matching placebo for 12 weeks. The primary end point was change in serum adiponectin concentrations from baseline to week 12. Secondary end points were changes in serum resistin concentrations, insulin resistance, fasting glucose level, fasting insulin level, body weight, lipid levels, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and waist circumference from baseline to week 12. Also, changes from baseline in adiponectin and resistin concentrations and insulin resistance were assessed over time at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. Rosiglitazone was associated with a significant increase in serum adiponectin concentration after 12 weeks compared with placebo (45.8% vs 2.6%, p=0.002). The increase in adiponectin concentration occurred quickly, with a significant difference observed after 2 weeks of therapy. Compared with placebo, rosiglitazone was not associated with significant 12-week changes in serum resistin concentrations, insulin resistance, fasting glucose level, fasting insulin level, body weight, lipid levels, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, or waist circumference. Rosiglitazone had beneficial effects on adiponectin concentrations without significantly affecting other components of the metabolic syndrome phenotype. Additional studies that further elucidate the time course of thiazolidinedione pharmacodynamic effects, along with their effects on cardiovascular end points, are warranted in nondiabetic patients with metabolic syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Hyperinsulinemia and obesity-related metabolic disturbances are common and have been associated with increased cancer risk and poor prognosis. To investigate this issue in relation to prostate cancer, we conducted a nested case-control study within the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT), a randomized, placebo-controlled trial testing finasteride versus placebo for primary prevention of prostate cancer. Cases (n = 1,803) and controls (n = 1,797) were matched on age, PCPT treatment arm, and family history of prostate cancer; controls included all eligible non-whites. Baseline bloods were assayed for serum C-peptide (marker of insulin secretion) and leptin (an adipokine) using ELISA. All outcomes were biopsy determined. Logistic regression calculated odds ratios (OR) for total prostate cancer and polytomous logistic regression calculated ORs for low-grade (Gleason &lt;7) and high-grade (Gleason &gt;7) disease. Results were stratified by PCPT treatment arm for C-peptide. For men on placebo, higher versus lower serum C-peptide was associated with a nearly 2-fold increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer (Gleason &gt;7; multivariate-adjusted OR, 1.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-2.97; P(trend) = 0.004). When C-peptide was modeled as a continuous variable, every unit increase in log(C-peptide) resulted in a 39% increased risk of high-grade disease (P = 0.01). In contrast, there was no significant relationship between C-peptide and high-grade prostate cancer among men receiving finasteride. Leptin was not independently associated with high-grade prostate cancer. In conclusion, these results support findings from other observational studies that high serum C-peptide and insulin resistance, but not leptin, are associated with increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer. Our novel finding is that the C-peptide-associated risk was attenuated by use of finasteride.",

    "title": "Weight loss in individuals with metabolic syndrome given DASH diet counseling when provided a low sodium vegetable juice: a randomized controlled trial.",
    "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome, a constellation of metabolic risk factors for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, is one of the fastest growing disease entities in the world. Weight loss is thought to be a key to improving all aspects of metabolic syndrome. Research studies have suggested benefits from diets rich in vegetables and fruits in helping individuals reach and achieve healthy weights. To evaluate the effects of a ready to serve vegetable juice as part of a calorie-appropriate Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet in an ethnically diverse population of people with Metabolic Syndrome on weight loss and their ability to meet vegetable intake recommendations, and on their clinical characteristics of metabolic syndrome (waist circumference, triglycerides, HDL, fasting blood glucose and blood pressure).A secondary goal was to examine the impact of the vegetable juice on associated parameters, including leptin, vascular adhesion markers, and markers of the oxidative defense system and of oxidative stress. A prospective 12 week, 3 group (0, 8, or 16 fluid ounces of low sodium vegetable juice) parallel arm randomized controlled trial. Participants were requested to limit their calorie intake to 1600 kcals for women and 1800 kcals for men and were educated on the DASH diet. A total of 81 (22 men &amp; 59 women) participants with Metabolic Syndrome were enrolled into the study. Dietary nutrient and vegetable intake, weight, height, leptin, metabolic syndrome clinical characteristics and related markers of endothelial and cardiovascular health were measured at baseline, 6-, and 12-weeks. There were significant group by time interactions when aggregating both groups consuming vegetable juice (8 or 16 fluid ounces daily). Those consuming juice lost more weight, consumed more Vitamin C, potassium, and dietary vegetables than individuals who were in the group that only received diet counseling (p &lt; 0.05). The incorporation of vegetable juice into the daily diet can be a simple and effective way to increase the number of daily vegetable servings. Data from this study also suggest the potential of using a low sodium vegetable juice in conjunction with a calorie restricted diet to aid in weight loss in overweight individuals with metabolic syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin and leptin are adipocytokines associated with insulin resistance. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the adiponectin-leptin ratio as a measure of insulin resistance in comparison with other surrogate measures of insulin resistance based on fasting insulin and glucose levels [homeostasis model assessment (HOMA), quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), fasting glucose/insulin ratio] and with measures based on fasting insulin and triglyceride levels (McAuley index) in Caucasian patients with Type 2 diabetes (T2D). In 70 patients included in DEMAND (delapril and manidipine for nephroprotection in diabetes) study, fasting samples of plasma insulin and adiponectin were determined by a radioimmunoassay, whereas plasma leptin was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Insulin resistance estimates were derived by the established equations and compared with the direct measurement of insulin resistance obtained with the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. Insulin resistance estimates and the clamp derived sensitivity index were compared by correlation analysis. The adiponectin-leptin ratio correlated best with the clamp derived sensitivity index (r=0.553, p&lt;0.001) compared to other surrogate measures of insulin resistance. In multiple linear regression models including different surrogate measures of insulin resistance as independent predictors of the sensitivity index, the model with the adiponectin-leptin ratio accounted for the highest variability of the sensitivity index (r2=0.336, p&lt;0.001). The adiponectin-leptin ratio is associated with insulin resistance, measured with the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp, in Caucasians with T2D. The association with clamp derived sensitivity index is even stronger than that of HOMA, QUICKI, fasting glucose/insulin ratio or McAuley index and is independent of body mass index or glycemic control. The adiponectin-leptin ratio promises to become a new laboratory marker of insulin resistance in T2D.",

    "abstract": "Moxonidine is a selective imidazoline receptor agonist with comparable blood pressure-lowering efficacy to first-line antihypertensives and favorable metabolic effects. YKL-40 (chitinase-3-1-protein) has been proposed as a new marker of inflammation, atherosclerosis and endothelial dysfunction in neoplastic, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases but has not yet been studied in the context of essential hypertension. Fifteen patients (10 M, 5 F; age 48+/-14 years) with arterial hypertension and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR index &gt;2.77) on at least two antihypertensive drugs were randomized to receive either moxonidine (0.4 mg) or amlodipine (10 mg) for two 8-week periods with a 7-day wash-out. Serum insulin, glucose, C-reactive protein (CRP), lipids, uric acid, YKL-40 and blood pressure were measured and insulin sensitivity was calculated (HOMA) at the beginning and end of each study phase. Mean BP decreased significantly with both moxonidine and amlodipine (-9.8+/-7.6 and -10.4+/-7.3 mm Hg, respectively). Serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased with both therapies, but only moxonidine-affected serum triglycerides. No significant changes in serum uric acid, CRP, YKL-40 (2.3 and 3.3 ng ml(-1), respectively) or HOMA index (0.70+/-2.4 and 0.76+/-2.8) were observed. There was a strong negative correlation between serum uric acid and YKL-40 concentration at baseline (r=-0.77, P=0.01). Serum YKL-40 did not correlate with blood pressure, biochemical parameters or HOMA index. Moxonidine is an effective adjunctive antihypertensive agent for use in patients with hypertension and insulin resistance that induces beneficial effects on serum lipid profile but does not reduce insulin resistance, inflammation or serum YKL-40 concentration.",

    "title": "Effect of orlistat on the total ghrelin and leptin levels in obese patients.",
    "abstract": "Obesity, characterized by hyperleptinemia and hypoghrelinemia, has become a major health problem all over the world and is associated with an increased risk of complications including insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis. The use of the pancreatic lipase inhibitor Orlistat can help seriously overweight people to achieve and maintain weight loss. The aim of our study was to compare the serum leptin and ghrelin levels in obese subjects who take orlistat with those receiving only dietary treatment. Twenty-one obese patients and 10 control subjects participated. The obese patients were divided into two groups; one group (n=11) took orlistat (120 mg, 3 times daily) and received dietary treatment and the other (n=10) only received the dietary treatment. The study lasted twelve weeks. The concentrations of serum ghrelin, leptin, insulin and C-peptide, and routine biochemical parameters, were measured in both groups. The serum ghrelin level was higher in control (183+/-62 fmol/ml) than obese (59+/-30 fmol/ml) subjects while the plasma leptin level was lower in control (8.7+/-12 microg/L) than obese (36.7+/-19 microg/L) subjects (all p&lt;0.001). BMI and the total blood cholesterol, LDL and triglyceride levels fell significantly after both orlistat and dietary treatment in the obese subjects (all p&lt;0.01), and the plasma ghrelin level rose (p&lt;0.01). The leptin level demonstrated the opposite trend in both groups but only the patients taking orlistat showed a significant change (p&lt;0.05).Taken together, these results show that orlistat has no effect on body weight in obese subjects additional to that conferred by a non-pharmacological life-style intervention. We therefore conclude that weight lost rather than type of treatment might be more valuable in obesity.",

We studied a total of 21 adolescents (BMI percentile, 99.0 +/- 0.6 for 15 obese and 56.2 +/- 1.1 for 6 lean). The obese subjects underwent a 3-month randomized controlled physical activity-based lifestyle intervention. Leptin, soluble leptin receptor (sOB-R), ghrelin, and obestatin levels were determined as the primary outcome measures. Other markers of cardiometabolic disease such as inflammation and insulin resistance were also determined. Body composition was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The concentrations of ghrelin, obestatin, and sOB-R were significantly lower in the obese children compared to the lean controls, whereas that of leptin was higher (all P &lt; 0.05). Although intervention led to a net increase in obestatin (P &lt; 0.01) and no change in ghrelin levels, the balance between ghrelin and obestatin (ratio of ghrelin to obestatin, G/O) decreased (P &lt; 0.02). Intervention reduced leptin and increased sOB-R (P &lt; 0.01 for both). Significant associations between satiety factors and other cardiometabolic risk factors were also observed. Taken together, alterations in the levels of satiety factors are evident early in the clinical course of obesity, but physical activity-based lifestyle intervention either prevented their continued increase or normalized their levels. These beneficial effects appear to aid in the maintenance of body weight and reduction in cardiovascular risk.",

Mean serum HMW adiponectin levels were significantly lower in the current smokers than in the never- and ex-smokers but showed no significant difference between the light and heavy-smokers. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that smoking status was significantly associated with HMW adiponectin levels, as were age, BMI, alcohol consumption, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

    "abstract": "The chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1) gene acts as a cellular survival factor in response to several environmental and psychosocial stresses. The expression level of CHI3L1 was increased in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex regions of patients with schizophrenia. Genetic variants of the CHI3L1 gene have been significantly associated with schizophrenia in two distinct ethnic groups, the Chinese and Irish populations. The aims of this study are to confirm the association between the CHI3L1 gene and schizophrenia in a Japanese population using the largest sample size to date (1463 cases and 1795 controls) and perform a meta-analysis of the combined samples (3005 cases, 3825 controls and 601 trios). We found significant associations between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 4/rs4950928 (p=0.009), which is located in the promoter region of the CHI3L1 gene, and haplotypes including this SNP and schizophrenia (the most significant global p&lt;0.001). As the meta-analysis of the combined samples showed significant heterogeneity among studies of SNP3/rs10399805 (p=0.026) and SNP4 (p&lt;0.001), we performed meta-analyses separately in the Japanese (2033 cases and 2365 controls) and Chinese populations (412 cases, 464 controls and 601 trios), the major groups analyzed in association studies of the CHI3L1 gene. The meta-analysis in Japanese populations showed stronger evidence for the association of schizophrenia with SNP4 (p=0.003), while the meta-analysis in Chinese populations showed an association with a different variant (SNP3) (p=0.003). We conclude that the genetic variants in the CHI3L1 gene have ethnic heterogeneity and confer a susceptibility to schizophrenia in Asian populations.",

Five SNPs were genome-wide significant in their relationship with adiponectin (P&lt; or =5x10(-8)). We then tested whether these 5 SNPs were associated with risk of T2D and CHD using a Bonferroni-corrected threshold of P&lt; or =0.011 to declare statistical significance for these disease associations. SNPs at the adiponectin-encoding ADIPOQ locus demonstrated the strongest associations with adiponectin levels (P-combined = 9.2x10(-19) for lead SNP, rs266717, n = 14,733). A novel variant in the ARL15 (ADP-ribosylation factor-like 15) gene was associated with lower circulating levels of adiponectin (rs4311394-G, P-combined = 2.9x10(-8), n = 14,733). This same risk allele at ARL15 was also associated with a higher risk of CHD (odds ratio [OR] = 1.12, P = 8.5x10(-6), n = 22,421) more nominally, an increased risk of T2D (OR = 1.11, P = 3.2x10(-3), n = 10,128), and several metabolic traits. Expression studies in humans indicated that ARL15 is well-expressed in skeletal muscle. These findings identify a novel protein, ARL15, which influences circulating adiponectin levels and may impact upon CHD risk.",

    "title": "Effective removal of leptin via hemodiafiltration with on-line endogenous reinfusion therapy.",
    "abstract": "Leptin is a middle-molecular weight uremic toxin. Hemodiafiltration with on-line endogenous reinfusion (HFR) is a novel dialytic method combining the processes of diffusion, convection and adsorption. We performed a prospective crossover study of patients with end-stage renal disease to investigate the effect of HFR therapy on the level of leptin as compared to conventional low flux hemodialysis (LHD). Eleven stable hemodialysis patients were treated with LHD for 12 weeks and then treated with HFR (SG30 Plus; Sorin Group Italia S.r.1, Mirandola, Italy) for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks of HFR treatment, serum leptin levels significantly decreased (17.1 (2.66 - 39.5) at Week 12 vs. 12.3 (1.80 - 24.3) ng/ml at Week 24, p = 0.014). Although serum adiponectin levels also decreased (1.66 (1.44 - 1.86) at Week 12 vs. 1.12 (0.79 - 1.34) g/ml at Week 24, p = 0.001), the ratio of leptin to adiponectin did not increase after HFR treatment. Serum beta2-microglobulin (beta2M) levels significantly decreased (37.7 (29.8 - 42.6) at Week 12 vs. 28.3 (26.5 - 32.2) mg/dl at Week 24, p = 0.002). Dry weight, Kt/V(urea), normalized protein equivalent of nitrogen appearance, subjective global assessment, and serum albumin levels of the patients were not changed after HFR treatment. There was no difference in the serum levels of C-reactive protein or interleukin-6 between Week 12 and Week 24. The results of our study indicate that HFR may be a better therapy than LHD for removal of middle-molecular-weight uremic toxins such as leptin and b2M.",

    "title": "Prospective, randomized, single-blind comparison of effects of 6 months of treatment with telmisartan versus enalapril on high-molecular-weight adiponectin concentrations in patients with coronary artery disease.",
    "abstract": "High-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin has important antiatherosclerotic properties. This study compared circulating HMW adiponectin concentrations and other parameters between patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and participants without CAD. We investigated whether treatment with statins and either telmisartan or enalapril might affect HMW adiponectin and other parameters in patients with CAD. Finally, adiponectin concentrations were compared after 6 months of treatment between CAD patients with versus without cardiac events. Consecutive patients with stable CAD admitted to our hospital (Iwate Medical University School of Medicine, Iwate, Japan) for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and stent implantation and with no previous treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers or statins were recruited. Patients with CAD who met all eligibility criteria were randomly assigned using computer-generated numbers in a 1:1 ratio to receive telmisartan (40 mg/d) or enalapril (5 mg/d) for 6 months. In addition, all patients with CAD were treated with atorvastatin (10 mg/d). The patients without CAD received no treatment with telmisartan, enalapril, or atorvastatin. Plasma concentrations of total and HMW adiponectin were measured using a highly sensitive ELISA system before PCI or drug treatment (ie, baseline) and after 6 months of treatment. In addition, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were measured. To evaluate cardiac events, follow-up coronary angiography was performed at least 6 months after PCI. This study included 70 patients with stable CAD (mean [SD] age, 65.8 [10.9] years; male/female ratio, 55/15) and 25 participants with normal results on coronary angiography (non-CAD) (mean age, 63.5 [11.2] years; male/female ratio, 20/5). Baseline concentrations (mean [SD]) of HMW adiponectin were significantly lower in the CAD group than in the non-CAD group (2.0 [0.3] vs 9.2 [0.5] microg/mL; P &lt; 0.01). The ratio of HMW to total adiponectin was also lower in the CAD group than in the non-CAD group (0.37 [0.02] vs 0.53 [0.02]; P &lt; 0.01). Baseline concentrations of HMW adiponectin were negatively correlated with hs-CRP (r = -0.60) and HOMA-IR (r = -0.30) in patients with CAD. After 6 months of treatment, the telmisartan group showed significantly increased HMW adiponectin concentrations and HMW/total adiponectin ratio (HMW, 3.7 [0.7] vs 2.1 [0.5] microg/mL; P &lt; 0.01 vs baseline; HMW/total, 0.44 [0.02] vs 0.39 [0.02]; P &lt; 0.05 vs baseline), whereas HOMA-IR was significantly decreased (2.86 [1.93] vs 3.39 [1.77]; P &lt; 0.05 vs baseline). HOMA-IR at follow-up was significantly lower in the telmisartan group than in the enalapril group (2.86 [1.93] vs 3.64 [1.45]; P &lt; 0.05). In contrast, treatment with enalapril was not associated with any significant changes in total or HMW adiponectin concentrations, HMW/total adiponectin ratio, or HOMA-IR. Both the telmisartan and the enalapril groups showed significant decreases in hs-CRP after 6 months (P &lt; 0.05 vs baseline). After 6 months of treatment with either telmisartan or enalapril, HMW adiponectin concentrations were 0.7 (0.2) microg/mL with cardiac events versus 3.2 (0.4) microg/mL without (P &lt; 0.05); HMW/total concentrations were 0.25 (0.03) with cardiac events versus 0.43 (0.01) without (P &lt; 0.01). In contrast, hs-CRP concentrations were higher in patients with cardiac events than in those without cardiac events (2.42 [0.52] vs 1.86 [0.45] log10 microg/dL; P &lt; 0.01). This study found that treatment with telmisartan and statins (but not enalapril and statins) was associated with a significant increase in HMW adiponectin concentrations and a decrease in insulin resistance in these patients with CAD.",

    "abstract": "To compare the effects of lipophilic simvastatin and hydrophilic rosuvastatin on plasma adiponectin and glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in patients with non-ischaemic chronic heart failure (NICHF). Seventy-one stable outpatients with NICHF, who were already receiving standard therapy for CHF, were randomized to simvastatin (n = 35) or rosuvastatin (n = 36). Plasma levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), total adiponectin, high-sensitive C-reactive protein, HbA1c, and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), a marker of oxidative stress, were measured before and 4 months after treatment with simvastatin or rosuvastatin. There was no difference in the baseline characteristics including left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and biochemical parameters between the two groups. In both groups, plasma BNP levels and LVEF did not change after 4 months. Plasma levels of adiponectin and oxLDL did not change and HbA1c level was slightly increased (6.0 +/- 0.9 vs. 6.1 +/- 0.9%, P = 0.053) in the simvastatin group. In contrast, plasma adiponectin level was significantly increased (12.3 +/- 7.3 vs. 14.0 +/- 8.2 microg/mL, P = 0.012) concomitant with a significant reduction in oxLDL and HbA1c (oxLDL: 8.8 +/- 4.7 vs. 7.6 +/- 4.7 U/mL, P = 0.0059; HbA1c: 6.0 +/- 0.7 vs. 5.9 +/- 0.7%, P = 0.002) in the rosuvastatin group. These findings suggest that hydrophilic rosuvastatin but not lipophilic simvastatin increases adiponectin and decreases HbA1c levels in patients with NICHF.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of pioglitazone treatment on the progression of subclinical atherosclerosis and insulin resistance in renal allograft recipients with no preoperative history of diabetes. Eighty-three patients without diabetes were randomly assigned to either the pioglitazone group or the control group. Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), serum adiponectin level and lipid profile were assessed before transplantation and at 12 months after transplantation. Insulin secretory function and insulin resistance were evaluated by the oral glucose tolerance test. The pioglitazone group showed a significant reduction in the mean and maximum carotid IMT compared with the control group after 12 months (mean carotid IMT, 0.05 +/- 0.04 vs -0.03 +/- 0.07 mm, P &lt; 0.001; maximum carotid IMT, 0.08 +/- 0.05 vs -0.05 +/- 0.09 mm, P &lt; 0.001). Pioglitazone increased the adiponectin level, and the change in adiponectin was negatively correlated with carotid IMT changes. Pioglitazone treatment increased the insulin sensitivity index compared with the control group (-0.8 +/- 3.1x10(-)(2) vs +1.1 +/- 3.7x10(-)(2), P = 0.036). These results suggest that pioglitazone treatment reduces the progression of carotid IMT and improves insulin resistance in renal allograft recipients without a history of diabetes.

    "abstract": "Based on animal studies and pilot studies in humans, betaine, a methyl donor for the remethylation of homocysteine, may be a therapeutic agent for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We evaluated the safety and efficacy of betaine for patients with NASH and whether betaine positively modified factors postulated to be second hits and underlying mechanisms of NASH. We conducted a randomized placebo-control study of 55 patients with biopsy-proven NASH who received either oral betaine (20 g daily) or placebo for 12 months. Pre- and posttreatment variables were analyzed using the paired t test or Wilcoxon rank test. Treatment groups were comparable at baseline. Of the 35 patients (17 betaine, 18 placebo) who completed the study, 34 patients (16 betaine, 18 placebo) underwent posttreatment liver biopsy. Patients randomized to betaine had a decrease in steatosis grade. No intra- or intergroup differences or changes in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score or fibrosis stage were noted. Elevations of insulin, glucose, and proinflammatory cytokines and the reduced antioxidant status noted in NASH patients did not improve with betaine therapy. The antiinflammatory agent adiponectin was significantly reduced in both groups and did not change with therapy. Lastly, S-adenosylhomocysteine was approximately twice normal and was not reduced by betaine therapy. Compared to placebo, betaine did not improve hepatic steatosis but may protect against worseningsteatosis [corrected]. High-dose betaine supplementation failed to reduce S-adenosylhomocysteine and did not positively affect any of the second hit mechanisms postulated to contribute to NASH that we studied. Although betaine has been proven effective in treating hepatic steatosis in several animal models, translating novel therapeutic options noted in animal studies to humans with NASH will prove challenging.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin is a major adipocyte-derived protein with insulin-sensitizing, anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic properties. Adiponectin levels correlate inversely with renal function and higher levels are predictive of lower cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with normal renal function and chronic kidney disease. No data exists on the association between adiponectin and CVD in renal transplant recipients (RTR). Standard biochemistry, clinical data and adiponectin were collected from 137 RTR recruited to the LANDMARK 2 study at baseline. The LANDMARK 2 study is an ongoing randomized controlled study that compares the outcome of aggressive risk factor modification for cardiovascular disease versus standard post-transplant care in renal transplant recipients with impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes mellitus. Mean patient age was 53.4 +/- 12 years and the median post-transplantation period was 5 (0.5-31.9) years. Mean serum adiponectin level was 12.3 +/- 7.1 microg/mL. On univariate analysis, adiponectin was positively associated with female gender (P = 0.01) and serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentration (P &lt; 0.001), and inversely with body mass index (P = 0.009), metabolic syndrome (P = 0.047), abnormal glucose tolerance (P = 0.01), C-reactive protein (P = 0.001) and serum triglyceride (P &lt; 0.001). On stepwise multivariate analysis, adiponectin in males was negatively correlated with combined baseline CVD (P = 0.03), waist-hip ratio (P = 0.003) and glomerular filtration rate (P = 0.046), and positively with HDL (P &lt; 0.001). In contrast, in females adiponectin was inversely associated with C-reactive protein (P = 0.001) and serum triglyceride. In conclusion, adiponectin is positively correlated with inflammation, dyslipidemia and abnormal glucose tolerance in RTR. Furthermore, hypoadiponectinemia correlated with increased baseline CVD in male RTR.",

    "abstract": "Autoantigen-specific immunotherapy by mucosal tolerance induction via the intranasal route is an attractive therapeutic option for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Human cartilage glycoprotein-39 (HC gp-39) has been identified as a potential key autoantigen in RA. Based on animal studies, intranasal administration of the autoantigen is hypothesised to induce immunological tolerance in patients with RA and to ameliorate disease activity. In a phase I/IIA clinical trial in patients with RA, intranasal application of HC gp-39 was safe and well tolerated. To investigate the efficacy of intranasally administered fully human, recombinant HC gp-39 (Org 39141) by a large clinical study. In a 13-week multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-finding, proof-of-concept trial, patients with RA (disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) naive or after washout of DMARD treatment) were randomised to receive either intranasal applications of placebo or HC gp-39 in doses of 30, 150, 300 or 600 microg, once a week. The primary efficacy variable was the 28 joint count Disease Activity Score (DAS28). During the treatment period the DAS28 decreased similarly for all treatment groups-including placebo-indicating lack of efficacy of intranasal HC gp-39 treatment in the current setting. Safety variables were similar for all study groups. It was concluded that with the treatment protocol used (dose levels and frequency of dosing), intranasal treatment with Org 39141 was safe but did not result in more clinical improvement than in placebo-treated patients.",

    "abstract": "Prognostic biomarkers are needed to identify children at increased cardiometabolic risk. The objective was to study whether markers of metabolism and inflammation, for example, circulating plasma adiponectin, leptin, interleukin-8, and hepatocyte growth factor, are associated with cardiometabolic risk factors in childhood and adolescence. This was a cross-sectional and prospective study, and the setting was the Danish part of the European Youth Heart Studies I and II. Participants were randomly selected girls and boys 8 to 10 years of age with complete baseline data (n = 256) and complete follow-up data 6 years later (n = 169). Cardiometabolic risk profile was calculated using a continuous composite score derived from summing of 6 factors standardized to the sample means (Z scores): body mass index, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, total serum cholesterol to serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, serum triglycerides, systolic blood pressure, and the reciprocal value of fitness (maximum watts per kilogram). Overweight was defined using international classification of body mass index cutoff points for children. Plasma adiponectin, leptin, interleukin-8, and hepatocyte growth factor were assessed using immunochemical assays. Linear relationships were found between metabolic risk score and both plasma adiponectin (inverse, P = .02) and plasma leptin (P &lt; .0001) at baseline after adjustment for several confounders. In overweight but not normal-weight children, plasma adiponectin at baseline was inversely associated with metabolic risk score 6 years later (P = .04). In childhood, both hypoadiponectinemia and hyperleptinemia accompany a negative metabolic risk profile. In addition, circulating plasma adiponectin may be a useful biomarker to identify overweight children at greater future risk of the cardiometabolic adverse effects of overweight.",

    "abstract": "Increased circulating adiponectin and insulin sensitivity are usually observed after body fat loss induced by a weight-loss diet. Progressive resistance training (PRT) without a concomitant weight-loss diet significantly decreases visceral fat, thus improving insulin sensitivity. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to ascertain the effects of combined 16-week PRT and weight-loss diet on circulating adiponectin and insulin sensitivity index. Thirty-four obese (BMI: 30-40 kg/m(2)) women, aged 40-60 year, were randomized to three groups: a control group (C; n = 9); a diet group (WL; n = 12) with a caloric restriction of 500 kcal/d; and a diet plus resistance training group (WL+RT; n = 13) with the same caloric restriction as group WL and a 16-week supervised whole body PRT of two sessions/week. Both WL and WL+RT groups showed similar decreases in body mass (-6.3% and -7.7%) and visceral fat (-19.9% and -20.5%). WL resulted in an expected increase in circulating levels of adiponectin (P = 0.07) and insulin sensitivity. However, circulating total adiponectin decreased (P &lt; 0.05) in WL+RT group, whereas an improvement in different cardiovascular risk factors (insulin sensitivity, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), etc.) was observed. In conclusion, in obese women a 16-week combined PRT and weight-loss diet is accompanied by significant improvements in different cardiovascular risk factors in spite of a significant decrease of circulating adiponectin.",

    "title": "Dairy products and metabolic effects in overweight men and women: results from a 6-mo intervention study.",
    "abstract": "Some epidemiologic studies have suggested inverse relations between intake of dairy products and components of the metabolic syndrome. The objective was to investigate the effects of an increased intake of dairy products in persons with a habitually low intake on body composition and factors related to the metabolic syndrome. Middle-aged overweight subjects (n = 121) with traits of the metabolic syndrome were recruited in Finland, Norway, and Sweden and randomly assigned into milk or control groups. The milk group was instructed to consume 3-5 portions of dairy products daily. The control group maintained their habitual diet. Clinical investigations were conducted on admission and after 6 mo. There were no significant differences between changes in body weight or body composition, blood pressure, markers of inflammation, endothelial function, adiponectin, or oxidative stress in the milk and the control groups. There was a modest unfavorable increase in serum cholesterol concentrations in the milk group (P = 0.043). Among participants with a low calcium intake at baseline (&lt;700 mg/d), there was a significant treatment effect for waist circumference (P = 0.003) and sagittal abdominal diameter (P = 0.034). When the sexes were analyzed separately, leptin increased (P = 0.045) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 decreased (P = 0.001) in women in the milk group. This study gives no clear support to the hypothesis that a moderately increased intake of dairy products beneficially affects aspects of the metabolic syndrome. The apparently positive effects on waist circumference and sagittal abdominal diameter in subjects with a low calcium intake suggest a possible threshold in relation to effects on body composition.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin is an anti-inflammatory and potentially antiatherogenic molecule. Some recent reports suggest that tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) blockade therapy increases circulating adiponectin levels, but data are sparse and inconsistent. Data from a double-blind placebo controlled study of onercept in 126 patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and from pre- and post-adalimumab treatment in 171 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were used to examine the effect of TNFalpha blockade therapy on adiponectin. Despite expected associations of adiponectin with gender and baseline high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride, adiponectin levels did not change over time with TNFalpha blockade therapy in either group. The mean+/-SD absolute change in adiponectin levels was -0.23+/-4.6 microg/ml in patients with PsA treated with combined onercept 50 mg and onercept 100 mg (vs placebo, p=0.60) and 0.28+/-3.23 microg/ml in patients with RA treated with adalimumab (vs baseline, p=0.66). These results do not support a significant effect of TNFalpha blockade therapy on circulating adiponectin levels in patients with autoimmune disease.",

    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). A few studies have demonstrated elevated plasma adiponectin and leptin levels in CKD. The aims of this study were to assess whether 1) estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is associated with plasma leptin and adiponectin; and 2) adiponectin and leptin (partly) explain associations of CKD with endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance, and low-grade inflammation in patients with K/DOQI Stage 3 - 5 CKD. Baseline data from 91 patients with Stage 3 - 4 CKD in the anti-oxidant therapy in chronic renal insufficiency study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, in which the effects of oxidative stress-lowering treatment on vascular function and structure were studied, and from 50 dialysis na&#xef;ve patients, who took part in an open-label, randomized study that compared two peritoneal dialysis regimens, used in the analysis. All subjects for both the studies were recruited in the same centres. The association between eGFR and adiponectin was non-linear. In multivariate analysis, log-eGFR (unstandardized beta = 8.303 microg/ml, p &lt; 0.0001) was the strongest determinant of adiponectin, and body mass index the strongest determinant of leptin (beta = 2.477 ng/ml, p &lt; 0.0001). Plasma adiponectin and leptin did not modify the associations between eGFR and plasma von Willebrand factor or soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1. Plasma leptin had the strongest association with the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) index. Plasma C-reactive protein had no association with adiponectin or leptin. In patients with K/DOQI Stage 3 - 5 CKD, renal function had a significant non-linear inverse association with and was the strongest predictor of adiponectin. BMI was the strongest predictor of plasma leptin. Plasma adiponectin and leptin did not explain, and thus presumably are not involved in, the association between eGFR and some markers of endothelial dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Critically ill patients requiring intensive care uniformly develop insulin resistance. This is most pronounced in patients with sepsis. Recently, several hormones secreted by adipose tissue have been identified to be involved in overall insulin sensitivity in metabolic syndrome-related conditions. However, little is known about these adipokines in critical illness. We studied circulating levels of the adipokines adiponectin, retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4), and leptin during critical illness, and the impact of intensive insulin therapy, a therapy shown to affect insulin sensitivity, in serum samples from prolonged critically ill patients with a respiratory critical illness (n = 318). For comparison, we studied healthy subjects (n = 22) and acutely stressed patients (n = 22). During acute critical illness, circulating levels of adiponectin, RBP4, and leptin were low. Patients with sepsis had lower levels of leptin and RBP4 than did nonseptic patients. When critical illness was sustained, adipokine levels returned to normal reference values. Insulin therapy enhanced adiponectin, blunted the rise of RBP4, and did not alter leptin levels. Acute critical illness is associated with immediate, but transiently low serum adipokine levels. Adiponectin and RBP4 are associated with altered insulin resistance in critical illness.",

A total of 267 women [mean body mass index (BMI)=32.0+/-5.7kg/m(2) and mean age=57.3+/-6.6 years] underwent a 6-month exercise intervention program. Exercise training was performed 3-4 times per week at a targeted heart rate corresponding to 50% of the maximal oxygen consumption. Compared to baseline values, mean change in relative VO(2) max (the primary endpoint) was of 1.18+/-2.25mL/minkg (p&lt;0.0001), mean weight loss was of 1.4+/-3.3kg (p&lt;0.0001), mean reduction in waist circumference was of 2.4+/-6.9cm (p&lt;0.0001) and systolic blood pressure did not change significantly (-1.2+/-13.0mmHg, NS). No changes were observed in markers of the lipoprotein-lipid profile. No changes were observed for plasma levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, tumor-necrosis factor-alpha and adiponectin. Changes in VO(2) max were negatively associated with changes in body weight (r=-0.26, p&lt;0.0001) and waist circumference (r=-0.16, p=0.01), but not with changes in cardiometabolic risk markers. Although exercise training significantly increased cardiorespiratory fitness in these sedentary, but metabolically healthy obese/overweight women with a moderately elevated systolic blood pressure, no significant improvements were observed in their cardiometabolic risk profile.",

    "abstract": "The intake of wholemeal foods is consistently associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases in epidemiological studies, although the mechanisms of this association are unclear. Here we aim to compare in healthy subjects the metabolic effects of a diet rich in wholemeal wheat foods versus one based on the same products in refined form. Fifteen healthy individuals (12 M/3 F), mean age 54.5+/-7.6 years, BMI 27.4+/-3.0 kg/m(2) (mean+/-SD), participated in a randomized sequential crossover study. After 2 weeks run-in, participants were randomly assigned to two isoenergetic diets with similar macronutrient composition, one rich in wholemeal wheat foods and the other with the same foods but in refined form (cereal fibre 23.1 vs. 9.8 g/day). After the two treatment periods (each lasting 3 weeks) plasma glucose and lipid metabolism, antioxidant activity, acetic acid, magnesium, adipokines, incretins and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were measured at fasting and for 4h after a standard test meal (kcal 1103, protein 12%, CHO 53%, fat 35%) based on wholemeal or refined wheat foods, respectively. After the two diets there were no differences in fasting nor in postprandial plasma parameter responses; only glucose was slightly but significantly lower at 240 min after the refined wheat food meal compared to the wholemeal wheat food meal. Conversely, after the wholemeal diet both total (-4.3%; p&lt;0.03) and LDL (-4.9%; p&lt;0.04) cholesterol levels were lower than after the refined wheat diet at fasting. Consumption of wholemeal wheat foods for 3 weeks reduces significantly fasting plasma cholesterol as well as LDL cholesterol levels in healthy individuals without major effects on glucose and insulin metabolism, antioxidant status and sub-clinical inflammation markers.",

    "abstract": "Acute effects of high-sugar/low-fiber meals vs low-sugar/high-fiber meals on hormones and behavior were studied in 10 overweight Latina females, age 11 to 12 years, using a crossover design. In this exploratory pilot study, participants arrived fasted at an observation laboratory on two occasions and randomly received either a high-sugar/low-fiber meal or a low-sugar/high-fiber meal at each visit. Glucose, insulin, and leptin were assayed from serum drawn at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. Ad libitum snacks were provided at 120 minutes. Physical activity was measured using an observational system that provides data on time spent lying down, sitting, standing, walking, and in vigorous activity. Data were collected between March 2005 and July 2006. In the high-sugar/low-fiber condition, glucose and leptin levels decreased more slowly, glucose levels were higher at 60 minutes (111.2 mg/dL vs 95.4 mg/dL, P=0.03), and leptin levels were higher at 90 minutes (49.3 ng/mL vs 46.7 ng/mL, P=0.017) than in the low-sugar/high-fiber condition. Meals did not affect insulin or ad libitum dietary intake. Sitting, standing, lying down, and vigorous activity differed by condition, but not walking. Participants were significantly more active in the first 30 to 60 minutes after the high-sugar/low-fiber meal, but after 60 minutes there was a trend for activity to be lower after the high-sugar/low-fiber meal vs the low-sugar/high-fiber meal. High-sugar meals sustain glucose and leptin levels longer, which may play an important role in modulating levels of physical activity in this group at high risk for obesity-related disease.",

    "abstract": "In contrast to the general population, a higher body mass index is associated with better survival among hemodialysis patients. Theoretically, high energy supplementation in these patients ought to lead to weight gain over time, but the benefits of this strategy are unclear. The objective was to assess whether high energy supplementation in nondiabetic hemodialysis patients might adversely affect insulin resistance -- a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease. We first investigated the association between body fat mass and insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance; HOMA-IR) in nondiabetic hemodialysis patients in a cross-sectional analysis (study 1). Of the 106 individuals studied, 55 were randomly assigned to either high energy supplementation (an extra 475 kcal/d; n = 28) or not (n = 27) for 12 wk to assess prospective changes in body fat mass and insulin resistance (study 2). In study 1, body fat mass (P &lt; 0.05) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (P &lt; 0.05) each contributed independently to HOMA-IR. In study 2, 41 patients completed the study. The 20 patients who received high energy supplementation had a significantly greater increase in body fat mass (P &lt; 0.05), CRP (P &lt; 0.05), and HOMA-IR (P &lt; 0.001) than did the 21 controls. Body fat mass and CRP are primary determinants of insulin resistance in nondiabetic hemodialysis patients. High energy supplementation, because it increases adiposity and inflammation, exacerbates insulin resistance. A long-term study is needed to clarify the metabolic effects of high energy supplementation on cardiovascular disease outcomes in hemodialysis patients.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown increases in ambulatory short-term blood pressure (BP) variability to be related to cardiovascular disease. In this study, we examined whether an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker losartan would improve ambulatory short-term BP variability in hypertensive patients on hemodialysis. Forty hypertensive patients on hemodialysis therapy were randomly assigned to the losartan treatment group (n=20) or the control treatment group (n=20). At baseline and 6 and 12 months after the treatment, 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring was performed. Echocardiography and measurements of brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and biochemical parameters were also performed before and after therapy. After 6- and 12-months of treatment, nighttime short-term BP variability, assessed on the basis of the coefficient of variation of ambulatory BP, was significantly decreased in the losartan group, but remained unchanged in the control group. Compared with the control group, losartan significantly decreased left ventricular mass index (LVMI), baPWV, and the plasma levels of brain natriuretic peptide and advanced glycation end products (AGE). Furthermore, multiple regression analysis showed significant correlations between changes in LVMI and changes in nighttime short-term BP variability, as well as between changes in LVMI and changes in the plasma levels of AGE. These results suggest that losartan is beneficial for the suppression of pathological cardiovascular remodeling though its inhibitory effect on ambulatory short-term BP variability during nighttime.",

    "abstract": "Compared to vegetable oils in their unmodified state, partially-hydrogenated fat is associated with less favorable effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Acceptable alternatives must be adjudicated. Our objective was to assess the effect of a recent commercial fat substitution, corn oil for partially-hydrogenated soybean oil. Using a double-blind cross-over design, 30 postmenopausal women &gt;or=50 years with LDL-cholesterol concentrations &gt;or=120 mg/dL were randomly assigned to each of two 35-day phases; all food and beverage was provided to maintain body weight. Corn or partially-hydrogenated soybean oil was incorporated throughout the diet and contributed two-thirds of fat. Primary outcomes included fasting and non-fasting lipid, lipoprotein, apolipoprotein, and fasting high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) concentrations; secondary outcomes included fasting small dense LDL (sdLDL)-cholesterol, remnant lipoprotein cholesterol (RemLC), glycated albumin, adiponectin and immunoreactive insulin concentrations, and endogenous cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) and lecithin:cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) activities. Relative to the partially-hydrogenated soybean oil enriched diet, the corn oil enriched diet resulted in lower fasting total cholesterol (7%; P&lt;0.0001), LDL-cholesterol (10%; P&lt;0.0001), VLDL-cholesterol (7%; P=0.052), apo B (9%; P&lt;0.0001), lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] (5%; P=0.024), sdLDL-cholesterol (17%; P=0.001), and RemLC (20%; P=0.007) concentrations, and no significant effect on the other outcomes. Changes in postprandial (4-h post-meal) lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein concentrations were similar to the fasting state. The replacement of partially-hydrogenated soybean oil with corn oil favorably affects a range of CVD risk factors and is an appropriate option to decrease cardiovascular disease risk factors in moderately hypercholesterolemic individuals.",

We questioned whether reduction in proteinuria not only lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), but also high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) mass and whether changes in HDL-C were related to changes in plasma adiponectin. Thirty-two non-diabetic proteinuric patients (12 on statin therapy), were followed during two double blind 6-week periods of placebo and treatment (low sodium + 100mg losartan + 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide). With placebo HDL-C was lower but LDL-C and CETP were not different in proteinuric patients compared with matched controls. LDL-C, HDL-C and CETP decreased upon proteinuria reduction. The decrease in LDL-C correlated with the drop in CETP and the degree of proteinuria reduction. HDL-C also decreased in proportion to proteinuria lowering. Individual changes in HDL-C were correlated with changes in adiponectin. LDL-C lowering upon robust reduction of proteinuria may be affected by changes in plasma CETP mass, but this treatment also decreases HDL-C in relation to the degree of proteinuria reduction. This adverse effect on HDL-C may in part be attributable to changes in adiponectin.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is usually preceded by endothelial dysfunction and altered myocardial blood flow (MBF) regulation. Hyperglycemia, oxidative-nitrosative stress, systemic inflammation, and insulin resistance are implicated in the pathogenesis of abnormal MBF regulation, myocardial ischemia, and apoptosis. However, the impact of oral antihyperglycemic therapy on myocardial perfusion is controversial. Our objective was to explore the effect of rosiglitazone and glyburide on nitrosative stress and MBF regulation in subjects with T2DM. [(13)N]ammonia positron emission tomography and cold pressor testing were used in 27 diabetic subjects (mean age, 49 +/- 11 years; glycohemoglobin, 7% +/- 1.5%) randomized to either rosiglitazone 8 mg/d or glyburide 10 mg/d for 6 months. Isotope dilution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to quantify plasma 3-nitrotyrosine, a stable marker of reactive nitrogen species. At 6 months, there were no significant differences between groups in the mean glycohemoglobin, blood pressure, or plasma lipids. Rosiglitazone significantly reduced plasma nitrotyrosine, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and von Willebrand antigen (P &lt; .03 for all) and significantly increased plasma adiponectin (P &lt; .05). No significant changes in these parameters were observed with glyburide. Treatment with glyburide, but not rosiglitazone, resulted in a significant deterioration in both resting and stress MBF. Rosiglitazone, but not glyburide, ameliorated markers of nitrosative stress and inflammation in subjects with T2DM without impairing myocardial perfusion.",

    "title": "Effect of surgery on cardiovascular risk factors in mild primary hyperparathyroidism.",
    "abstract": "Mild primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) seems to have a good prognosis, and indications for active treatment (surgery) are widely discussed. The extraskeletal effects of PTH, such as insulin resistance, arterial hypertension, and cardiovascular (CV) risk, may however be reversible by operation. Our aim was to study biochemical markers of bone turnover, indices of the metabolic syndrome, and various risk markers for CV disease in patients with mild pHPT randomized to observation without surgery or operative treatment and followed for 2 yr. A total of 116 patients (mean age, 63 +/- 8 yr; 19 men and 97 women) who on May 1, 2008, had performed the 2-yr visit in a randomized study on mild pHPT (serum calcium at baseline, 2.69 +/- 0.11 mmol/liter) and where frozen samples were available from baseline and follow-up participated in the study. Calcium and PTH levels were normalized after surgery, and biochemical markers of bone turnover decreased by 35%, followed by a significant increase in BMD in the spine (2.7%; P &lt; 0.01) and femoral neck (1.1%; P &lt; 0.02) compared with the observation group. No significant differences were observed between the groups for blood pressure, markers of insulin resistance, detailed cholesterol metabolism, adipokines, or parameters of inflammation and CV surrogate markers. We observed expected effects on biochemical markers of bone turnover and bone mass after surgical treatment of mild pHPT, with stable values in the group randomized to observation. For a variety of measures of the metabolic syndrome, adipokines, and CV risk factors, no benefit of operative treatment could be demonstrated. Neither did we observe any deleterious effects of conservative management in the 2-yr perspective.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral arterial occlusion disease (PAOD) is caused mainly by chronic inflammation and endothelium dysfunction, and is often treated with cilostazol. However, because this drug's influence on atherogenic cytokines is still not well known, this study examined the effect of cilostazol on the serum levels of soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L), adiponectin and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in patients with type 2 diabetes and PAOD. The 92 type 2 diabetics with PAOD and 100 non-PAOD diabetics were enrolled and randomly assigned to a group receiving either cilostazol or placebo for 6 months. The atherogenic cytokines were measured at the beginning and completion of the study. In the PAOD groups, those in the cilostazol group had significant changes in the levels of hs-CRP, sCD40L and adiponectin (P=0.001, P=0.05, P=0.004, respectively). Changes in the levels of adiponectin and sCD40L were more significant in the PAOD group treated with cilostazol than in the non-PAOD group also treated with the drug (P=0.01 and P=0.008, respectively). Cilostazol can decrease hs-CPR and sCD40L levels and increase that of adiponectin, and then delay the progression of atherogenesis and chronic inflammation in type 2 diabetics, especially those with PAOD.",

    "abstract": "Vitamin D deficiency and adipocytokines have been implicated in the etiology of aging-related diseases such as cancer, osteoporosis, and diseases of the cardiovascular system. The association between elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) and low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-VitD) in plasma is used to define vitamin D deficiency, yet their associated mechanistic pathways are unclear. Utilizing plasma samples from women in a previous intervention study, we measured plasma 25-OH-VitD, leptin, adiponectin, PTH, and lipid levels. We observed strong positive associations for leptin with PTH, gamma -tocopherol, and body mass index (BMI) and inverse associations with 25-OH-VitD and adiponectin. Although commonly accepted that vitamin D deficiency causes hyperparathyroidism, we observed this association primarily in individuals with elevated leptin levels, suggesting that leptin may be an important modifier of this effect consistent with 25-OH-VitD-mediated inhibition of leptin. Leptin was highly correlated with the BMI/25-OH-VitD ratio (r = 0.80; P &lt; 0.0001), consistent with a model in which BMI (adiposity) and 25-OH-VitD are the primary determinants of circulating leptin and PTH levels. This model may explain the failure of some studies to observe elevated PTH in vitamin D deficient adolescents and provides important insight into epidemiological studies exploring the associations of these individual biomarkers with chronic disease risk and mortality.",

    "abstract": "The authors compared effects of macronutrients on self-reported appetite and selected fasting hormone levels. The Optimal Macronutrient Intake Trial to Prevent Heart Disease (OMNI-Heart) (2003-2005) was a randomized, 3-period, crossover feeding trial (n = 164) comparing the effects of 3 diets, each rich in a different macronutrient. Percentages of kilocalories of carbohydrate, fat, and protein were 48, 27, and 25, respectively, for the protein-rich diet; 58, 27, and 15, for the carbohydrate-rich diet; and 48, 37, and 15 for the diet rich in unsaturated fat. Food and drink were provided for each isocaloric 6-week period. Appetite was measured by visual analog scales. Pairwise differences between diets were estimated using generalized estimating equations. Compared with the protein diet, premeal appetite was 14% higher on the carbohydrate (P = 0.01) and unsaturated-fat (P = 0.003) diets. Geometric mean leptin was 8% lower on the protein diet than on the carbohydrate diet (P = 0.003). Obestatin levels were 7% and 6% lower on the protein diet than on the carbohydrate (P = 0.02) and unsaturated-fat (P = 0.004) diets, respectively. There were no between-diet differences for ghrelin. A diet rich in protein from lean meat and vegetables reduces self-reported appetite compared with diets rich in carbohydrate and unsaturated fat and can be recommended in a weight-stable setting. The observed pattern of hormone changes does not explain the inverse association between protein intake and appetite.",

The purpose of our study was to investigate the relationship between adiponectin, leptin and renal function parameters in patients with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) above 90 ml/min/m(2) and type 2 diabetes. In 52 patients, plasma (P-) and urinary (U-) adiponectin and leptin were determined by radioimmunoassay and ELISA, respectively. Kidney function was assessed with GFR (plasma iohexol clearance) and albuminuria (radioimmunoassay). The patients were aged 58+/-8 years and had a mean BMI value of 31.2+/-5.2 kg/m(2). Our measurements yielded the following values, expressed as median (25th percentile, 75th percentile): P-adiponectin 11.0 (7.1, 14.5) microg/ml, P-leptin 20.7 (9.6, 35.9)ng/ml, U-adiponectin 0.8 (0.3, 1.2) microg/mg creatinine, and U-leptin 1.0 (0.4, 1.9) microg/mg creatinine. Albuminuria correlated with P-adiponectin (R=-0.31, p=0.03), and GFR correlated with U-leptin (R=-0.32, p=0.04). Adiponectin and leptin are associated with parameters of renal function already at the stage of apparently normal kidney function in type 2 diabetes.

    "abstract": "Plasma adiponectin concentration is inversely associated with renal function. There is little literature on adiponectin levels and regulation by anti-hypertensive medication with an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB), especially in subjects with type 2 diabetes in different stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Eighty subjects with type 2 diabetic nephropathy were randomly divided into two groups: losarten group (n = 41) and amlodipine group (n = 39). Fasting blood was drawn to determine HbA1c, insulin and adiponectin levels. Insulin resistance was calculated using fasting glucose and insulin, expressed as HOMA-IR. For assessment of the relationship between adiponectin and other parameters, Pearson sample correlation coefficients were used. After stratification, ARB losartan (100 mg daily) was administered for a period of 6 months. There is a positive association between adiponectin and proteinuria, fasting insulin levels and HOMA-IR in both CKD stage 1-2 and stage 3-4. Baseline adiponectin levels were not related to baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). At baseline, the adiponectin concentration was high in all observed subjects, and after 3 and 6 months of treatment with losartan, adiponectin levels decreased in the losartan group as compared with the amlodipine group (P &lt; 0.01). Also fasting insulin and HOMA-IR decreased during the 6-month follow-up compared with the control group (P &lt; 0.01). Our results demonstrate that serum adiponectin levels in type 2 diabetic nephropathy are strongly positively associated with fasting insulin levels and insulin resistance. Declines in fasting insulin and HOMA-IR by losartan are accompanied by decreased adiponectin levels, might offer potential protection in humans. The paradoxical phenomenon merits further ascertainment in future studies.",

    "abstract": "This study sought to better determine the link between leptin and coronary heart disease (CHD). Circulating leptin is considered a risk factor for CHD but larger studies are needed. Leptin levels were measured in 550 men with fatal CHD or nonfatal myocardial infarction and in 1,184 controls nested within a prospective study of 5,661 British men and set in context with a meta-analysis. Baseline leptin correlated with body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and inflammatory markers; correlations persisted after BMI adjustment. The within-person consistency of leptin values over 4 years (correlation coefficient: 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.73 to 0.83) was higher than those of some established cardiovascular risk factors. In a comparison of individuals in the top third with those in the bottom third of baseline leptin, the age- and town-adjusted odds ratio for CHD was 1.25 (95% CI: 0.96 to 1.62), decreasing to 0.98 (95% CI: 0.72 to 1.34) after adjustment for BMI. A systematic review identified 7 prospective reports with heterogeneous findings (I(2) = 60%, 13% to 82%). The combined adjusted risk ratio across all studies was 1.44 (95% CI: 0.95 to 2.16) in a comparison of extreme thirds of leptin levels. The inconsistency between studies was partially explained by sample size, with combined estimates from studies involving &gt;100 CHD cases (1.28, 95% CI: 0.80 to 2.04) being somewhat weaker than those from smaller studies (1.81, 95% CI: 0.76 to 4.31). Previous studies appear to have overestimated associations of leptin and CHD risk. Our results suggest a moderate association that is largely dependent on BMI.",

For 1 y, 187 men aged 45 +/- 2 y, approximately 50% of whom met the criteria of the metabolic syndrome, were randomly assigned to a diet protocol (n = 45), an exercise protocol (n = 48), a protocol of diet plus exercise (n = 58), or a control protocol (n = 36). A previously defined a priori diet score was created by summing tertile rankings of 35 food group variables; a higher score generally reflected recommended dietary changes in the trial (mean +/- SD at baseline: 31 +/- 6.5; range: 15-47). Over the study year, the diet score increased by approximately 2 +/- 5.5 in both diet groups, with a decrease of an equivalent amount in the exercise and control groups. The weight change was -3.5 +/- 0.6 kg/10-point change in diet score (P &lt; 0.0001), similarly within each intervention group, independently of the change in energy intake or baseline age and smoking status. Weight change was attenuated but remained significant after adjustment for intervention group and percentage body fat. Subjects with an increased diet score had more favorable changes in other body size variables, systolic blood pressure, and blood lipid, glucose, insulin, and adiponectin concentrations. Change in diet score was unrelated to resistin and several cytokines. The change toward a more favorable diet pattern was associated with improved body size and metabolic profile.",

    "abstract": "Pioglitazone has a preventive effect on cardiovascular disease, but its ability to stabilize coronary plaque is unknown. A prospective, randomized trial was conducted in 54 patients with type 2 diabetes and stable angina pectoris, randomly assigned to either a pioglitazone group or control group. Non-culprit, angiographically mild-to-moderate obstructive lesions were examined with virtual histology intravascular ultrasound (VH-IVUS) at coronary intervention and 6 months later. In total, 42 lesions of 22 patients in the pioglitazone group and 44 lesions of 24 patients in the control group were analyzed. After 6 months, patients in the pioglitazone group had significantly improved blood sugar, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and plasma adiponectin levels. VH-IVUS analysis revealed that, although the total plaque-to-vessel volume was not changed in either group, the necrotic-core area had significantly decreased in the pioglitazone group (-4.6+/-5.9% vs 1.1+/-9.3%, P=0.001). There was a significant inverse correlation between the change in plasma adiponectin levels and the change in necrotic-core area (r=-0.46, P&lt;0.0001). Pioglitazone may stabilize coronary plaque by reducing the necrotic-core component, in association with enhanced plasma adiponectin levels.",

    "abstract": "To compare the short-term effect of treatment with atorvastatin and rosuvastatin on levels of serum lipids, inflammatory markers and adiponectin in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Sixty-nine patients with hypercholesterolemia were randomly assigned to receive 10 mg/day of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin for 12 weeks. Inflammatory biomarkers, including highsensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and endothelin (ET-1), plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) and plasma tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), adiponectin, and lipid profiles were measured before and after statin therapy. Atorvastatin and rosuvastatin both lowered levels of hs-CRP, MMP-9, PAI-1, total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) from baseline values, with rosuvastatin lowering TC and LDL-C to a greater extent than atorvastatin (P &lt; 0.05). Adiponectin level increase was 15% higher than that at baseline with atorvastatin (P &gt; 0.05) but 67% higher with rosuvastatin (P &lt; 0.05). Therapy with both statins not only significantly improved lipid profiles but also decreased levels of vascular biomarkers hs-CRP, MMP-9, and PAI-1; however, only rosuvastatin increased serum adiponectin levels significantly in patients with hypercholesterolemia, which could imply a beneficial effect in coronary artery disease.",

Thirty-four subjects (17 men and 17 postmenopausal women) were matched for weight and sex and randomly assigned to consume 1 cup raisins per day (RAISIN), increase the amount of steps walked per day (WALK), or a combination of both interventions (RAISIN + WALK). The subjects completed a 2-week run-in period, followed by a 6-week intervention. Ribonucleic acid was extracted from mononuclear cells, and LDL receptor mRNA abundance was quantified by use of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Plasma apolipoproteins were measured by Luminex (Austin, TX) technology. Apoproteins A-1, B, C-II, and E and cholesterol ester transfer protein activity were not altered for any of the groups. In contrast, apolipoprotein C-III was significantly decreased by 12.3% only in the WALK group (P &lt; .05). Low-density lipoprotein receptor mRNA abundance was increased for all groups after the intervention (P &lt; .001). There was a significant group effect for plasma leptin (P = .026). Plasma concentrations increased for RAISIN and RAISIN + WALK. Similarly, plasma ghrelin concentrations were elevated postintervention for both groups consuming raisins (P &lt; .05). These data suggest that walking and raisin consumption decrease plasma LDL cholesterol by up-regulating the LDL receptor and that raisin consumption may reduce hunger and affect dietary intake by altering hormones influencing satiety.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the relationships between plasma leptin and adiponectin levels and recurrent cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke) in men with earlier acute coronary syndromes. A nested case-control study examined circulating leptin and adiponectin levels in plasma obtained 4-6 years after entry into the Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease (LIPID) trial. Plasma was assayed from 184 men who suffered recurrent events within 4.4 years after blood collection and 184 matched controls who remained free of further events. The association between cardiovascular events and the explanatory variables was examined by conditional logistic regression analysis. Relative risk (RR) increased across increasing leptin quartiles; the highest quartile compared with the lowest quartile was related to the highest risk (P for trend=0.002); the increased risk remained after adjustment for risk factors (P=0.018) or for obesity (P=0.038), but in the final model (adjusted for randomized treatment, other drugs, LIPID risk score, age and body mass index), the risk was attenuated (RR=1.61, 95% CI: 0.72-3.57, P for trend=0.34). Adiponectin did not predict cardiovascular events. Subjects randomly allocated to pravastatin had 6% lower leptin levels (P=0.04) than those allocated to placebo.

We compared the effect of two sympatholytic antihypertensive drug treatments, the centrally acting imidazoline receptor-1 agonist moxonidine and peripherally acting beta-blocking agent atenolol on sensitive inflammatory markers in overweight postmenopausal women with diastolic hypertension. This was a multicentre, multinational double-blinded, prospective study comparing moxonidine (0.3 mg twice daily) with atenolol (50 mg once daily) in 87 hypertensive postmenopausal overweight women who were not taking hormone therapy. Sensitive C-reactive protein, IL-6, TNFalpha, TNFalpha-RII and adiponectin were determined in the beginning of the study and after 8 weeks of medical treatment. TNFalpha increased in atenolol and decreased in moxonidine group (P = 0.0004 between the groups). Adiponectin concentration decreased dramatically in atenonol but did not change in moxonidine treatment group (P &lt; 0.0001 between the groups). In logistic regression analysis only treatment group showed an independent effect on changes in adiponectin and TNFalpha concentrations. We believe that centrally acting sympatholytic agent moxonidine is beneficial in the treatment of postmenopausal women with hypertension by reducing inflammatory cytokine TNFalpha without changing protective adiponectin level.",

We studied the effects of protease inhibitor-based antiretroviral regimens on body composition, insulin sensitivity and adipocytokine levels. 48-week substudy of a randomized, open-label, three-arm trial. Hospital and community HIV clinics. 140 HIV-infected adults naive to antiretroviral therapy.

Body composition [dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry for limb fat; L4, abdominal computed tomography for visceral adipose tissue (VAT)]; and fasting metabolic parameters. The primary analysis was change in limb fat mass in each TPV/r group vs. LPV/r. Limb fat increased in all three groups: LPV/r (1.17 kg) versus TPV/r200 (0.83 kg; P = 0.16) and TPV/r100 (0.41 kg; P = 0.07).

No significant change in insulin sensitivity was observed, including by oral glucose tolerance testing. The increase in leptin levels was significantly correlated with the increase in limb fat mass (r = 0.67; P &lt; 0.0001).

    "title": "Losartan elevates the serum high-molecular weight-adiponectin isoform and concurrently improves insulin sensitivity in patients with impaired glucose metabolism.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin is an adipocyte hormone that ameliorates insulin resistance and prevents diabetes. Patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) are at a high risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Since treatment with angiotensin II receptor blockers retards the development of diabetes, the effects of losartan on serum adiponectin levels were examined with regard to insulin sensitivity in pre-diabetic patients. Sixty-five patients with IFG/IGT (42 males, 23 females, 63+/-13 years old) were randomized to receive 25-100 mg of losartan (n=33) or a calcium channel blocker (CCB, n=32) for 3 months. Before and after the treatment, changes in blood pressure, insulin sensitivity (HOMA-R) and serum concentrations of high molecular weight (HMW)-adiponectin and free fatty acid (FFA) were assessed. At baseline, the HMW-adiponectin concentration negatively correlated with the patient's body mass index, HOMA-R and triglyceride levels, and positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels. However, the HMW-adiponectin concentration showed no correlation with blood pressure. HMW-adiponectin concentrations were similar between the losartan group and the CCB group. Both the losartan and CCB treatments similarly and significantly reduced the mean blood pressure (107+/-7 mmHg to 95+/-7 mmHg, p&lt;0.0001, and 104+/-6 mmHg to 93+/-9 mmHg, p&lt;0.0001, respectively). Losartan treatment resulted in a significant increase in HMW-adiponectin concentrations (45.9%) and a significant decrease in HOMA-R (23.9%) and FFA concentrations (26.5%); the percent changes were greater than those induced by CCB treatment (p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.01, respectively). We conclude that losartan increases the serum HMW-adiponectin concentration and concurrently improves insulin sensitivity in subjects with IFG/IGT. These results suggest that losartan may prevent diabetes by increasing serum adiponectin levels.",

Given the high prevalence and prognostic relevance of diastolic myocardial dysfunction in T2DM, we tested the hypothesis that by reducing oxidative stress rosiglitazone, but not glimepiride, may improve diastolic function. This randomised cross-over study investigated 12 metformin-treated T2DM patients without cardiovascular disease before and after 16 weeks of additional therapy with rosiglitazone (8 mg daily) or glimepiride (3 mg daily). Systolic and diastolic myocardial velocity (E') were assessed with tissue Doppler. In spite of similar non-significant lowering of glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1C), rosiglitazone, but not glimepiride, significantly improved E' (p=0.04), reduced malondialdehyde (p=0.028), lowered high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) (p=0.019), and increased adiponectin (p=0.002). For rosiglitazone, multivariate regression analysis revealed malondialdehyde reduction as an independent determinant of treatment-induced improvement in E'. The rosiglitazone-induced improvements of diastolic function and oxidative stress may be of prognostic relevance in choosing therapy for T2DM patients without overt heart disease.",

Low adiponectin and high resistin plasma concentrations are reported to be associated with atherosclerosis. However, it is not known how ERT affects plasma adiponectin and resistin concentrations. Seventy-three hysterectomized, nondiabetic, postmenopausal women were randomized in a double-blind, double-dummy study to receive either peroral estradiol valerate or transdermal 17beta-estradiol gel for 6 months. Biochemical measurements were determined from samples taken before and after the therapy. Peroral estradiol valerate therapy decreased adiponectin concentrations from 13.6 to 11.6 mg/L (P = .008), whereas transdermal 17beta-estradiol gel had no effect (12.7 vs 12.2 mg/L). Neither treatment changed the resistin concentrations significantly. Plasma concentrations of estradiol and estrone did not correlate with adiponectin or resistin concentrations before or after therapy. The change in adiponectin concentration correlated significantly with the changes in waist-hip ratio, very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides, and insulin-like growth factor 1 in the peroral estradiol valerate group. The changes in these variables and the change in estradiol concentration explained 43.1% (P = .001) of the variability in the change of plasma adiponectin, the change in very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides being the strongest determinant (beta = -.407, P = .011). The results show that peroral ERT can decrease plasma adiponectin levels. However, ERT does not seem to influence plasma resistin concentrations.",

    "abstract": "Insulin resistance is a major feature of type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Several studies pointed out the possible role of increased leptin in NAFLD in humans. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of metformin on plasma leptin levels in obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and NAFLD compared with lifestyle interventions. Thirty-four obese patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus were prospectively followed for 6 months. All patients had ultrasonographic evidence of NAFLD at baseline. The patients were randomized into two groups: group 1 (n = 15) followed lifestyle changes only and group 2 (n = 19) received metformin (1,700 mg/day). At the end of treatment, BMI, WHR, HbA1c, fasting glucose, leptin, HOMA-IR, alanine aminotransferase values decreased in both groups. No significant difference in the end-points was observed between two groups. Only in group 2, LDL decreased and HDL increased significantly. Liver echogenity decreased significantly at the end of study in both groups. The percentage of patients who no longer had evidence of NAFLD was not significantly different between the groups (20% of patients on lifestyle intervention vs. 16% of patients on metformin). The data demonstrate that, metformin and lifestyle interventions equally affected the plasma leptin levels, BMI and degree of NAFLD in obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition, the effects of metformin on the variables were not found to be mediated by leptin.",

Subjects initially comprised 153 hypertensive patients (72 men, 81 women; mean age, 67.9 +/- 7.8 years) with diagnosed glucose intolerance on the glucose loading test. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 6-month administration of telmisartan 47.0 mg/d (TEL) or candesartan 8.4 mg/d (CAN), or to have no change in drug regimen (control group, CTL). Fasting plasma glucose level was significantly reduced in TEL (n = 46) compared with CTL (n = 47) (percentage of change from baseline, -1.7% vs +2.2%; P = .045). Percentage of increase in adiponectin was significantly larger in TEL than in CTL (+10.5% vs +2.2%, P = .025), but not significantly larger in CAN (n = 44) than in CTL (+4.9% vs +2.2%; P = .13). Percentage of decrease in body weight from baseline was significantly enhanced in TEL compared with CTL (-2.2% vs -0.8%, P = .023) and CAN (-2.2% vs -0.3%, P = .007). Telmisartan decreased body weight while increasing serum adiponectin levels in hypertensive patients with glucose intolerance. Candesartan did not achieve similar improvements in these patients. Among ARBs, telmisartan may have a larger impact on obesity-related diseases that can lead to cardiovascular disorders.",

    "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) has been associated with cardiovascular disease in epidemiological and observational studies. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the treatment of choice for OSAS, but the impact of this intervention on systemic inflammation involved in the atherosclerotic process remains unclear. 100 men with moderate-severe OSAS were randomised to therapeutic (n = 51) or subtherapeutic (n = 49) CPAP treatment for 4 weeks to investigate the effects of active treatment on inflammatory markers such as highly sensitive C reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin (IL)6, interferon gamma (IFNgamma) and anti-inflammatory adiponectin. 4 weeks of therapeutic CPAP did not significantly change blood levels of hsCRP compared with the subtherapeutic control group (difference between median changes -0.24 mg/l (95% CI -0.88 to +0.24); p = 0.30). Plasma levels of IL6 and IFNgamma did not change significantly following therapeutic compared with subtherapeutic CPAP (difference between median changes +0.52 and -0.07 pg/ml (95% CI -0.72 to +1.94 and -0.81 to +0.44); p = 0.45 and p = 0.82, respectively). Furthermore, 4 weeks of therapeutic CPAP did not significantly change levels of adiponectin in plasma compared with the subtherapeutic control group (difference between median changes +0.05 pg/ml (95% CI -0.36 to +0.47); p = 0.84). If patients with hsCRP values above 8 mg/l at baseline were excluded, differences between the changes in hsCRP, IL6, IFNgamma and adiponectin after 4 weeks of CPAP were smaller, and again not statistically different between groups. 4 weeks of CPAP treatment has no beneficial effect on blood markers of inflammation and adiponectin in patients with moderate-severe obstructive sleep apnoea.",

    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a leading cause of chronic liver disease for which there is limited therapy available. Insulin sensitizing, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic properties of thiazolidinediones support their use in treating NASH. We have evaluated pioglitazone in the treatment of nondiabetic patients with NASH. We randomized 74 nondiabetic patients (45 men; median age, 54 y) with histologically proven NASH to 12 months of standard diet, exercise, and either placebo or pioglitazone (30 mg/day). Sixty-one patients (30 placebo, 31 pioglitazone) had liver biopsies both at the beginning and the end of the study. Compared with placebo, pioglitazone therapy was associated with an increase in weight (mean change, -0.55 vs +2.77 kg; P = .04) and a reduction in glucose (+0.4 vs -0.1 mmol/L; P = .02), HbA1c (+0.16% vs -0.18%; P = .006), insulin C peptide level (+42 vs -78 pmol/L; P = .02), alanine aminotransferase level (-10.9 vs -36.2 u/L; P = .009), gamma-glutamyltransferase level (-9.4 vs -41.2 u/L; P = .002), and ferritin (-11.3 vs -90.5 microg/L; P = .01). Histologic features including hepatocellular injury (P = .005), Mallory-Denk bodies (P = .004), and fibrosis (P = .05) were reduced in patients treated with pioglitazone compared with those in the placebo group. Pioglitazone therapy over a 12-month period in nondiabetic subjects with NASH resulted in improvements in metabolic and histologic parameters, most notably liver injury and fibrosis. Larger extended trials are justified to assess the long-term efficacy of pioglitazone in this patient group.",

    "abstract": "There is controversy about the effects of statins on plasma adiponectin, and the impact of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on plasma adiponectin level is still unknown. We investigated the impact of Atorvastatin on plasma adiponectin levels in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients with stable angina and normal lipid profiles after PCI. Sixty CAD patients with stable angina and normal lipid profiles scheduled for PCI, and not on statins, were randomly assigned to either no treatment (control group) or the Atorvastatin treatment (Atorvastatin group). Atorvastatin administration was started immediately after PCI. Blood samples were obtained immediately after PCI and again 3 and 6 mo later. Fasting plasma adiponectin concentrations were measured using a radioimmunoassay kit. After PCI, there were statistically significant decreases in adiponectin levels in the Atorvastatin group at 3 and 6 mo (8.66 +/- 0.69 versus 6.87 +/- 0.55 and 7.12 +/- 0.71 microg/mL at 0, 3, and 6 mo, respectively), despite the anti-inflammation and lipid-lowering effects of Atorvastatin. There were no statistically significant changes in adiponectin levels in the control group. There was significant positive association between baseline plasma adiponectin and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. Changes of adiponectin level were not associated with the changes of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and lipid profiles in the Atorvastatin group. Our study confirmed the benefits of Atorvastatin on anti-inflammation and anti-atherosclerosis, but we also found that Atorvastatin had a negative effect on the adiponectin system. The anti-inflammatory, anti-atherogenic effects of Atorvastatin are not affected by decreased adiponectin levels.",

    "abstract": "The large clinical trials proved that Basal-Bolus (BB) insulin therapy was effective in the prevention of diabetic complications and their progression. However, BB therapy needs multiple insulin injections per a day. In this regard, a biphasic insulin analogue needs only twice-daily injections, and is able to correct postprandial hyperglycemia. Therefore it may achieve the blood glucose control as same as that of BB therapy and prevent the diabetic complications including macroangiopathy. In PROBE (Prospective, Randomized, Open, Blinded-Endpoint) design, forty-two type 2 diabetic patients (male: 73.8%, median(inter quartile range) age: 64.5(56.8-71.0)years) with secondary failure of sulfonylurea (SU) were randomly assigned to BB therapy with a thrice-daily insulin aspart and once-daily basal insulin (BB group) or to conventional therapy with a twice-daily biphasic insulin analogue (30 Mix group), and were followed up for 6 months to compare changes in HbA1c, daily glycemic profile, intima-media thickness (IMT) of carotid artery, adiponectin levels, amounts of insulin used, and QOL between the two groups. After 6 months, HbA1c was significantly reduced in both groups compared to baseline (30 Mix; 9.3(8.1-11.3) --&gt; 7.4(6.9-8.7)%, p &lt; 0.01, vs BB;8.9(7.7-10.0) --&gt; 6.9(6.2-7.3)%, p &lt; 0.01), with no significant difference between the groups in percentage change in HbA1c (30 Mix; -14.7(-32.5- (-)7.5)% vs BB -17.8(-30.1- (-)11.1)%, p = 0.32). There was a significant decrease in daily glycemic profile at all points except dinner time in both groups compared to baseline. There was a significant increase in the amount of insulin used in the 30 Mix group after treatment compared to baseline (30 Mix;0.30(0.17-0.44) --&gt; 0.39(0.31-0.42) IU/kg, p = 0.01). There was no significant difference in IMT, BMI, QOL or adiponectin levels in either group compared to baseline. Both BB and 30 mix group produced comparable reductions in HbA1c in type 2 diabetic patients with secondary failure. There was no significant change in IMT as an indicator of early atherosclerotic changes between the two groups. The basal-bolus insulin therapy may not be necessarily needed if the type 2 diabetic patients have become secondary failure. Current Controlled Trials number, NCT00348231.",

    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a liver disease that complicates insulin-resistant states. This trial tested the efficacy and safety of rosiglitazone, an insulin-sensitizing agent, in patients with NASH. Sixty-three patients with histologically proven NASH were randomly assigned to receive rosiglitazone (4 mg/day for the first month and 8 mg/day thereafter; n = 32) or placebo (n = 31) for 1 year. Liver biopsy was performed at the end of treatment. End points were improvement in the histologic score of steatosis, normalization of serum transaminase levels, and improvement in necroinflammation and fibrosis. More patients treated with rosiglitazone than receiving placebo had improved steatosis (47% vs 16%; P = .014) and normalized transaminase levels (38% vs 7%; P = .005), although only half of patients responded. There was no improvement in other histologic lesions, including fibrosis, and a composite score of activity, the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score. Improvement of steatosis correlated with reduction of transaminase levels (r = 0.36; P &lt; .005), improvement in insulin sensitivity (r = 0.34; P = .008), and increase in adiponectin levels (r = -0.54; P &lt; .01) but not with weight variations. Independent predictors of response were rosiglitazone treatment, the absence of diabetes, and massive steatosis. Weight gain was the main adverse effect (mean gain of 1.5 kg in the rosiglitazone group vs -1 kg in the placebo group; P &lt; .01), and painful swollen legs was the main reason for dose reduction/discontinuation. Serum hemoglobin level was slightly but significantly reduced. There was no hepatic toxicity. In patients with NASH, rosiglitazone improves steatosis and transaminase levels despite weight gain, an effect related to an improvement in insulin sensitivity. However, there is no improvement in other parameters of liver injury.",

    "abstract": "Long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA) lower risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), but mechanisms are not well understood. We used proteomics to identify human serum proteins that are altered by n-3 LCPUFA. Such proteins could identify pathways whereby they affect CHD. Eighty-one healthy volunteers entered a double blind randomised trial to receive 3.5 g of fish oil or 3.5 g of high oleic sunflower oil daily. Serum was collected before and after 6 wk of intervention. Serum was analysed by proteomics using 2-DE. Proteins that were differentially regulated were identified by MS. We also analysed serum apolipoprotein A1 (apo A1), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particle size and haptoglobin. Serum levels of apo A1, apo L1, zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein, haptoglobin precursor, alpha-1-antitrypsin precursor, antithrombin III-like protein, serum amyloid P component and haemopexin were significantly downregulated (all p&lt;0.05) by fish oil compared with high oleic sunflower oil supplementation. Fish oil supplementation caused a significant shift towards the larger, more cholesterol-rich HDL(2) particle. The alterations in serum proteins and HDL size imply that fish oil activates anti-inflammatory and lipid modulating mechanisms believed to impede the early onset of CHD. These proteins are potential diagnostic biomarkers to assess the mechanisms whereby fish oil protects against CHD in humans.",

    "abstract": "We have reported that, compared with glucose-sweetened beverages, consuming fructose-sweetened beverages with meals results in lower 24-h circulating glucose, insulin, and leptin concentrations and elevated triacylglycerol (TG). However, pure fructose and glucose are not commonly used as sweeteners. High-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) has replaced sucrose as the predominant sweetener in beverages in the United States. We compared the metabolic/endocrine effects of HFCS with sucrose and, in a subset of subjects, with pure fructose and glucose. Thirty-four men and women consumed 3 isocaloric meals with either sucrose- or HFCS-sweetened beverages, and blood samples were collected over 24 h. Eight of the male subjects were also studied when fructose- or glucose-sweetened beverages were consumed. In 34 subjects, 24-h glucose, insulin, leptin, ghrelin, and TG profiles were similar between days that sucrose or HFCS was consumed. Postprandial TG excursions after HFCS or sucrose were larger in men than in women. In the men in whom the effects of 4 sweeteners were compared, the 24-h glucose and insulin responses induced by HFCS and sucrose were intermediate between the lower responses during consumption of fructose and the higher responses during glucose. Unexpectedly, postprandial TG profiles after HFCS or sucrose were not intermediate but comparably high as after pure fructose. Sucrose and HFCS do not have substantially different short-term endocrine/metabolic effects. In male subjects, short-term consumption of sucrose and HFCS resulted in postprandial TG responses comparable to those induced by fructose.",

    "abstract": "Several randomized clinical trials have suggested that atorvastatin and pravastatin may differ in terms of their pleiotropic effects. To verify this, we compared the effects of both statins on glucose tolerance, adipokine concentrations and inflammatory markers. A total of 36 hypercholesterolaemic patients without known coronary heart disease (CHD) were enrolled in an open-label, randomized, crossover study. The patients received pravastatin or atorvastatin (10 mg/day) for 4 months and then switched to the other statin for an additional 4 months. At the end of both treatment periods, atorvastatin significantly reduced the concentration of serum lipids (total and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and triglycerides) and inflammatory markers (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and tumour necrosis factor-a) and increased serum adiponectin levels compared with pravastatin treatment. Although these effects would be expected to improve insulin sensitivity, atorvastatin did not affect glucose tolerance, which was assessed by fasting glucose and insulin concentrations, the homeostasis model assessment index and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) levels. Only obese patients showed increased HbA(1c) levels after atorvastatin treatment. Our results suggest that atorvastatin has both advantages and disadvantages compared with pravastatin treatment. Further studies are required to compare the relative clinical value of atorvastatin and pravastatin, especially in obese patients without CHD.",

    "abstract": "Physical activity is associated with improved fibrinolytic activity and reduced risk for cardiovascular disease. High levels of leptin and low levels of adiponectin, both adipocyte-derived hormones, or adipokines, are related to dysfibrinolysis and risk for cardiovascular disease. In this study, we explored if improved fibrinolytic activity during exercise could be linked to changes in leptin and adiponectin levels. Twenty healthy men (mean age 36 years) participated in a 14-day long skiing expedition in the Swedish mountains. They were randomly assigned to either a 40% or a 30% fat-based diet. Anthropometry, lipids, fibrinolytic activity (PAI-1 activity, tPA activity and mass) and adipokines (leptin and adiponectin) were measured before, during and six weeks after the expedition. PAI-1 activity and circulating levels of leptin decreased whereas levels of adiponectin increased during exercise. The fall in PAI-1 activity showed a strong linear association with changes in leptin and adiponectin levels (p = 0.001 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively). Changes in leptin and adiponectin levels were independent of decreasing waist circumference. However, the association between anthropometric measures and adipokines changed considerably during the expedition. Adiponectin was weakly and negatively associated with BMI at baseline. In contrast, there was a strong positive association between adiponectin and BMI after two weeks of exercise, whereas the association between leptin and BMI became less pronounced. In addition, increasing leptin and decreasing adiponectin levels were associated with increasing PAI-1 activity during the six weeks following the expedition. After six weeks of normal activity, fibrinolytic activity and hormone levels returned towards baseline levels. Heavy exercise induced improved fibrinolytic activity, which was associated independently with changes in circulating levels of the adipocyte-derived hormones leptin and adiponectin. Improved fibrinolytic activity (and reduced risk for cardiovascular disease) related to physical activity could possibly be mediated by leptin and adiponectin.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin can suppress atherogenesis by inhibiting the adherence of monocytes, reducing their phagocytic activity, and suppressing the accumulation of modified lipoproteins in the vascular wall. Contradictory data have been reported about the effect of statins on adiponectin plasma levels. In this work, adiponectin plasma levels were measured in 102 statin-free subjects from the Spanish population of the Achieve Cholesterol Targets Fast with Atorvastatin Stratified Titration (ACTFAST) study, a 12-week, prospective, multi-centre, open-label trial which enrolled subjects with coronary heart disease, coronary heart disease-equivalent or a 10-year coronary heart disease risk &gt;20%. Subjects were assigned to atorvastatin (10-80 mg/day) based on low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol concentration at screening. For comparison, age and gender-matched blood donors (N=40) were used as controls. Control subjects did not present hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and history of cardiovascular diseases. Adiponectin levels were diminished in patients at high cardiovascular risk compared with control subjects [4166 (3661-4740) vs 5806 (4764-7075) ng/ml respectively; geometric mean (95% CI); P&lt;0.0001]. In the whole population, atorvastatin treatment increased adiponectin levels [9.7 (3.2-16.7);% Change (95% CI); P=0.003]. This increment was in a dose-dependent manner; maximal effect observed with atorvastatin 80 mg/d [24.7 (5.7-47.1); P=0.01]. Adiponectin concentrations were positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol both before and after atorvastatin treatment. No association was observed between adiponectin and LDL-cholesterol before and after atorvastatin treatment. In conclusion, atorvastatin increased adiponectin plasma levels in subjects at high cardiovascular risk, revealing a novel anti-inflammatory effect of this drug.",

    "title": "Including indigestible carbohydrates in the evening meal of healthy subjects improves glucose tolerance, lowers inflammatory markers, and increases satiety after a subsequent standardized breakfast.",
    "abstract": "Low-glycemic index (GI) foods and foods rich in whole grain are associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We studied the effect of cereal-based bread evening meals (50 g available starch), varying in GI and content of indigestible carbohydrates, on glucose tolerance and related variables after a subsequent standardized breakfast in healthy subjects (n = 15). At breakfast, blood was sampled for 3 h for analysis of blood glucose, serum insulin, serum FFA, serum triacylglycerides, plasma glucagon, plasma gastric-inhibitory peptide, plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), serum interleukin (IL)-6, serum IL-8, and plasma adiponectin. Satiety was subjectively rated after breakfast and the gastric emptying rate (GER) was determined using paracetamol as a marker. Breath hydrogen was measured as an indicator of colonic fermentation. Evening meals with barley kernel based bread (ordinary, high-amylose- or beta-glucan-rich genotypes) or an evening meal with white wheat flour bread (WWB) enriched with a mixture of barley fiber and resistant starch improved glucose tolerance at the subsequent breakfast compared with unsupplemented WWB (P &lt; 0.05). At breakfast, the glucose response was inversely correlated with colonic fermentation (r = -0.25; P &lt; 0.05) and GLP-1 (r = -0.26; P &lt; 0.05) and positively correlated with FFA (r = 0.37; P &lt; 0.001). IL-6 was lower (P &lt; 0.01) and adiponectin was higher (P &lt; 0.05) at breakfast following an evening meal with barley-kernel bread compared with WWB. Breath hydrogen correlated positively with satiety (r = 0.27; P &lt; 0.01) and inversely with GER (r = -0.23; P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, the composition of indigestible carbohydrates of the evening meal may affect glycemic excursions and related metabolic risk variables at breakfast through a mechanism involving colonic fermentation. The results provide evidence for a link between gut microbial metabolism and key factors associated with insulin resistance.",

    "title": "Plasma adiponectin levels and clinical outcomes among haemodialysis patients.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin (ADPN) levels are consistently elevated among patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, but its relationship with cardiovascular outcomes in this population remains controversial. We measured baseline and yearly plasma ADPN in 182 prevalent haemodialysis patients recruited to the Haemodialysis (HEMO) Study from two Boston centres. Plasma ADPN at baseline and during follow-up was studied in relation to prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Baseline plasma ADPN levels were found to be approximately twofold higher than in the general population and correlated inversely with (log-transformed) CRP levels and (log-transformed) body mass index (BMI). Levels measured over time showed a gradual increase (0.95 microg/mL, 95% CI = 0.12-1.78 microg/mL; P = 0.03) by year, although this difference became non-significant after adjustment for covariates. Baseline ADPN levels were lower among patients with pre-existing CVD (adjusted OR of 0.67; P = 0.03). They also predicted all-cause mortality (P &lt; 0.01) and the composite outcome of 'cardiovascular events/cardiovascular mortality' (P &lt; 0.01); levels measured over time predicted the composite outcome of 'cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality' (P &lt; 0.01). These relationships were non-linear (quadratic) with the hazard for each outcome increasing in the lower and upper ranges of the distribution of ADPN, and strengthened after adjustment for baseline covariates including serum albumin, CVD and the flux and dialysis dose categorization of the HEMO study. In summary, low plasma levels of ADPN were associated with inflammation and pre-existing CVD; ADPN levels predicted cardiovascular and mortality outcomes, the relationship being extensively confounded by multiple patient-related factors.",

    "abstract": "The effects of a very-low-carbohydrate, high-saturated-fat weight-loss diet (LC) on brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and markers of endothelial function are unknown. The effect of an LC on markers of endothelial function and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk was compared with that of an isocaloric high-carbohydrate, low-saturated-fat diet (HC). FMD and markers of endothelial function (n = 70) and CVD risk were measured before and after 8 wk of weight loss. Ninety-nine subjects aged 50.0 +/- 8.3 y with a body mass index (in kg/m2) of 33.7 +/- 4.1 completed the study. Mean (+/-SD) FMD did not change significantly (P = 0.55) with either diet. Pulse wave velocity improved with both diets (P &lt; 0.01). Endothelial markers, E- and P selectin, intracellular and cellular-adhesion molecule-1, tissue-type plasminogen activator, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 decreased (P &lt; 0.001), with no diet effect. Adiponectin did not change significantly. More weight (P = 0.05 for diet x time interaction) and more abdominal fat mass (P = 0.05 for diet x time interaction) were lost with the LC than with the HC. LDL cholesterol decreased more with the HC than with the LC (P &lt; 0.05, time x diet), and C-reactive protein decreased more with the HC than with the LC (P &lt; 0.05 for diet x time interaction). Homocysteine increased more with the LC (P &lt; 0.01 for diet x time interaction). Folate decreased with the LC and increased with the HC (P &lt; 0.05, time; P &lt; 0.001 for diet x time interaction). An LC does not impair FMD. We observed beneficial effects of both diets on most of the CVD risk factors measured. This trial was registered with the Australian Clinical Trials Registry as ACTR N0 12606000203550.",

    "abstract": "Type II diabetes mellitus is currently globally one of the fastest growing non-communicable diseases, especially in developing countries. This investigation reports on a meta-analysis undertaken of the C-11377G locus within the adiponectin gene in a black South African, a Cuban Hispanic and a German Caucasian cohort. Genotyping was performed via a real-time PCR strategy. Both fixed- and random-effects models were tested to describe the diabetes risk at both the cohort and population levels. The 2,2 genotype may only be associated with increased diabetes risk in the Cuban Hispanic cohort. Population-specific effects may have masked these associations upon meta-analytical analysis, as no significant odds ratio could be determined. Thus, to examine diabetes risk, a more global approach including the design of population-specific experimental strategies should be used, which will be crucial in developing health education and policies in a global health programme.",

    "abstract": "Impaired exercise capacity, adiponectin, MMPs and TIMPs have all been implicated in the development of cardiovascular disease. The aim of our study was to determine the effects of rosiglitazone on these factors in diabetic patients. Seventy individuals with Type 2 diabetes were assigned randomly to either a rosiglitazone group (8 mg/day, RG) or a control group (CG) for 6 months. All participants took gliclazide 160 mg plus metformin 1700 mg in stable dose. None of the individuals had diabetic complications or had previously participated in an exercise programme. Anthropometric parameters, VO2 peak, oxygen pulse, glycaemic indices, lipid profile, adiponectin, insulin resistance, blood pressure and serum MMP-9, TIMP-1, TIMP-2 levels were assessed at baseline and at the end of the study. After Bonferroni adjustment, a P-value &lt; 0.017 was assumed to be statistically significant. Rosiglitazone treatment significantly increased VO2 peak (P &lt; 0.0001), the duration of the exercise test (P &lt; 0.0001), oxygen pulse (P = 0.010) and TIMP-2 levels (P = 0.008) in comparison with CG. Insulin resistance, hyperglycaemia, diastolic blood pressure and MMP-9 levels were also reduced (P &lt; 0.017). Fat mass, lipid profile, TIMP-1 levels and MMP9 : TIMP-1 ratio were unaltered after rosiglitazone treatment. There were no significant changes in these parameters in control subjects. In univariate analysis, the rosiglitazone-induced increment of VO2 peak was associated with alterations in plasma adiponectin (r = 0.691), HOMA-IR (r = -0.782) and HbA(1c) (r = -0.676) (P &lt; 0.017). These relationships retained significance after multiple regression analysis (P = 0.005). Rosiglitazone treatment increases cardiorespiratory fitness and modulates favourably serum adiponectin, MMP-9 and TIMP-2 levels. Whether these effects produce cardiovascular benefits in the long term requires further investigation.",

    "title": "Effects of low- and high-flux dialyzers on oxidative stress and insulin resistance.",
    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The cornerstone of high CVD incidence in ESRD patients is endothelial dysfunction which results from inflammation, oxidative stress and insulin resistance. Although various modalities of hemodialysis (HD) have been presumed to exert different effects on oxidative stress and insulin resistance, solid evidence is still lacking. 40 ESRD patients undergoing HD were prospectively enrolled and divided randomly into two groups. Patients in each group received either F8 HPS (low-flux) (Group A) or FX80 (high-flux) (Group B) as HD dialyzers for 2 consecutive months. Diet pattern and medications were kept as usual in both groups to avoid considerable blood glucose change during study period. Blood samples were taken at the start and end of the study. A total of 38 patients (18 and 20 for Groups A and B, respectively) completed the study. Within each group, there was no change in adiponectin, plasma 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2)(alpha), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, blood glucose and insulin after 2 months of treatment except a significant change of HOMA(IR) (p = 0.02) in high-flux group. The significant change of HOMA(IR) between the two groups (p = 0.017) mainly results from the parallel change of insulin between the two groups (p = 0.03). For patients receiving HD, the high-flux dialyzer with synthetic polysulfone membranes fails to provide a better anti-inflammatory or antioxidative effect than the low-flux dialyzer; however, the high-flux dialyzer does significantly improve insulin resistance in this short-term study. This result implies that the high-flux dialyzer might provide better cardiovascular protection than the low-flux dialyzer. Therefore, the low-flux dialyzer might be considered for patients who only need short-term HD therapy. Regarding patients under long-term maintenance HD therapy, a high-flux dialyzer might be the choice of dialyzer.",

The aim of this systematic review is to assess the body of evidence critically for the effects of exercise on adiponectin levels. Literature searches using the Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane Controlled Trials registry, EMBASE, and SportDiscus databases were conducted from 1966 to September 2006 using keywords pertaining to adiponectin and exercise. Thirty-three trials met the inclusion criteria. Study designs consisted of 5 cross-sectional studies, 7 trials of acute exercise, 11 uncontrolled trials, 2 non-randomized controlled trials, and 8 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Exercise of varying prescription has been shown to increase serum adiponectin in 38% of RCTs, demonstrating small-to-moderate effect sizes (ESs). One study reported a dose-response effect of resistance training intensity and the augmentation of adiponectin. Inconsistent support in the literature exists for increasing adiponectin levels after short-term exposure to robust aerobic or resistance training of moderate-to-high intensities. Particular attention should be directed toward high-risk cohorts, in whom augmentation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine adiponectin may assume critical importance.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the effects of alterations in fatty acid classes on adiponectin, a hormone secreted by the adipocyte known to be important in the development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Any factor, including diet, that may positively influence adiponectin gene expression or increase circulating levels might be useful for improving such metabolic abnormalities. We investigated the effects of alterations in dietary fatty acid saturation on fasting serum adiponectin and associated peptides. Double-blind, randomized, crossover, 2 x 3-week residential intervention trial where 18 mildly hyperlipidemic adult men were provided with a high saturated:unsaturated fat (SFA:USFA) and lower SFA:USFA treatment separated by an uncontrolled 4-week washout. Only fatty acid profile was altered between treatments. Fasting blood samples were collected on days 0, 1, 7, 14, 21, 22 of each intervention period for the measurement of adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsC-RP), leptin, and ghrelin. Body weight was kept constant (+/-1 kg) throughout each treatment. There was no detectable difference in fasting adiponectin at baseline (mean day 0 + day 1) between the treatment groups (mean +/- s.d.; high(SFA:USFA) = 7.0 +/- 1.7 vs. low(SFA:USFA) = 6.7 +/- 1.4 microg/ml, P &gt; 0.05). There were neither significant between-treatment effects of fatty acid saturation (diet x time, P &gt; 0.05) on serum adiponectin nor any significant between-treatment effects on serum TNF-alpha, IL-6, hsC-RP, leptin, or ghrelin (P &gt; 0.05). Fasting serum adiponectin was not detectably affected by alterations in dietary fatty acid profile in mildly hyperlipidemic men. There was no evidence that an increase in SFA content of the diet significantly worsened fasting serum adiponectin over a 3-week intervention period.",

    "abstract": "Polymorphisms of the adipose most abundant transcript 1 gene (apM1) may be closely associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as described in several recent publications. In the present study, a meta-analysis was performed to quantitatively analyse the association of apM1 polymorphisms with T2DM using previous case-control studies in Chinese populations. Several electronic databases were searched for relevant articles up to January 2007. After data collection and gene loci selection, a meta-analysis was performed to assess heterogeneity, combine results and evaluate variations. Publication bias was examined by the Egger's linear regression test and fail-safe number for P = 0.05 (Nfs(0.05)). Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) test and different effect models were employed for the sensitivity analysis. The meta-analysis for this study included 2379 subjects from nine studies. The distribution of SNP45TG + GG and SNP276GG polymorphisms of the apM1 was analysed. Results of these experiments revealed a significant association between the SNP45TG + GG and SNP276GG polymorphisms of apM1 with T2DM in Chinese populations (P &lt; or = 0.05). There was some heterogeneity in the SNP45TG + GG apM1 among these studies. The odds ratio (OR) of apM1 genotype SNP45TG + GG in T2DM was 1.59 when compared with controls (95% CI, 1.00-2.53, P = 0.05), and the OR for the wild-apM1 genotype SNP276GG in T2DM was 1.26 (95% CI, 1.00-1.59, P = 0.05). The publication bias diagnostics and sensitivity analysis confirmed the reliability and stability of this meta-analysis. This apM1 polymorphism was found to be strongly associated with T2DM, and the SNP45TG + GG and SNP276GG forms of the apM1 increased risk for T2DM in Chinese populations.",

All the subjects were follow-up for 8 weeks. The arterial elasticity was determined by CVProfilor DO-2020 and expressed as elasticity indexes (C(1)-large artery and C(2)-small artery). During the follow-up, totally nine cases were dropped out (three cases from the fish oil group and six cases from the placebo group). After 8 weeks follow-up, the large artery elasticity in the fish oil group, compared with its baseline, was significantly improved (C(1): 15.5+/-1.5 vs 12.8+/-3.7 ml mm Hg(-1) x 10), whereas no effects were found in the placebo group (C(1): 13.0+/-3.4 vs 13.4+/-3.8 ml mm Hg(-1) x 10), P=0.027, RM-ANOVA across the two groups. The small artery elasticity (C(2)), BP and pulse pressure were not found any changes, either in the fish oil group or in the placebo group. At same time, the serum soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1(sVCAM-1) and leptin levels, the lipid profile and insulin sensitivity index (ISI) as well, did not show significant differences between two groups. Fish oil supplementation certainly would improve large arterial elasticity but no effect on BP in overweight hypertensive patients.

    "title": "Effect of selective and non-selective beta-blockers on body weight, insulin resistance and leptin concentration in chronic heart failure.",
    "abstract": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) is characterized by increased insulin resistance and hyperleptinaemia. We aimed to study effects of selective and non-selective beta-blockers on body weight, insulin resistance, plasma concentrations of leptin and resistin in patients with CHF. Twenty-six non-cachectic beta-blocker-naive patients with CHF were randomized and treated with either carvedilol or bisoprolol. Body weight, plasma concentrations of leptin, resistin, fasting glucose and insulin were measured at baseline and after 6 months of therapy. Insulin resistance was estimated by homeostasis model assessment- estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Body weight increased significantly in the carvedilol group (mean change + 2.30 kg, p = 0.023) while it did not change in the bisoprolol group (mean change -0.30 kg, p = 0.623) (ns between groups). Plasma leptin concentration increased only in the carvedilol group (mean change + 4.20 ng/ml, p = 0.019) (ns between groups). Fasting glucose and resistin remained unchanged in both groups. After 6 months, mean plasma insulin concentration changed significantly differently (p = 0.015) in the bisoprolol (mean change +3.1 microU/ml) compared to the carvedilol group (mean change -6.3 microU/ml) and HOMA-IR was consequently higher in the bisoprolol compared to the carvedilol group (5.2 +/- 4.2 vs 2.8 +/- 1.6, p = 0.046). This study found different metabolic effects of carvedilol and bisoprolol in non-cachectic patients with CHF. With unchanged fasting plasma glucose concentration after 6 months of treatment, carvedilol significantly decreased plasma insulin concentration and insulin resistance compared to bisoprolol.",

    "abstract": "C1q tumor necrosis factor (TNF) related proteins 9 (CTRP9) is a novel adipocytokine that has been shown to have a cardioprotective effect in coronary artery disease (CAD). However, there are conflicting results on circulating levels of CTRP9 in patients with and without CAD. This meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the association between circulating CTRP9 levels and CAD. The aim of this meta-analysis was to re-examine the relationship between circulating CTRP9 levels and CAD. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang Data, and CBM for relevant studies up to October 2023, and 193 articles were identified. After reading the title, abstract and full text, a total of 25 articles were included in this meta-analysis. A prespecified protocol registered at INPLASY was followed (INPLASY202450066). Due to the high heterogeneity, we performed subgroup analyses and meta-regression based on patient characteristics, complications, clinical biochemical indicators, coronary artery lesion, and CAD classification. Publication bias was assessed using Egger's linear regression tests, Begg's rank correlation tests, and funnel plots. The results showed that the patient with CAD had significantly lower circulating CTRP9 levels than the control group (Z = 3.26, P = 0.001). Subgroup analysis and meta-regression findings demonstrated that observed heterogeneity could be attributed to population distribution. Patient characteristics (year of publication, patients' age, and BMI), complications (diabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)), clinical biochemical indicators, coronary artery lesion (stability of coronary atherosclerotic plaque, and the number of diseased coronary vessels), and classification of CAD were not identified as source of heterogeneity. The meta-analysis confirmed that circulating CTRP9 levels in CAD patients are significantly lower than those in patients without CAD. The association may be modified by the population distribution.",

The following PICO structure was utilized: Population (patients with ALS); Intervention (serum concentrations of ghrelin, leptin, and adiponectin), Comparison (with or without controls), and Outcome (ALS progression). the risk of bias of selected papers was assessed through the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) tool. 11 out of 240 papers were selected for this study which were published between 2010 and 2024. Lower serum leptin concentrations were detected in the ALS compared to control groups (WMD: -0.91, 95% CI:-1.77, -0.05). Serum concentrations of adiponectin were higher in ALS compared to control groups (WMD: 0.41, 95% CI:-0.7, 0.89). Ultimately, The serum concentrations of ghrelin in the ALS groups were lower than control groups (WMD: -1.21, 95% CI: -2.95, 0.53). Our findings revealed that serum concentrations of ghrelin and leptin were higher in ALS patients compared to control, unlike adiponectin.",

    "abstract": "Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a common cause of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), has been recently regarded as a metabolic disease. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of metabolic disarrangements, including insulin resistance, obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, and it has been established that these components of MetS are important contributing factors exacerbating the degree of prostatic enlargement and bladder outlet obstruction among patients with BPH. Clinical and experimental studies demonstrated that many molecules, such as insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), androgen and estrogen, and adipokines, are involved in the overlapping pathogenesis of BPH and MetS, indicating that clinicians might be able to simultaneously alleviate or cure two diseases by choosing appropriate medications. This article aims to systematically review the pathophysiological aspect and traditional etiology and pathogenesis of BPH and discuss the intricate association between MetS and BPH from the molecular point of view, in an attempt to provide stronger evidence for better treatment of two diseases.",

    "title": "Adiponectin as a biomarker in liver cirrhosis-A systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin, a key adipokine, shows promise as a non-invasive biomarker for liver cirrhosis by reflecting inflammation and metabolic changes, but conflicting findings highlight the need for a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify its role. Our study aimed to evaluate adiponectin levels across various stages of liver cirrhosis, compare them with other chronic liver diseases (CLD) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and assess its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker. Our systematic search was conducted on September 2023 using PubMed, EMBASE and Scopus, searching for observational studies evaluating serum and plasma adiponectin levels in liver cirrhosis. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, and study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. To evaluate the overall effect size, we utilized a random-effects model along with a mean difference (MD) analysis. The principal summary outcome was the MD in adiponectin levels. We included 16 articles involving 2617 subjects in our qualitative and quantitative synthesis. We found significantly higher adiponectin levels in liver cirrhosis patients (8.181 [95% CI 3.676, 12.686]), especially in Child-Pugh B individuals (13.294 [95% CI 4.955, 21.634]), compared to controls. Child-Pugh A patients did not show significant differences compared to controls. In addition, adiponectin levels were significantly elevated in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) patients compared to controls (8.669 [95% CI .291, 17.047]), as well as in liver cirrhosis compared to other CLD patients (4.805 [95% CI 1.247, 8.363]), including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (8.532 [95% CI 3.422, 13.641]), but not viral hepatitis. No significant MD was observed between liver cirrhosis and HCC patients. Adiponectin levels are significantly elevated in liver cirrhosis, especially in advanced stages, potentially serving as a biomarker for advanced cirrhosis. Adiponectin also differentiates cirrhosis from other CLD, including NAFLD. However, its role in distinguishing cirrhosis from viral hepatitis and HCC is limited.",

    "title": "Effect of Time-Restricted Eating on Circulating Levels of IGF1 and Its Binding Proteins in Obesity: An Exploratory Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial.",
    "abstract": "Obesity is associated with alterations in circulating IGF1, IGF1-binding proteins (IGFBPs), insulin, inflammatory markers, and hormones implicated in cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and aging. However, the effects of 4 and 6 h time-restricted eating (TRE) on circulating IGF1 and IGFBPs is uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the effects of TRE on plasma IGF1, IGFBP1, IGFBP2, and IGFBP3, and whether these effects were mediated by weight loss or body composition changes. Insulin sensitivity, glucose control, adipokines, and inflammatory markers were also examined. An exploratory analysis of an 8-week randomized controlled trial implementing a daily TRE intervention was carried out. This study was conducted at the University of Illinois at Chicago in 2019. Participants with obesity were randomized to 4 or 6 h TRE (n = 35) or a control (n = 14) group. Plasma biomarkers were measured by ELISA at baseline and week 8. In a sub-analysis, participants were stratified into higher- (&gt;3.5%) and lower- (&#x2264;3.5%) weight-loss groups. Participants fasted daily from 7 p.m. to 3 p.m. in the 4 h TRE group (20 h) and from 7 p.m. to 1 p.m. in the 6 h TRE group (18 h), followed by ad libitum eating for the remainder of the day. Controls received no dietary recommendations. IGF1, IGFBPs, hsCRP, and adipokines were the main outcome measures of this analysis. Repeated measures ANOVA and mediation analysis were conducted. Body weight significantly decreased with TRE (-3.6 &#xb1; 0.3%), contrasting with controls (+0.2 &#xb1; 0.5%, p &lt; 0.001). Significant effects of TRE over time were observed on plasma IGFBP2, insulin, HOMA-IR, and 8-isoprostane levels, without affecting other biomarkers. In the sub-analysis, IGFBP2 increased while leptin and 8-isoprostane decreased significantly only in the higher weight loss subgroup. Changes in insulin and HOMA-IR were related to TRE adherence. Eight-week daily 4 to 6 h TRE did not affect IGF1, IGFBP1, or IGFBP3 levels but improved insulin, HOMA-IR, and 8-isoprostane. IGFBP2 increased and leptin decreased when weight loss exceeded 3.5% of baseline.",

    "abstract": "Caloric overfeeding combined with adequate protein intake increases not only body fat mass but also fat-free mass. However, it remains unclear whether the increase in fat-free mass due to overfeeding is associated with an increase in total body protein mass. We evaluated the hypothesis that overfeeding would promote an increase in total body protein mass. In our randomized controlled trial, 23 healthy young men were fed a diet equivalent to their energy requirements with a&#xa0;+10&#xa0;% energy surplus from protein alone or a&#xa0;+40&#xa0;% energy surplus (+10&#xa0;% from protein,&#xa0;+30&#xa0;% from carbohydrate) for 6 weeks. We estimated total body protein mass by a four-compartment model using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, deuterium dilution, and hydrostatic underwater weighing. The 40&#xa0;% energy surplus over 6 weeks significantly increased body protein mass compared to baseline by 3.7&#xa0;% (0.44&#xa0;kg; 95&#xa0;% confidence interval [CI], 0.21-0.67&#xa0;kg; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.003); however, the 10&#xa0;% energy surplus did not result in a significant change (0.00&#xa0;kg; 95&#xa0;% CI,&#xa0;-0.38-0.39&#xa0;kg; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.980). A significant interaction between intervention duration (time) and energy surplus (group) was observed for total body protein mass (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.035, linear mixed-effects model), with a trend toward a significant difference in total body protein mass gain between groups (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.059, Wilcoxon rank sum test). The increase in body protein mass due to the energy surplus was correlated with an increase in fat mass (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.820, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.002). A higher energy intake was found to promote an increase in body protein mass in healthy men consuming excess protein, suggesting the importance of energy surplus in body protein accumulation. This effect of energy surplus may be related to factors such as increased body fat mass and the associated secretion of adipokines. The trial was registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trial Registry as UMIN000034158.",

    "abstract": "Ginseng, with various pharmacological activities, has received increasing attention to improve cardiovascular health (CVH). Therefore, this meta-analysis synthesized the effect of ginseng consumption on biomarkers of CVH in adults. A systematic search was performed in the databases of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library through July 24, 2023 to screen out English-language randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of ginseng consumption on body composition, blood pressure, vascular stiffness, lipid metabolism, glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, inflammatory cytokines, and adipocytokines in adults. The weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to evaluate the overall effect size, and STATA 12.0 was used for comprehensive analysis. Forty-five studies were included in the meta-analysis. Ginseng consumption significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP) (WMD&#x2009;=&#x2009;-2.57&#x2009;mmHg, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;-4.99 to -0.14, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.038), total cholesterol (TC) (WMD&#x2009;=&#x2009;-4.40&#x2009;mg/dL, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;-8.67 to -0.132, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.043), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (WMD&#x2009;=&#x2009;-2.81&#x2009;mg/dL, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;-4.89 to -0.72, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008), C-reactive protein (CRP) (WMD&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.41&#x2009;mg/L, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.73 to -0.10, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.010), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (WMD&#x2009;=&#x2009;-2.82&#x2009;pg./mL, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;-4.31 to -1.32, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Subgroup analyses suggested that supplementation with ginseng for less than 12&#x2009;weeks significantly reduced SBP, but 12&#x2009;weeks or more improved TC and CRP. Ginseng consumption on SBP, TC, and CRP seemed to be more effective on unhealthy participants. The meta-analysis showed that ginseng consumption might have the potential to improve SBP, TC, LDL-C, CRP, and IL-6. These findings suggest that ginseng is a potential candidate for the maintenance of CVH. However, our results had high heterogeneity. Future high-quality studies are needed to firmly establish the clinical efficacy of ginseng consumption.",

    "abstract": "Leptin is a reliable predictive and surrogate marker of the efficacy of multitargeted treatment of cancer cachexia. To the best of our knowledge, no study has assessed the predictive role of biomarkers in establishing the effectiveness of anti-cachectic treatment, which remains a complex issue. Herein, we aimed to find a marker that can detect early response to anti-cachectic treatment. From January 2012 to December 2022, all consecutive eligible advanced cancer patients with cachexia were prospectively enrolled in an exploratory and validation cohort according to eligibility criteria. All patients received a combined anti-cachectic treatment consisting of megestrol acetate plus celecoxib plus l-carnitine plus antioxidants that showed efficacy in a previous phase III randomized study. Primary endpoints were an increase in lean body mass (LBM), a decrease in resting energy expenditure (REE), a decrease in fatigue, and improvement in global quality of life. A total of 553 consecutive patients were recruited. Twenty patients dropped out, equally distributed over the exploratory (11 patients) and validation (9 patients) cohorts, for early death due to disease progression. Then, 533 patients were deemed assessable. Leptin level changes inversely correlated with circulating levels of inflammatory mediators and reflected the improvement of body composition, energy metabolism, functional performance, and quality of life. At multivariate regression analysis, at week 8, leptin change was an independent predictor of LBM, skeletal muscle index (SMI), grip strength increase, and REE; at week 16, leptin change was an independent predictor of the same parameters and improvement in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status. The ability of leptin to predict changes in LBM, SMI, REE, and grip strength was superior to that of other inflammatory markers when comparing the receiver operating curves. Moreover, increasing delta leptin values were associated with significantly better outcomes in LBM, SMI, REE, grip strength, and fatigue. Leptin is a reliable predictive marker for multitargeted anti-cachectic treatment outcomes. Thus, it can be an ideal candidate for monitoring and predicting the effects of anti-cachectic treatment and a surrogate marker of the immune-metabolic actions of the selected drugs.",

Key themes identified in the analysis included molecular processes, new organokines, skeletal muscle research, model organism studies, and human studies based on sex and age differences. The study highlighted the growing interest in the molecular mechanisms of obesity and role of myokines. Results showed a substantial increase in publications from 2014 to 2024, with a focus on new organokines (myokines, adipokines) and animal models. The analysis underscored the importance of myokines in modulating metabolic processes and their potential therapeutic implications in managing non-communicable diseases such as obesity. Furthermore, the study revealed the close relationship between exercise, myokine production, and regulation of metabolism, stress response, and inflammation. In conclusion, over the last years, increasing research interest has been focused on the molecular mechanisms of obesity and benefits of exercise, and probably will be focused on a set of myokines released during muscle contraction. A newly identified myokines has emerged as a promising marker for the prevention and control of obesity.",

    "title": "A systematic review and meta-analysis investigating differences in chronic inflammation and adiposity before and after menopause.",
    "abstract": "Menopause represents a pivotal physiological transition characterized by hormonal fluctuations and an augmented susceptibility to chronic diseases. The relationship between menopause and heightened disease risk may be attributed in part to alterations in low-grade chronic inflammation and adiposity. Three databases were searched for studies assessing differences in inflammation and body adiposity between pre- and postmenopausal women. Meta-analysis examined the association between menopausal status and key inflammatory biomarkers, including leptin, adiponectin, interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor-&#x3b1; and c-reactive protein, and indices of body adiposity (fat mass, waist circumference, waist-to-hip-ratio and body mass index). The National Institute of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Observational and Cross-sectional studies was used to evaluate quality of studies, and GRADE-assessed evidence certainty. Levels of adiponectin and leptin were higher in postmenopausal women than in premenopausal women [(1.30&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/ml, 95&#xa0;% CI; 0.56 to 2.03&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/ml, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.001), (0.88&#xa0;ng/ml; 95&#xa0;% CI: 0.22 to 1.52; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.008)]. A trend towards significance was observed for tumour necrosis factor-&#x3b1; (0.59&#xa0;pg/ml, 95&#xa0;% CI; -0.07 to 1.26&#xa0;pg/ml, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.080), with no significant differences in interleukin-6 and c-reactive protein [(0.83&#xa0;pg/ml, 95&#xa0;% CI; -0.24 to 1.91&#xa0;pg/ml, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.128), (0.06&#xa0;mg/ml, 95&#xa0;% CI; -0.17 to 0.29, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.606)]. Postmenopausal women had greater waist circumference, waist-to-hip-ratio and body mass index than premenopausal women [(0.74&#xa0;cm; 95&#xa0;% CI: 1.02 to 0.47; p&#xa0;&#x2264;0.001), (0.78; 95&#xa0;% CI: 1.47 to -0.09; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.027), (0.31&#xa0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>; 95&#xa0;% CI: 0.50 to 0.12; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.001)]. Postmenopausal women had higher adipokine levels and greater adiposity. However, given the low certainty of the available evidence, future prospective cohort studies assessing inflammatory changes over the menopausal transition are warranted to inform future clinical decisions.

    "title": "Recurrent depression predicts high leptin concentrations in patients with coronary artery disease over an 18-months follow-up period: Findings from the prospective multicenter randomized controlled SPIRR-CAD Trial.",
    "abstract": "Leptin, an adipokine suspected to play a role in coronary artery disease (CAD), may also be associated with deteriorated mental health. We investigated the prospective impact of recurrent depressed mood (RDM) on heightened plasma leptin levels in CAD patients. Derived from the randomized SPIRR-CAD trial, plasma leptin were measured by the Human Leptin DuoSet ELISA at baseline in 539 patients (including 115 (21.3&#xa0;%) women and 424 (78.7&#xa0;%) men) and in 373 participants after 18-months follow up (T3). RDM was based on the clinical course from baseline to follow-up assessed by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). Multivariate binary logistic regression models identified predictors for heightened leptin at T3. At baseline, highest leptin level (3rd tertile) was associated with type 2 diabetes (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.009), heart failure symptoms (NYHA III) (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001), female sex and BMI &#x2265;30 (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) but not with age and depression. At study endpoint (T3), RDM was associated with a substantially increased risk of experiencing the highest plasma leptin level (OR 2.92 (95&#xa0;% CI 1.27-6.75)) followed by increased NT-proBNP (the most prominent indicator of CHF) with an OR of 2.73 (1.22-6.11) - both after adjustment for concurrent factors including weight gain (diff BMI T3-T1) over the study period - the latter accounting for an OR of 1.41 (1.17-1.70). Findings are limited to people of Caucasian ancestry which prevents being generalized to other ethnicities. Although relying upon a prospective design, reverse causality cannot be excluded but is unlikely. In CAD patients, RDM is a significant predictor of heightened leptin -a finding opening room for a new pathway of the psychobiological underpinning of depression on CAD risk.",

    "abstract": "To estimate the association between maternal metformin use for the treatment of early gestational or pre-existing type 2 diabetes and preterm preeclampsia. This is a planned secondary analysis of the MOMPOD study (Medical Optimization of Management of Overt Type 2 Diabetes in Pregnancy), a randomized trial comparing the effect of adding metformin with insulin treatment on composite neonatal outcome in singleton pregnancies with early gestational or type 2 diabetes. Participants were randomized at 11-23 weeks of gestation to 1,000 mg metformin twice daily or placebo until delivery. A subset of participants had maternal blood collected at 24-30 weeks of gestation, and serum soluble endoglin, apolipoprotein B, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1, placental growth factor, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, adiponectin, and vascular endothelial growth factor levels were measured. Our primary outcome was preterm preeclampsia , defined as preeclampsia requiring delivery before 37 weeks of gestation. Secondary outcomes included preterm preeclampsia requiring delivery before 34 weeks of gestation and differences in serum biomarkers. Multivariable regression analysis was used to estimate the associations between metformin use and primary or secondary study outcomes. Of 831 participants, 119 (14.3%) developed preeclampsia requiring delivery before 37 weeks of gestation: 57 of 416 (13.7%) in the placebo group and 62 of 415 (14.9%) in the metformin group. Thirty-seven (4.4%) developed preeclampsia requiring delivery before 34 weeks of gestation: 15 (3.6%) receiving placebo and 22 (5.3%) receiving metformin. Compared with placebo, metformin was not associated with a significant difference in the occurrence of preeclampsia before 37 weeks of gestation (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.04, 95% CI, 0.70-1.56) or before 34 weeks (aOR 1.43, 95% CI, 0.73-2.81). Similarly, there was no association between maternal metformin use and serum biomarker levels. Among parturients with early gestational or pre-existing type 2 diabetes, the addition of metformin to insulin was not associated with lower odds of preterm preeclampsia or with serum biomarkers associated with cardiovascular disease risk.",

    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Recent studies have focused on the association between the risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and the rs1501299 and rs2241766 polymorphisms of the ADIPOQ gene; however, their results remain inconclusive. Thus, a systematic review and meta-analysis were carried out to clarify the role of these polymorphisms in the development of DR. Materials and Methods: A systematic search of electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library) was conducted until 25 June 2024, and a reference list of relevant articles was collected, which explored the association between the rs1501299 and rs2241766 polymorphisms of the ADIPOQ gene and the risk of DR. The pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated via random-effects model, and the meta-analysis was implemented by using Review Manager 5.4. Results: In total, 6 out of 182 studies, with 1888 cases (DR) and 2285 controls (without DR), were included in the meta-analysis. A statistically significant association between the rs1501299 polymorphism and the DR risk was recorded in G vs. T in the overall analysis (OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.72-0.99, p = &lt;0.05, I<sup>2</sup> = 23%, n = 5 studies). Additionally, the summary results in the subgroup analysis according to the control type were as follows: the DR versus diabetes mellitus (DM) control type revealed a statistically significant association in G vs. T: OR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.67-0.97, p = &lt;0.05, I<sup>2</sup> = 27%, n = 4 studies; GG vs. GT: OR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.53-0.98, p = &lt;0.05, I<sup>2</sup> = 49%, n = 4 studies; GG vs. (GT + TT): OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.55-0.96, p = &lt;0.05, I<sup>2</sup> = 44%, n = 4 studies. No significant association was observed between the rs2241766 polymorphism and the DR risk. Conclusions: The current meta-analysis supports the association between the rs1501299 polymorphism of the ADIPOQ gene and the DR risk in patients with DM.",

    "abstract": "Weight regain after metabolic bariatric surgery is a common problem. Food addiction is an eating disorder that can be one of the reasons for weight regain in these patients. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of probiotic supplementation with a weight loss program and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on anthropometric measures, eating behavior, food addiction, and related hormone levels, in patients with food addiction and weight regain after metabolic bariatric surgery. This randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted on patients with food addiction and weight regain after metabolic bariatric surgery. Participants (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;50) received a weight loss program and CBT plus probiotic, or placebo for 12&#xa0;weeks. Then, anthropometric measurements, biochemical markers, eating behavior, and food addiction were assessed. Weight and body mass index (BMI) decreased significantly in the probiotic group compared to placebo (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001, respectively). Fat mass was significantly decreased in the probiotic group (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Moreover, a significant improvement was observed in the probiotic group's eating behavior and food addiction compared to the placebo group (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Serum levels of leptin decreased significantly (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02), and oxytocin serum levels increased significantly (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008) in the probiotic group compared to the placebo group. Adding probiotic supplements to the weight loss program and CBT is superior to the weight loss program and CBT alone in improving weight loss, eating behavior, and food addiction in patients with food addiction and weight regain after metabolic bariatric surgery.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to clarify the inconclusive findings from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) by comprehensively evaluating the effects of nonsoy legumes consumption on serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers and Adiponectin. The search encompassed databases up to January 2024, including PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane CENTRAL to retrieve all RCTs examining the effects of nonsoy legumes on inflammatory biomarkers or Adiponectin. The effect sizes quantified as mean differences (MD) and standard deviations (SD) of outcomes, and an overall effect estimate was derived using a random-effects model. RCTs examining serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-&#x3b1;), Interleukin-1&#x3b2; (IL-1&#x3b2;), and Adiponectin were included in the final meta-analysis. Results revealed that consumption of nonsoy legumes increased Adiponectin serum levels (P=.0017) and reduced IL-1&#x3b2; serum levels (P&lt;.0001). However, it may not significantly affect CRP (P=.2951), IL-6 (P=.2286), and TNF-&#x3b1; (P=.6661) levels. Subgroup analyses showed that nonsoy legumes consumption significantly decreased TNF-&#x3b1; serum levels in studies involving healthy participants. Additionally, sensitivity analysis using the leave-one-out method suggested a potential significant reduction in serum levels of IL-6.

    "abstract": "Obesity is a common metabolic disease characterized by abnormal fat accumulation. It contributes to health issues, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and dyslipidemia, necessitating continuous management through diet and physical activity. Probiotics, particularly Bifidobacterium lactis IDCC 4301 (B. lactis Fit&#x2122;), have shown promise in positively regulating the gut microbiota. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the anti-obesity effect of B. lactis IDCC 4301 (B. lactis Fit&#x2122;) in obese women. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm study was performed in 99 volunteers with a body mass index (BMI) of 25-30 kg m<sup>-2</sup>. The participants were randomly assigned to probiotics (n = 49, &gt;5.0 &#xd7; 10<sup>9</sup> CFU day<sup>-1</sup>) or placebo (n = 50) groups. Body fat, lipid profiles, and adipokine levels were assessed at baseline and at 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, changes in total fat (placebo -0.16 &#xb1; 0.83 kg; probiotics -0.45 &#xb1; 0.83 kg; p = 0.0407), trunk fat (placebo -0.03 &#xb1; 0.50 kg; probiotics -0.22 &#xb1; 0.51 kg; p = 0.0200), and serum triglyceride concentration (placebo 13 &#xb1; 60 mg dL<sup>-1</sup>; probiotics -15 &#xb1; 62 mg dL<sup>-1</sup>; p = 0.0088) were significantly different between the groups. The difference in total fat mass change between groups among postmenopausal women was greater than that of all women. A significant positive correlation was found between the change in total fat mass and log leptin/adiponectin ratio (R = 0.371, p = 0.0112) in the probiotics group. In addition, BMI (26.6 &#xb1; 1.9 kg m<sup>-2</sup> to 26.4 &#xb1; 2.0 kg m<sup>-2</sup>, p = 0.0009) and leg fat (42 &#xb1; 5% to 41 &#xb1; 5%, p = 0.0006) significantly decreased in the probiotics group after 12 weeks, but there was no difference in the placebo group. In conclusion, B. lactis IDCC 4301 (B. lactis Fit&#x2122;) may be associated with body fat loss through changes in metabolic health parameters, such as serum triglyceride and adipokine levels.

    "title": "Beneficial effects of a new probiotic formulation on adipocytokines, appetite-regulating hormones, and metabolic parameters in obese women.",
    "abstract": "Obesity is often accompanied by low-grade chronic inflammation and metabolic syndrome. It has been established that microbiota influences many physiological processes, including the development of obesity, and dysbiosis has been observed in obese individuals. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of a new probiotic formulation, containing two probiotic strains and the bioactive compound octacosanol, on body weight, metabolic parameters, and concentrations of certain adipocytokines and appetite-regulating hormones in obese women. This double blind placebo-controlled supplementary intervention study included twenty-five women in the intervention group and twenty-three in the placebo group, and it lasted 12 weeks. Daily oral supplementation included 7 &#xd7; 10<sup>10</sup> CFU of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 299v (DSM9843), 5 &#xd7; 10<sup>9</sup> CFU of Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. boulardii (DBVPG6763), and 40 mg of octacosanol or placebo. Body weight, metabolic parameters, adipocytokines, and appetite-regulating hormones were assessed before (T0) and after the intervention (T1). After the intervention, significantly lower median concentrations of CRP (p = 0.005) and IL-6 (p = 0.012) were measured in the intervention group than the baseline, while the median concentrations of ghrelin (p = 0.026) and HDL-cholesterol (p = 0.03) were significantly increased. The intervention group had lower CRP levels (p = 0.023) and higher ghrelin levels (p = 0.006) than the placebo group. Significant changes in BMI between groups were not observed. In summary, although the new probiotic formulation showed beneficial effects on IL-6, CRP, HDL, and ghrelin levels, its potential effects on regulating triglyceride, insulin, and glucose levels require further studies before the novel dietary intervention could be considered a useful adjuvant therapy and an effective strategy for the management of obesity and obesity-associated comorbidities.",

    "title": "Altered leptin level in autism spectrum disorder and meta-analysis of adipokines.",
    "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that leptin is involved in the pathology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this study, our objective was to investigate the levels of leptin in the blood of children with ASD and to examine the overall profile of adipokine markers in ASD through meta-analysis. Leptin concentrations were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit, while adipokine profiling, including leptin, was performed via meta-analysis. Original reports that included measurements of peripheral adipokines in ASD patients and healthy controls (HCs) were collected from databases such as Web of Science, PubMed, and Cochrane Library. These studies were collected from September 2022 to September 2023 and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Standardized mean differences were calculated using a random effects model for the meta-analysis. Additionally, we performed meta-regression and explored heterogeneity among studies. Our findings revealed a significant increase in leptin levels in children with ASD compared to HCs (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0319). This result was consistent with the findings obtained from the meta-analysis (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Furthermore, progranulin concentrations were significantly reduced in children with ASD. However, for the other five adipokines analyzed, there were no significant differences observed between the&#xa0;children with ASD and HCs children. Heterogeneity was found among the studies, and the meta-regression analysis indicated that publication year and latitude might influence the results of the meta-analysis. These findings provide compelling evidence that leptin levels are increased in children with ASD compared to healthy controls, suggesting a potential mechanism involving adipokines, particularly leptin, in the pathogenesis of ASD. These results contribute to a better understanding of the pathology of ASD and provide new insights for future investigations.",

    "title": "Inflammatory markers as diagnostic and precision nutrition tools for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease: Results from the Fatty Liver in Obesity trial.",
    "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a growing public health concern. The disease is silent, and its diagnosis is often delayed. Inflammatory markers constitute an interesting tool to act as subrogate, non-invasive markers. This study aimed to evaluate the changes of inflammatory markers throughout a two-year dietary intervention in subjects presenting MASLD, to determine which of the markers are suitable to predict the disease, and act as a customizing tool for MASLD's dietary treatment. Ninety-eight subjects with MASLD and forty-five controls from the Fatty Liver in Obesity (FLiO) Study were analyzed. MASLD was diagnosed and graded by ultrasound. The MASLD subjects were randomly assigned to two different dietary strategies, the American Heart Association (AHA diet) or a dietary strategy based on the Mediterranean pattern, which was specially designed for the study (FLiO diet), and then followed for two years. Hepatic status was additionally assessed through Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), elastography, and determination of transaminases. Inflammatory markers improved throughout the intervention in the MASLD subjects and managed to reach similar levels to controls, especially at 6 and 12 months. Additionally, leptin, adiponectin, M30, and LECT2 managed to significantly diagnose the disease at all time marks of the intervention, making them candidates for subrogate non-invasive markers of the disease. Moreover, baseline chemerin, leptin, LECT2, and M65 were used to build a predictive score to achieve greater weight loss, and therefore, which strategy could be more useful for MASLD 's treatment. The predictive score was significantly able assign a specific diet to 55% of the study participants, meaning that the remaining 45% could achieve the same amount of weight loss following either diet equally. Inflammatory markers constitute a potential non-invasive tool to be used in MASLD screening and could also constitute an interesting tool for MASLD's treatment customization, being able to predict the effectiveness of a dietary strategy based on the initial inflammatory state of each subject. www. gov (NCT03183193).",

    "title": "Combined Aerobic and Resistance Training Improves Body Composition, Alters Cardiometabolic Risk, and Ameliorates Cancer-Related Indicators in Breast Cancer Patients and Survivors with Overweight/Obesity: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.",
    "abstract": "Breast cancer survivors with obesity are at a high risk of cancer recurrence, comorbidity, and mortality. This review aims to systematically evaluate the effects of combined aerobic and resistance training (CART) on body composition, lipid homeostasis, inflammation, adipokines, cancer-related fatigue, sleep, and quality of life in breast cancer patients and survivors with overweight/obesity. An electronic search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Science Direct, Cochrane, and Google Scholar databases from inception up to January 8, 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) meeting the inclusion criteria were selected for the analysis. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess eligible studies, and the GRADE method to evaluate the quality of evidence. A random-effects model was used, and data were analyzed using mean (MD) and standardized mean differences (SMD) for continuous variables with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the data for risk of bias, heterogeneity, sensitivity, reporting bias, and quality of evidence. A total of 17 randomized controlled trials were included in the systematic review involving 1,148 female patients and survivors (mean age: 54.0 &#xb1; 3.4 years). The primary outcomes showed significant improvements in body mass index (SMD -0.57 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, p = 0.04), body fat (SMD -0.50%, p = 0.02), fat mass (SMD -0.63 kg, p = 0.04), hip circumference (MD -3.14 cm, p = 0.02), and fat-free mass (SMD 1.03 kg, p &lt; 0.001). The secondary outcomes indicated significant increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD -0.05 mmol/L, p = 0.008), natural killer cells (SMD 0.42%, p = 0.04), reductions in triglycerides (MD -81.90 mg/dL, p &lt; 0.01), total cholesterol (SMD -0.95 mmol/L, p &lt; 0.01), tumor necrosis factor &#x3b1; (SMD -0.89 pg/mL, p = 0.03), and leptin (SMD -0.63 ng/mL, p = 0.03). Also, beneficial alterations were found in cancer-related fatigue (SMD -0.98, p = 0.03), sleep (SMD -1.17, p &lt; 0.001), and quality of life (SMD 2.94, p = 0.02) scores. There was very low to low confidence in the estimated effect of most of the outcomes. The present findings reveal that CART could be considered an adjunct therapy in supporting the conventional clinical approach observed following exercise. However, further high-quality research is needed to evaluate whether CART would be a valuable intervention to lower aggressive pharmacologic use in breast cancer patients with overweight/obesity.",

    "title": "Effects of germinated brown rice and germinated black rice on people with type 2 diabetes mellitus combined with dyslipidaemia.",
    "abstract": "Objective: This study aimed to observe the effects of germinated brown rice and germinated black rice on blood lipid levels, blood glucose levels and lipid metabolism-related enzymes in T2DM patients with dyslipidaemia and to study their effects on the gut microbiome and short-chain fatty acids. Methods: According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 68 subjects were randomly divided into a germinated brown rice group, a germinated black rice group and a white rice group. At the end of the intervention, relevant anthropometric indices, blood biochemistry, and levels of adipokines and lipid metabolism-related enzymes were measured. Faecal samples were collected for 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing and for an analysis of short-chain fatty acids. Results: After 3 months of intervention with germinated brown rice, germinated black rice or white rice, 21 people in each group completed the intervention as required. At the end of the intervention, the levels of total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the germinated brown rice group and germinated black rice group were significantly lower than those in the white rice group. The levels of adiponectin (ADPN) and lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) in the germinated brown rice group were significantly higher than those in the white rice group (P &lt; 0.05). At the genus level, interventions with germinated brown rice and germinated black rice significantly increased the relative abundance of Megamonas, Muribaculaceae and Alloprevotella and significantly decreased the relative abundance of Veillonella (P &lt; 0.05). After 3 months of intervention, a significant decrease in waist circumference was observed within the germinated brown rice group compared to that at baseline (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: Compared with the consumption of white rice, the consumption of germinated brown rice and germinated black rice can effectively regulate the glucose and lipid metabolism of this population. In addition, interventions involving the use of germinated brown rice and germinated black rice may further improve intestinal diversity and abundance, increase the relative abundance of Megamonas and decrease the relative abundance of Veillonella.",

    "abstract": "A randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effect of a Mediterranean-style diet on vascular health indices such as endothelial function indices, serum lipid and ceramide plasma and some adipokine serum levels. We recruited all consecutive patients at high risk of cardiovascular diseases admitted to the Internal Medicine and Stroke Care ward at the University Hospital of Palermo between September 2017 and December 2020. The enrolled subjects, after the evaluation of the degree of adherence to a dietary regimen of the Mediterranean-style diet, were randomised to a Mediterranean Diet (group A) assessing the adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet at each follow up visit (every three months) for the entire duration of the study (twelve months) and to a Low-fat diet (group B) with a dietary counselling starting every three months for the entire duration of the study (twelve months).The aims of the study were to evaluate: the effects of adherence to Mediterranean Diet on some surrogate markers of vascular damage, such as endothelial function measured by means of the reactive hyperaemia index (RHI) and augmentation index (AIX), at the 6-(T1) and 12-month (T2) follow-ups; the effects of adherence to Mediterranean Diet on the lipidaemic profile and on serum levels of ceramides at T1 and T2 follow-ups; the effects of adherence to Mediterranean Diet on serum levels of visfatin, adiponectin and resistin at the 6- and 12-month follow-ups. A total of 101 patients were randomised to a Mediterranean Diet style and 52 control subjects were randomised to a low-fat diet with a dietary counselling. At the six-month follow-up (T1), subjects in the Mediterranean Diet group showed significantly lower mean serum total cholesterol levels, and significantly higher increase in reactive hyperaemia index (RHI) values compared to the low-fat diet group. Patients in the Mediterranean Diet group also showed lower serum levels of resistin and visfatin at the six-month follow-up compared to the control group, as well as higher values &#x200b;&#x200b;of adiponectin, lower values of C24:0, higher values of C22:0 and higher values of the C24:0/C16:0 ratio. At the twelve-month follow-up (T2), subjects in the Mediterranean Diet group showed lower serum total cholesterol levels and lower serum LDL cholesterol levels than those in the control group. At the twelve-month follow-up, we also observed a further significant increase in the mean RHI in the Mediterranean Diet group, lower serum levels of resistin and visfatin, lower values of C24:0 and of C:18:0,and higher values of the C24:0/C16:0 ratio. The findings of our current study offer a further possible explanation with regard to the beneficial effects of a higher degree of adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet on multiple cardiovascular risk factors and the underlying mechanisms of atherosclerosis. Moreover, these findings provide an additional plausible interpretation of the results from observational and cohort studies linking high adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet with lower total mortality and a decrease in cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality.

    "abstract": "DNA methylation influences gene expression and function in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Mapping of T2DM-associated DNA methylation could aid early detection and/or therapeutic treatment options for diabetics. A systematic literature search for associations between T2DM and DNA methylation was performed. Prospero registration ID: CRD42020140436. PubMed and ScienceDirect databases were searched (till October 19, 2023). Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and New Castle Ottawa scale were used for reporting the selection and quality of the studies, respectively. Thirty-two articles were selected. Four of 130 differentially methylated genes in blood, adipose, liver or pancreatic islets (TXNIP, ABCG1, PPARGC1A, PTPRN2) were reported in&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;1 study. TXNIP was hypomethylated in diabetic blood across ethnicities. Gene enrichment analysis of the differentially methylated genes highlighted relevant disease pathways (T2DM, type 1 diabetes and adipocytokine signaling). Three prospective studies reported association of methylation in IGFBP2, MSI2, FTO, TXNIP, SREBF1, PHOSPHO1, SOCS3 and ABCG1 in blood at baseline with incident T2DM/hyperglycemia. Sex-specific differential methylation was reported only for HOOK2 in visceral adipose tissue (female diabetics: hypermethylated, male diabetics: hypomethylated). Gene expression was inversely associated with methylation status in 8 studies, in genes including ABCG1 (blood), S100A4 (adipose tissue), PER2 (pancreatic islets), PDGFA (liver) and PPARGC1A (skeletal muscle). This review summarizes available evidence for using DNA methylation patterns to unravel T2DM pathophysiology. Further validation studies in diverse populations will set the stage for utilizing this knowledge for identifying early diagnostic markers and novel druggable pathways.",

Lactiplantibacillus plantarum SKO-001, a probiotic strain isolated from Angelica gigas, has been reported to reduce obesity by controlling the gut microbiome. In this double-blind, randomised clinical trial, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SKO-001 in reducing body fat. We included 100 participants randomised into SKO-001 or placebo groups (1:1) for 12 weeks. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to objectively evaluate body fat reduction. Body fat percentage (p = 0.016), body fat mass (p = 0.02), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels (p = 0.025), and adiponectin levels (p = 0.023) were lower in the SKO-001 group than in the placebo group after 12 weeks of SKO-001 consumption. In the SKO-001 group, the subcutaneous fat area (p = 0.003), total cholesterol levels (p = 0.003), and leptin levels (p = 0.014) significantly decreased after 12 weeks of SKO-001 consumption compared with baseline values. Additionally, SKO-001 did not cause any severe adverse reactions. In conclusion, SKO-001 is safe and effective for reducing body fat and has the potential for further clinical testing in humans.",

Meta-regression analysis revealed that the obesity definition (body mass index (BMI) cut-off value &gt;25 or &gt;30) was significant for serum resistin (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.05) and GCF resistin (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.05) between group 1 and 2. The current analysis indicates that both periodontitis and obesity can modulate the pro-inflammatory cytokines at systemic and local levels. This bidirectional interaction of periodontitis and obesity via the inflammation pathway seems likely plausible. Further studies are required to elucidate this mechanism in more detail.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this meta-analysis was to quantify the overall effects of gene mutations in the leptin-melanocortin pathway on short- and long-term weight loss after bariatric surgery. MEDLINE, PubMed, and Embase were searched, and data were analyzed using ReviewManager (RevMan) version 5.4. The datasets were divided into two subgroups based on postoperative time, and the outcome measure was the percentage of total weight loss. Meta-regression analysis was performed, and the outcome was presented as the weighed mean difference of percentage of total weight loss. The results showed that patients with mutations in the leptin-melanocortin pathway experienced 3.03% lower total weight loss after bariatric surgery (mean difference, -3.03; 95% CI: -3.63 to -2.44), mainly reflected in lower long-term postoperative weight loss (mean difference, -3.43; 95% CI: -4.09 to -2.77), whereas mutation carriers exhibited a magnitude of short-term postoperative weight loss that was similar to patients without such mutations (total difference value, -1.13; 95% CI: -2.57 to 0.31). Mutations in leptin-melanocortin pathway genes reduce long-term weight loss after bariatric surgery, whereas this effect may not be reflected during the period of rapid weight loss within 12&#x2009;months. These genetic variants increase the difficulties in maintaining patients' long-term weight loss.",

    "title": "Association between visfatin and periodontitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by bacterial infection in the periodontal support tissue. Visfatin, a hormone secreted mainly by adipocytes and macrophages, plays an important role in immune regulation and defense. Although studies have indicated that patients with periodontitis have significantly high serum and gingival crevicular fluid levels of visfatin, the relationship between this adipocytokine and periodontal disease remains unclear. The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the association between visfatin levels and periodontitis. The PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, EBSCO, and Wiley Online Library databases were searched for potential studies, using periodontitis and visfatin as the keywords in the title and abstract search fields. Standardized mean difference (SMD) values with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined from the results of this meta-analysis. In total, 22 articles involving 456 patients with periodontitis and 394 healthy individuals (controls) were included in the meta-analysis. Visfatin levels were significantly higher in the patients with periodontitis than in the healthy individuals (SMD: 3.82, 95% CI [3.01-4.63]). Moreover, the visfatin levels were significantly lowered after periodontitis treatment (SMD: -2.29, 95% CI [-3.33 to -1.26]). This first-ever meta-analysis comparing visfatin levels between patients with periodontitis and healthy individuals suggests that this adipocytokine can be a diagnostic and therapeutic biomarker for periodontal disease.",

    "title": "Circulatory resistin levels in inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is a chronic relapsing-remitting systemic disease of the gastrointestinal tract with rising incidence. Studies have shown that adipocytes play a crucial role in patients with IBD by actively participating in systemic immune responses. The present study was designed to investigate the correlation between the circulatory levels of resistin, as an adipokine, and active and remission phases of IBD in comparison with healthy controls. Relevant articles were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, the Web of Science, and Scopus from inception until June 2023. Estimation of the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for comparison of plasma/serum resistin levels between IBD patients, patients in remission, and healthy controls were conducted through random-effect meta-analysis. A total of 19 studies were included, assessing 1836 cases. Meta-analysis indicated that generally, serum/plasma resistin levels were higher in IBD patients in comparison with healthy controls (SMD 1.33, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.08, p-value&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). This was true for each of the UC and CD separate analyses, as well. Moreover, it was shown that higher serum/plasma resistin levels were detected in the active phase of IBD than in the remission phase (SMD 1.04, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.42, p-value&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01). Finally, higher serum/plasma resistin levels were found in the remission phase compared to healthy controls (SMD 0.60, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.06, p-value&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis support the conclusion that circulating resistin levels are increased in IBD (both UC and CD). Also, higher resistin levels were recorded in the remission phase of IBD in comparison with healthy controls. This indicates that further studies may provide valuable insights into the role of resistin in the pathogenesis of IBD.",

    "abstract": "Biallelic pathogenic leptin gene variants cause severe early-onset obesity usually associated with low or undetectable circulating leptin levels. Recently, variants have been described resulting in secreted mutant forms of the hormone leptin with either biologically inactive or antagonistic properties. We conducted a systematic literature research supplemented by unpublished data from patients at our center as well as new in vitro analyses to provide a systematic classification of congenital leptin deficiency based on the molecular and functional characteristics of the underlying leptin variants and investigated the correlation of disease subtype with severity of the clinical phenotype. A total of 28 distinct homozygous leptin variants were identified in 148 patients. The identified variants can be divided into 3 different subtypes of congenital leptin deficiency: classical hormone deficiency (21 variants in 128 patients), biologically inactive hormone (3 variants in 12 patients), and antagonistic hormone (3 variants in 7 patients). Only 1 variant (n = 1 patient) remained unclassified. Patients with biological inactive leptin have a higher percentage of 95th body mass index percentile compared to patients with classical hormone deficiency. While patients with both classical hormone deficiency and biological inactive hormone can be treated with the same starting dose of metreleptin, patients with antagonistic hormone need a variant-tailored treatment approach to overcome the antagonistic properties of the variant leptin. Categorization of leptin variants based on molecular and functional characteristics helps to determine the most adequate approach to treatment of patients with congenital leptin deficiency.",

    "abstract": "Postmenopausal women with obesity are markedly at risk of cognitive impairment and several health issues. Emerging evidence demonstrated that both diet and exercise, particularly physical-cognitive exercise are involved in cognitive and health benefits. However, the comparative effect of diet, exercise, and combined interventions in postmenopausal women with obesity on cognition and cardiometabolic health is still lacking. Identifying the effective health promotion program and understanding changes in cardiometabolic health linking these interventions to cognition would have important medical implications. This RCT aimed to examine the effect of single and combined interventions of diet and exercise on cognitive function and cardiometabolic health in postmenopausal women with obesity. Ninety-two postmenopausal women with obesity were randomly assigned to diet group (intermittent fasting 2 days/week, 3 months), exercise group (physical-cognitive exercise 3 days/week, 3 months), combined group, or control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;23/group). All cognitive outcomes and cardiometabolic outcomes were measured at baseline and post-3 months. Primary outcomes were executive functions, memory, and plasma BDNF levels. Secondary outcomes were global cognition, attention, language domain, plasma adiponectin levels, IL-6 levels, metabolic parameters, and physical function. At the end of the 3-month intervention, the exercise and combined group demonstrated significant memory improvement which was accompanied by significant improvements in plasma BDNF level, insulin levels, HOMA-IR, %body fat, and muscle strength when compared to controls (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Only the combined intervention group demonstrated a significant improvement in executive function and increased plasma adiponectin levels when compared to control (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Surprisingly, no cognitive improvement was observed in the diet group (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). Significant reduction in cholesterol levels was shown in the diet and combined groups when compared to controls (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Among the three intervention groups, there were no significant differences in all cognitive outcomes and cardiometabolic outcomes (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). However, all three intervention groups showed significant improvements in plasma BDNF levels, weight, BMI, WHR, fat mass, and predicted VO2 max, when compared to control (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). These findings suggest that combined physical-cognitive exercise and dietary intervention are promising interventions to improve cognition and obesity-related complications of postmenopausal women with obesity.

To identify associations of growth hormone mediators with glycemic failure, beta cell function, and insulin sensitivity in youth-onset T2D. This post hoc secondary analysis of the Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) randomized clinical trial, which enrolled participants from July 2004 to February 2009, included 398 participants from 15 university-affiliated medical centers with available plasma samples from baseline and 36 months. Participants were youths aged 10 to 17 years with a duration of T2D of less than 2 years who were randomized to metformin, metformin plus lifestyle intervention, or metformin plus rosiglitazone. Participants were followed up for a mean (SD) of 3.9 (1.5) years during the trial, ending in 2011. Statistical analysis was performed from August 2022 to November 2023. Plasma insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), growth hormone receptor (GHR), and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1). Main outcomes were (1) loss of glycemic control during the TODAY study, defined as hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of 8% or more for 6 months or inability to wean from insulin therapy, and (2) baseline and 36-month measures of glycemia (fasting glucose, HbA1c), insulin sensitivity (1/fasting C-peptide), high-molecular-weight adiponectin, and beta cell function (C-peptide index, C-peptide oral disposition index). This analysis included 398 participants (mean [SD] age, 13.9 [2.0] years; 248 girls [62%]; 166 Hispanic participants [42%]; 134 non-Hispanic Black participants [34%], and 84 non-Hispanic White participants [21%]). A greater increase in IGF-1 level between baseline and 36 months was associated with lower odds of glycemic failure (odds ratio [OR], 0.995 [95% CI, 0.991-0.997]; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001) and higher C-peptide index per 100-ng/mL increase in IGF-1 (&#x3b2; [SE], 0.015 [0.003]; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). A greater increase in log2 GHR level between baseline and 36 months was associated with higher odds of glycemic failure (OR, 1.75 [95% CI, 1.05-2.99]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.04) and lower C-peptide index (&#x3b2; [SE], -0.02 [0.006]; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). A greater increase in log2 IGFBP-1 level between baseline and 36 months was associated with higher odds of glycemic failure (OR, 1.37 [95% CI, 1.09-1.74]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.007) and higher high-molecular-weight adiponectin (&#x3b2; [SE], 431 [156]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.007). This study suggests that changes in plasma growth hormone mediators are associated with loss of glycemic control in youth-onset T2D, with IGF-1 associated with lower risk and GHR and IGFBP-1 associated with increased risk.

    "abstract": "Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI) is widespread in the treatment of ischemic heart disease, and its treatment options are currently limited. Adiponectin (APN) is an adipocytokine with cardioprotective properties; however, the mechanisms of APN in MIRI are unclear. Therefore, based on preclinical (animal model) evidence, the cardioprotective effects of APN and the underlying mechanisms were explored. The literature was searched for the protective effect of APN on MIRI in six databases until 16 November 2023, and data were extracted according to selection criteria. The outcomes were the size of the myocardial necrosis area and hemodynamics. Markers of oxidation, apoptosis, and inflammation were secondary outcome indicators.

    "abstract": "Whilst glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs) are effective for treating adolescent obesity, weight loss maintenance (WLM; preventing weight regain) remains a challenge. Our goal was to investigate appetite/satiety hormones and eating behaviours that may predict WLM with exenatide (a GLP1-RA) versus placebo in adolescents with severe obesity. Adolescents who had &#x2265;5% body mass index (BMI) reduction with meal replacement therapy were randomized to 52&#x2009;weeks of once-weekly exenatide extended release or placebo. In this secondary analysis, eating behaviours and appetite/satiety regulation hormones post-meal replacement therapy (pre-randomization to exenatide or placebo) were evaluated as possible predictors of WLM. Percent change in BMI from randomization to 52&#x2009;weeks served as the primary measure of WLM. The analysis included 66 adolescents (mean age 16.0&#x2009;years; 47% female). Lower leptin response to meal testing was associated with greater WLM in terms of BMI percent change in those receiving exenatide compared to placebo (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.007) after adjusting for sex, age and BMI. There were no other significant predictors of WLM. Prior to exenatide, lower leptin response to meals was associated with improved WLM with exenatide compared to placebo. The mostly null findings of this study suggest that GLP1-RA treatment may produce similar WLM for adolescents with obesity regardless of age, BMI, sex and eating behaviours.",

    "title": "Adiponectin blood levels and autism spectrum disorders: a systematic review.",
    "abstract": "To review the relationship between adiponectin levels and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in children. ASDs are associated with pervasive social interaction and communication abnormalities. Researchers have studied various pathophysiological mechanisms underlying ASDs to identify predictors for an early diagnosis to optimize treatment outcomes. Immune dysfunction, perhaps mediated by a decrease in anti-inflammatory adipokine, adiponectin, along with changes in other adipokines, may play a central role in increasing the risk for ASDs. However, other factors, such as low maternal vitamin D levels, atherosclerosis, diabetes, obesity, cardio-metabolic diseases, preterm delivery, and oxytocin gene polymorphism may also contribute to increased risk for ASDs. Searches on the database; PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane using keywords; adiponectin, adipokines, ASD, autism, autistic disorder, included English-language studies published till September 2022. Data were extracted on mean differences between adiponectin levels in children with and without ASDs. The search yielded six studies providing data on adiponectin levels in young patients with ASDs. As can be seen from Table&#xa0;1, four of the six studies were positive for an inverse correlation between ASD and adiponectin levels. In addition, two of the four positive and one negative studies found low adiponectin levels associated with and the severity of autistic symptoms. However, results from one reviewed study were insignificant. Most studies reviewed yielded lower adiponectin levels in children with ASDs as well as the severity of autistic symptoms.",

    "title": "Osteo-immunological impact of radon spa treatment: due to radon or spa alone? Results from the prospective, thermal bath placebo-controlled RAD-ON02 trial.",
    "abstract": "Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are associated with pain and lead to reduced mobility and quality of life for patients. Radon therapy is used as alternative or complementary to pharmaceutical treatments. According to previous reports, radon spa leads to analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms are widely unknown. A previous study (RAD-ON01) revealed, that bone erosion markers like collagen fragments (C-terminal telopeptide, CTX) are reduced after radon spa treatment in serum of patients with degenerative MSDs. Within the scope of the prospective, placebo-controlled RAD-ON02 trial presented here, we analyzed the influence of radon and thermal spa treatment on osteoclastogenesis. From patient blood, we isolate monocytes, seeded them on bone slices and differentiated them in the presence of growth factors into mature osteoclasts (mOCs). Subsequent analysis showed a smaller fraction of mOCs after both treatments, which was even smaller after radon spa treatment. A significantly reduced resorbed area on bone slices reflects this result. Only after radon spa treatment, we detected in the serum of patients a significant decrease of receptor activator of NF-&#x3ba;B ligand (RANKL), which indicates reduced differentiation of OCs. However, other markers for bone resorption (CTX) and bone formation (OPG, OCN) were not altered after both treatments. Adipokines, such as visfatin and leptin that play a role in some MSD-types by affecting osteoclastogenesis, were not changed after both treatments. Further, also immune cells have an influence on osteoclastogenesis, by inhibiting and promoting terminal differentiation and activation of OCs, respectively. After radon treatment, the fraction of Treg cells was significantly increased, whereas Th17 cells were not altered. Overall, we observed that both treatments had an influence on osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. Moreover, radon spa treatment affected the Treg cell population as well as the Th17/Treg ratio were affected, pointing toward a contribution of the immune system after radon spa. These data obtained from patients enrolled in the RAD-ON02 trial indicate that radon is not alone responsible for the effects on bone metabolism, even though they are more pronounced after radon compared to thermal spa treatment.",

    "title": "Adipokines and stroke: A systematic review and meta-analysis of disease risk and patient outcomes.",
    "abstract": "Obesity is reported to increase stroke risk, with adipocyte-derived cytokines or adipokines implicated as mediators. However, the relationship between adipokines and stroke is not well clarified. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the association of adipokines with stroke using fully adjusted risk estimates that incorporated body mass index in a meta-analysis. Data from 52 studies (62,428 patients) were pooled in a random-effects meta-analysis. Adiponectin was independently associated with a lower risk of pre-existing stroke (adjusted odds ratio: 0.64 [95% confidence interval: 0.46-0.88], p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01), whereas leptin (1.08 [1.00-1.17], p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04), resistin (1.06 [1.04-1.08], p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01) and visfatin (1.04 [1.01-1.07], p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01) are associated with a higher risk of stroke, but none with incident stroke. Adipokines independently associated with an ischaemic stroke subtype were adiponectin (0.48 [0.30-0.77], p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01), leptin (1.10 [1.01-1.20], p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04), and resistin (1.06 [1.04-1.08], p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). Fatty acid-binding protein-4 (FABP-4) independently predicted 6-month poor functional outcomes in stroke patients (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.09 [1.06-1.12], p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01); whereas both FABP-4 (1.17 [1.03-1.34], p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01) and visfatin (1.24 [1.00-1.55], p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.05) were predictive of 6-month mortality. Adipokines are associated with a greater risk of pre-existing stroke, but not with the relationship with incident stroke. Adipokines, such as FABP-4 and visfatin, may serve as biomarkers of stroke severity and worsening of stroke outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin is an adipokine playing a central role in the regulation of energy homeostasis, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, as well as immunomodulation. The relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and body composition has highlighted the bidirectional crosstalk between AD's pathophysiology and metabolic disorders. This review aimed to report the current state of knowledge about cellular and molecular mechanisms linking adiponectin and AD, in preclinical studies. Then, we reviewed human studies to assess the relationship between adiponectin levels and AD diagnosis. We also examined the risk of incident AD regarding the participants' baseline adiponectin level, as well as the relationship of adiponectin and cognitive decline in patients with AD. We conducted a systematic review, in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses reporting guideline, of studies published over the last decade on MEDLINE and Cochrane databases. Overall, we reviewed 34 original works about adiponectin in AD, including 11 preclinical studies, two both preclinical and human studies and 21 human studies. Preclinical studies brought convincing evidence for the neuroprotective role of adiponectin on several key mechanisms of AD. Human studies showed conflicting results regarding the relationship between AD and adiponectin levels, as well as regarding the cross-sectional association between cognitive function and adiponectin levels. Adiponectin did not appear as a predictor of incident AD, nor as a predictor of cognitive decline in patients with AD. Despite solid preclinical evidence suggesting the protective role of adiponectin in AD, inconsistent results in humans supports the need for further research.",

    "abstract": "Clinical data on the association between leptin levels and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-related liver fibrosis are conflicting. This meta-analysis aimed to compare circulating leptin between NAFLD patients with versus without liver fibrosis or non-NAFLD controls. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library. Fifteen studies were included, reporting data from 964 individuals (422 NAFLD patients with fibrosis, 297 NAFLD patients without fibrosis, 245 no-NAFLD controls). Leptin standardized mean difference (SMD) was higher in NAFLD patients with fibrosis (F1-F4) than in controls (SMD: 2.27; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.81-3.73); however, this association did not remain robust after the exclusion of studies with morbidly obese individuals. No difference was observed in leptin SMD between NAFLD patients with fibrosis and those without fibrosis (F0), and NAFLD patients without fibrosis versus controls. Heterogeneity was high (I<sup>2</sup>: 66-98%) among studies. Meta-regression analysis revealed a positive association of leptin SMD with homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance, when comparing NAFLD patients with fibrosis versus NAFLD patients without fibrosis (beta: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.04-1.03), and a negative association of leptin SMD with age, when comparing NAFLD patients with fibrosis versus controls (beta: -0.29; 95% CI: -0.53 to -0.05). Circulating leptin was higher in NAFLD patients with liver fibrosis than non-NAFLD controls, an association, however, attenuated after the exclusion of a study with morbidly obese individuals.

    "abstract": "Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) is a dangerous condition with a high mortality rate. Many studies have found an association between adipokines and the development of SAP, but the results are controversial. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of the association of inflammatory adipokines with SAP. We screened PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library for articles on adipokines and SAP published before July 20, 2023. The quality of the literature was assessed using QUADAS criteria. Standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to assess the combined effect. Subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis and publication bias tests were also performed on the information obtained. Fifteen eligible studies included 1332 patients with acute pancreatitis (AP). Pooled analysis showed that patients with SAP had significantly higher serum levels of resistin (SMD&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.78, 95% CI:0.37 to 1.19, z&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.75, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.000).

    "abstract": "Dietary sulfur amino acid restriction (SAAR) improves metabolic health in animals. In this study, we investigated the effect of dietary SAAR on body weight, body composition, resting metabolic rate, gene expression profiles in white adipose tissue (WAT), and an extensive blood biomarker profile&#xa0;in humans with overweight or obesity. N&#x2009;=&#x2009;59 participants with overweight or obesity (73% women) were randomized stratified by sex to an 8-week plant-based dietary intervention low (~&#x2009;2&#xa0;g/day, SAAR) or high (~&#x2009;5.6&#xa0;g/day, control group) in sulfur amino acids. The diets were provided in full to the participants, and both investigators and participants were blinded to the intervention. Outcome analyses were performed using linear mixed model regression adjusted for baseline values of the outcome and sex. SAAR led to a&#x2009;~&#x2009;20% greater weight loss compared to controls (&#x3b2; 95% CI -&#xa0;1.14 (-&#xa0;2.04, -&#xa0;0.25) kg, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.013). Despite greater weight loss, resting metabolic rate remained similar between groups. Furthermore, SAAR decreased serum leptin, and increased ketone bodies compared to controls. In WAT, 20 genes were upregulated whereas 24 genes were downregulated (FDR&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;5%) in the SAAR group compared to controls. Generally applicable gene set enrichment analyses revealed that processes associated with ribosomes were upregulated, whereas processes related to structural components were downregulated. Our study shows that SAAR leads to greater weight loss, decreased leptin and increased ketone bodies compared to controls. Further research on SAAR is needed to investigate the therapeutic potential for metabolic conditions in humans.

    "abstract": "Considering the role of adipokine on diseases related to metabolic syndrome and even chronic diseases, it seems necessary to investigate effective interventions on these factors. This study aimed to comprehensively investigate the effects of metformin on adipokines. A comprehensive search was conducted in five databases using established keywords. The purpose of this search was to uncover controlled studies that have examined the impact of metformin on adipokines, specifically leptin, adiponectin, and resistin. The random-effects model analysis was used to provide pooled weighted mean difference and 95% confidence intervals. Forty-nine studies were included in this article. The pooled findings showed that that the administration of metformin significantly decreases leptin (WMD: -3.06&#xa0;ng/ml, 95&#xa0;% CI: -3.81, -2.30, P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) and resistin (WMD: -1.27&#xa0;&#xb5;g/mL, 95&#xa0;% CI: -2.22, -0.31, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.009) levels in different populations compared to the control group. However, no significant effect of this antidiabetic drug on adiponectin levels was reported.

Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials,&#xa0;were searched for studies from 1946 to October 2022, using predefined syntax. Outcome data for the meta-analysis were extracted on odds ratios (OR) of CRS prevalence based on the presence of overweight/obesity and mean serum leptin levels. A Meta-analysis was performed using the DerSimonian-Laird estimator to pool extracted data by the generalized inverse variance approach. Random effect models were utilized due to the small sample size. A qualitative synthesis was performed on articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria for the Meta-analysis. Thirty-six studies met the systematic review inclusion criteria out of 1113 articles screened. A total of 6 studies were included in the pooled Meta-analysis of the various outcome variables. Our pooled meta-analysis observed a positive association between overweight/obesity and the prevalence of CRS (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.33, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17-1.51). The pooled ratio of the means analysis of the mean serum leptin levels between CRS with nasal polyposis and control patients was 2.21 (95% CI: 1.45; 3.36). Our pooled Meta-analysis indicates a positive association between overweight/obesity and CRS. Future prospective studies are needed to explore the association between CRS and obesity with an understanding of potential confounding comorbidities, including studies focused on assessing the underlying immunologic mechanism of this association.",

    "abstract": "Research indicates that green tea extract (GTE) supplementation is beneficial for a range of conditions, including several forms of cancer, CVD and liver diseases; nevertheless, the existing evidence addressing its effects on body composition, oxidative stress and obesity-related hormones is inconclusive. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effects of GTE supplementation on body composition (body mass (BM), body fat percentage (BFP), fat mass (FM), BMI, waist circumference (WC)), obesity-related hormones (leptin, adiponectin and ghrelin) and oxidative stress (malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC)) markers. We searched proper databases, including PubMed/Medline, Scopus and Web of Science, up to July 2022 to recognise published randomised controlled trials (RCT) that investigated the effects of GTE supplementation on the markers mentioned above. A random effects model was used to carry out a meta-analysis. The heterogeneity among the studies was assessed using the I<sup>2</sup> index. Among the initial 11&#xa0;286 studies identified from an electronic database search, fifty-nine studies involving 3802 participants were eligible to be included in this meta-analysis. Pooled effect sizes indicated that BM, BFP, BMI and MDA significantly reduced following GTE supplementation. In addition, GTE supplementation increased adiponectin and TAC, with no effects on FM, leptin and ghrelin. Certainty of evidence across outcomes ranged from low to high. Our results suggest that GTE supplementation can attenuate oxidative stress, BM, BMI and BFP, which are thought to negatively affect human health. Moreover, GTE as a nutraceutical dietary supplement can increase TAC and adiponectin.",

    "abstract": "Deficiency in the adipose-derived hormone leptin or leptin receptor signaling causes class 3 obesity in individuals with genetic loss-of-function mutations in leptin or its receptor LEPR and metabolic and liver disease in individuals with hypoleptinemia secondary to lipoatrophy such as in individuals with generalized lipodystrophy. Therapies that restore leptin-LEPR signaling may resolve these metabolic sequelae. We developed a fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb), REGN4461 (mibavademab), that activates the human LEPR in the absence or presence of leptin. In obese leptin knockout mice, REGN4461 normalized body weight, food intake, blood glucose, and insulin sensitivity. In a mouse model of generalized lipodystrophy, REGN4461 alleviated hyperphagia, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hepatic steatosis. In a phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled two-part study, REGN4461 was well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile. Treatment of individuals with overweight or obesity with REGN4461 decreased body weight over 12 weeks in those with low circulating leptin concentrations (&lt;8 ng/ml) but had no effect on body weight in individuals with higher baseline leptin. Furthermore, compassionate-use treatment of a single patient with atypical partial lipodystrophy and a history of undetectable leptin concentrations associated with neutralizing antibodies to metreleptin was associated with noteable improvements in circulating triglycerides and hepatic steatosis. Collectively, these translational data unveil an agonist LEPR mAb that may provide clinical benefit in disorders associated with relatively low leptin concentrations.",

    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Diabetes can cause various vascular complications. The Compounded Danshen-Dripping-Pill (CDDP) is widely used in China. This study aimed to analyze the effectiveness and safety of CDDP in the blood viscosity (BV) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Materials and Methods: We conducted a systematic search of seven databases from their inception to July 2022 for randomized controlled trials that used CDDP to treat T2DM. To evaluate BV, we measured low shear rate (LSR), high shear rate (HSR), and plasma viscosity (PV). Homocysteine and adiponectin levels were also assessed as factors that could affect BV. Results: We included 18 studies and 1532 patients with T2DM. Meta-analysis revealed that CDDP significantly reduced LSR (mean difference [MD] -2.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] -3.77 to -1.72), HSR (MD -0.86, 95% CI -1.08 to -0.63), and PV (MD -0.37, 95% CI -0.54 to -0.19) compared to controls. CDDP also reduced homocysteine (MD -8.32, 95% CI -9.05 to -7.58), and increased plasma adiponectin (MD 2.72, 95% CI 2.13 to 3.32). Adverse events were reported less frequently in the treatment groups than in controls. Conclusions: CDDP is effective in reducing BV on T2DM. However, due to the poor design and quality of the included studies, high-quality, well-designed studies are required in the future.",

    "title": "The cross-talk between leptin and circadian rhythm signaling proteins in physiological processes: a systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Today, modern lifestyles and disrupted sleep patterns cause circadian clock rhythm impairments that are associated with altered leptin levels, which subsequently affect a wide range of physiological processes and have significant health burdens on societies. Nevertheless, there has been no systematic review of circadian clock genes and proteins, leptin, and related signaling pathways. Accordingly, we systematically reviewed circadian clock proteins, leptin, and molecular mechanisms between them by searching Pubmed, Scopus, ProQuest, Web of Sciences, and Google Scholar until September 2022. After considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 20 animal studies were selected. The risk of bias was assessed in each study. The results clarified the reciprocal interconnected relationship between circadian clock genes and leptin. Circadian clock genes regulate leptin expression and signaling via different mechanisms, such as CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimers, which increase the expression of PPARs. PPARs induce the expression of C/EBP&#x3b1;, a key factor in upregulating leptin expression. CLOCK-BMAL1 also induces the expression of Per1 and Rev-erb genes. PER1 activates mTORC1 and mTORC1 enhances the expression of C/EBP&#x3b1;. In addition, REV-ERBs activate the leptin signaling pathway. Also, leptin controls the expression of circadian clock genes by triggering the AMPK and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways, which regulate the activity of PPARs. Moreover, the roles of these molecular mechanisms are elucidated in different physiological processes and organs. Crosstalk between circadian clock genes and leptin and their affecting elements should be considered in the selection of new therapeutic targets for related disorders, especially obesity and metabolic impairments.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin replacement therapy holds the potential to benefit numerous human diseases, and ongoing research applies particular interest in how adiponectin acts against Metabolic-associated Fatty Liver Disease (MAFLD) and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH). However, the pharmacological limitations of the intact protein have prompted a focus on alternative options, specifically peptidic and small molecule agonists targeting the adiponectin receptor. AdipoRon is an extensively researched non-peptidic drug candidate in adiponectin replacement therapy. In turn, ADP355 is an adiponectin-based active short peptide. They have garnered significant attention due to their potential as substitutes for adiponectin. Researchers have studied AdipoRon's and ADP355's efficacy and therapeutic applications in various disease conditions. However, the effects of AdipoRon and ADP355 against NAFLD and NASH models advanced more, and no systematic review explored this area before. This systematic review was conceived to address the deficiency mentioned above and consider the lack of clinical evidence. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were utilized. To assess the risk of bias in systematic review, The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist was employed. Results from pre-clinical evidence show that AdipoRon and ADP355 represent promising effects in NAFLD and NASH-related models, including reducing hepatic steatosis, modulating inflammation, improving insulin sensitivity, enhancing mitochondrial function, and protecting against liver fibrosis. While AdipoRon and ADP355 exhibit promise in pre-clinical studies and experimental models, additional clinical trials are necessary to assess their effectiveness, safety, and potential translational therapeutic potential uses in NAFLD and NASH human cases.",

    "abstract": "The potential benefits of adiponectin replacement therapy extend to numerous human diseases, with current research showing particular interest in its effectiveness against specific cancer forms, especially hormone-related. However, limitations in the pharmacological use of the intact protein have led to a focus on alternative options. AdipoRon is an extensively studied non-peptidic drug candidate for adiponectin replacement therapy. While researchers have explored the efficacy and therapeutic applications of AdipoRon in various disease conditions, their effects against cancer models advanced more, with no review regarding AdipoRon's efficacy against hormone-related cancers being published. The present systematic review aims to fill this gap. Preclinical evidence was compiled from PubMed, EMBASE, COCHRANE, and Google Scholar following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, and the manuscript's quality assessment was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Checklist Critical Appraisal Tool for Systematic Reviews' Quality. The included nine studies incorporated various cell and animal models of the pancreas, gynaecological system, and osteosarcoma cancers. AdipoRon demonstrated effectiveness against pancreatic cancer by activating p44/42 MAPK, mitochondrial dysfunction, and AMPK-mediated inhibition of ACC1. In gynaecological cancers, it exhibited promising anticancer effects through the activation of AMPK, potential inhibition of mTOR, and modulation of the SET1B/BOD1/AdipoR1 signaling cascade. Against osteosarcoma, AdipoRon worked by perturbing ERK1/2 signaling and reducing p70S6K phosphorylation. AdipoRon shows promise in preclinical studies, but human trials are crucial for clinical safety and effectiveness. Caution is needed due to potential off-target effects, especially in cancer therapy with multi-target approaches. Structural biology and computational methods can help predict these effects.",

    "abstract": "Preeclampsia (PE) is a new-onset pregnancy-specific disorder with a high prevalence that leads to over 70 000 maternal and 500 000 foetal fatalities worldwide each year. The level of chemerin, a newly identified adipokine, is increased in diabetic and obese patients. Currently, there are several studies describing the relationship between maternal circulating chemerin levels and PE. Therefore, this study aimed to assess their association in pooled samples. Four databases were systematically searched to identify potential studies that reported circulating chemerin levels in PE and normal pregnancy groups. Standardized mean differences (SMDs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and 95% prediction intervals (PIs) were calculated using a random-effects meta-analysis. The probability of heterogeneity was also investigated by sensitivity analysis, subgroup analysis, and meta-regression. Thirteen studies in 11 articles with a total of 860 PE patients and 1309 women with normal pregnancies met the inclusion criteria. The results of the meta-analysis revealed that circulating chemerin, which levels in PE patients were considerably higher than those in controls (SMD&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.39, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.77, 95% PI: -0.07, 2.86). Moreover, sensitivity analysis determined that the outcomes of the overall pooled results were not affected after the elimination of any study. Notably, subgroup analysis demonstrated a similar expression pattern irrespective of geographic location, severity, timing of sampling, and sample size. Last, there were no factors that significantly impacted the overall estimate, according to meta-regression. This meta-analysis is the first to assess circulating chemerin levels in PE patients. The findings indicate that circulating chemerin levels may be a potential marker to diagnose PE.",

    "abstract": "Previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for adiponectin, a complex trait linked to type 2 diabetes and obesity, identified &gt;20 associated loci. However, most loci were identified in populations of European ancestry, and many of the target genes underlying the associations remain unknown. We conducted a cross-ancestry adiponectin GWAS meta-analysis in &#x2264;46,434 individuals from the Metabolic Syndrome in Men (METSIM) cohort and the ADIPOGen and AGEN consortiums. We combined study-specific association summary statistics using a fixed-effects, inverse variance-weighted approach. We identified 22 loci associated with adiponectin (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;5&#xd7;10<sup>-8</sup>), including 15 known and seven previously unreported loci. Among individuals of European ancestry, Genome-wide Complex Traits Analysis joint conditional analysis (GCTA-COJO) identified 14 additional distinct signals at the ADIPOQ, CDH13, HCAR1, and ZNF664 loci. Leveraging the cross-ancestry data, FINEMAP&#xa0;+ SuSiE identified 45 causal variants (PP&#xa0;&gt;&#xa0;0.9), which also exhibited potential pleiotropy for cardiometabolic traits. To prioritize target genes at associated loci, we propose a combinatorial likelihood scoring formalism (Gene Priority Score [GPScore]) based on measures derived from 11 gene prioritization strategies and the physical distance to the transcription start site. With GPScore, we prioritize the 30 most probable target genes underlying the adiponectin-associated variants in the cross-ancestry analysis, including well-known causal genes (e.g., ADIPOQ, CDH13) and additional genes (e.g., CSF1, RGS17). Functional association networks revealed complex interactions of prioritized genes, their functionally connected genes, and their underlying pathways centered around insulin and adiponectin signaling, indicating an essential role in regulating energy balance in the body, inflammation, coagulation, fibrinolysis, insulin resistance, and diabetes. Overall, our analyses identify and characterize adiponectin association signals and inform experimental interrogation of target genes for adiponectin.",

Exercise may reduce the risk of disease by attenuating low-grade chronic inflammation. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effects of exercise on inflammatory markers in postmenopausal women struggling with overweight and obesity. Literature as of May 2023 was searched from databases such as Cochrane, Embase, Pubmed, Web of Science, and EBSCO and English-language randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that meet the inclusion criteria were selected. Studies were included based on the following criteria: (A) Written in English; (B) RCTs; (C) Postmenopausal women impacted by overweight and obesity as research objects; (D) Outcome measurements include CRP, TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-6, and adiponectin; (E) Duration of the exercise intervention is eight weeks.

    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects approximately 30% of adults worldwide, with chronic low-grade inflammation being a key pathophysiological feature of progression. The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is recognized for improving metabolic and hepatic outcomes in people with diabetes and NAFLD, in part, via anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of an ad libitum MedDiet versus low-fat diet (LFD) on inflammatory markers in adults with NAFLD. It was hypothesized that the MedDiet, and its individual components, would improve inflammation. This multicenter, randomized controlled trial, randomized participants to a MedDiet or LFD intervention for 12 weeks. Primary outcomes included change from baseline to 12 weeks for serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1;, adiponectin, leptin, and resistin. Forty-two participants (60% female; age 52.3 &#xb1; 12.6 years; body mass index, 32.2 &#xb1; 6.2 kg/m&#xb2;) were randomized to the MedDiet (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;19) or low-fat diet (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;23). At 12 weeks, the LFD showed a greater decrease in leptin compared with the MedDiet (-1.20 &#xb1; 3.9 ng/mL vs 0.64 &#xb1; 3.5 ng/mL, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.010). Adiponectin significantly improved within the MedDiet (13.7 &#xb1; 9.2 &#xb5;g/mL to 17.0 &#xb1; 12.5 &#xb5;g/mL, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.016), but not within the LFD group. No statistically significant changes were observed for other inflammatory markers following the MedDiet or LFD. Adherence to the MedDiet significantly improved in both study arms, although greater improvements were seen in the MedDiet group. Adiponectin significantly improved following a Mediterranean diet intervention, in the absence of weight loss. The low-fat diet did not elicit improvements in inflammatory markers. High-quality clinical trials appropriately powered to inflammatory markers are required in this population.",

We included seventeen references in the systematic analysis, and sixteen in the meta-analysis. Baseline results of pro-inflammatory biomarkers, including serum interleukin (IL)-6, serum and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, serum C-reactive protein (CRP)/hs-CRP, and serum and GCF resistin, were higher in obesity subjects than in normal weight subjects. The effect of NSPT with respect to levels of cytokines/adipocytokines, including IL-6, TNF-a, CRP/hs-CRP, resistin, adiponectin, leptin and retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4), were then analyzed in the systematic and meta-analysis. After three months of NSPT, serum (MD&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.54, CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.62 - -0.46), and GCF (MD&#x2009;=&#x2009;-2.70, CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;-4.77 - -0.63) levels of IL-6, along with the serum RBP4 (MD&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.39, CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.68-0.10) decreased in periodontitis individuals with obesity. NSPT also improved GCF adiponectin levels after three months (MD&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.37, CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.29 - 4.45) in periodontitis individuals without obesity. Obese status altered the baseline levels of cytokines/adipocytokines (serum IL-6, serum and GCF TNF-a, serum CRP/hs-CRP, and serum and GCF resistin). Then NSPT can shift the levels of specific pro-inflammatory mediators and anti-inflammatory mediators in biological fluids, both in obesity and non-obesity individuals. NSPT can reduce serum and GCF IL-6 levels together with serum RBP4 level in individuals with obesity after 3&#xa0;months, besides, there is no sufficient evidence to prove that obese patients have a statistically significant decrease in the levels of other cytokines compared to patients with normal weight. NSPT can also increase GCF adiponectin level in normal weight individuals after 3&#xa0;months. Our findings imply the potential ideal follow-up intervals and sensitive biomarkers for clinical bioanalysis in personalized decision-making of effect of NSPT due to patients' BMI value.",

    "abstract": "The present systematic review and meta-analysis sought to evaluate the effects of&#xa0;conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) supplementation on glycemic control, adipokines, cytokines, malondialdehyde (MDA) and liver function enzymes in patients at risk of cardiovascular disease. Relevant studies were obtained by searching the PubMed, SCOPUS and Web of Science databases (from inception to January 2023). Weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis, and publication bias were reported using standard methods. A pooled analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) revealed that CLA supplementation led to a significant increment in fasting blood glucose (FBG) (WMD: 4.49 mg/dL; 95%CI: 2.39 to 6.59; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (WMD: 2.54 IU/L; 95%CI: 0.06 to 5.01; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.044). Moreover, CLA supplementation decreased leptin (WMD: -1.69 ng/ml; 95% CI: -1.80 to -1.58; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) (WMD: -0.44 pg/ml; 95%CI: -0.86 to -0.02; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.037). However, there was no effect on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x3b1;), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) adiponectin compared to the control group. Our findings showed the overall favorable effect of CLA supplementation on the adipokines and cytokines including serum IL-6, and leptin, while increasing FBG and AST. It should be noted that the mentioned metabolic effects of CLA consumption were small and may not reach clinical importance. CRD42023426374.",

    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver condition worldwide. NAFLD is often associated with features of Metabolic Syndrome such as obesity and insulin resistance. The current comprehensive meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the association between circulating Omentin levels and NAFLD. A systematic search in Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases was conducted to identify relevant studies up until 5th May 2022. The standard mean difference (SMD) values and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed for the association of Omentin levels with NAFLD risk in a random effect model. The meta-analysis involved 6 case-control studies with a total of 371 cases and 269 controls. Pooled SMD showed no significant difference in serum Omentin between NAFLD and healthy groups (SMD= -0.047 and 95% CI -0.957_0.862 P=0.91). Subgroup analysis based on sample size showed that the average Omentin levels were significantly higher in NAFLD patients in studies with sample size &#x2265;70 (SMD=0.356 CI 0.056_0.655 P=0.02). Additional well-designed studies with more sample sizes are essential to clarify the potential role of Omentin as a risk marker of NAFLD.",

    "title": "Unveiling the Ghrelin and Obestatin Roles in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Assessing Their Pathogenic Implications and Biomarker Utility.",
    "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), pathologically known as chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, is among the diseases with a high burden worldwide. Ghrelin and obestatin, as adipocytokines mainly in adipose tissues, are involved in immune responses and inflammatory pathways. Studies have assessed the circulatory ghrelin levels in patients with IBD. Herein, we aim to pool these studies through systematic review and meta-analysis. Four international databases, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Web of Science were systematically searched for studies assessing ghrelin or obestatin levels in patients with IBD (either Crohn's disease [CD] or ulcerative colitis [UC]) in active phase or in remission. Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted in order to calculate the pooled estimate using the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Nineteen studies were included in our systematic review, comprising 1064 patients with IBD (476 UC and 588 CD). A meta-analysis of 11 studies for comparison of active and quiescent disease showed that patients with active IBD had significantly higher levels of ghrelin (SMD, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.06 to 1.34; P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.03). However, in separate analyses for UC or CD, no such difference was observed (SMD, 1.30; 95% CI, -0.28 to 2.88, P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.11; and SMD, 0.80; 95% CI, -0.41 to 2.01; P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.20, respectively). No significant difference was also observed in ghrelin levels between patients with active IBD and healthy control subjects. Obestatin levels also were not different between patients with active disease and those in remission (SMD, 0.31; 95% CI, -0.05 to 0.68; P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.09). On the other hand, the obestatin/ghrelin ratio was significantly lower in patients with active IBD (SMD, -1.90; 95% CI, -2.45 to -1.35; P&#x2005;&lt;&#x2005;.01). Our results demonstrate that IBD patients with active disease have higher levels of ghrelin, which needs to be confirmed in future studies. Also, the obestatin/ghrelin ratio might be a promising biomarker for the assessment of disease activity. Ghrelin, as an adipokine, can be a potential biomarker for distinguishing active inflammatory bowel disease from disease remission. Obestatin/ghrelin ratio was also significantly lower in patients with active inflammatory bowel disease. These biomarkers should be investigated in future studies.",

    "abstract": "Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a frequent chronic complication of deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Biomarkers are potentially valuable clinical tools for handling PTS. The purpose of this review was to examine which biomarkers are associated with the development of PTS in adults with lower extremity DVT. We performed a systematic review of all English language prospective studies of biomarkers and PTS published in PubMed and EMBASE. Studies were included if diagnosing DVT by diagnostic imaging and assessing PTS by clinical scales, for example, the Villalta scale. Biomarkers of thrombophilia and pathological clot properties were not assessed. Data was reported qualitatively. 15 prospective studies were included. Studies varied widely in study design and methods of data analysis. Forty-six different biomarkers were examined, with seven being measured in two or more studies. The most frequently studied biomarkers were D-dimer, CRP, and IL-6. Associations between PTS and D-dimer were predominantly significant, while results on CRP and IL-6 were inconsistent. ICAM-1 was consistently associated with PTS in all studies and at all timepoints. IL-10 was significantly related to PTS development in the largest study and at all time points. Adiponectin, tPA, HRG and TAFI, MMP-1 and -8, and TIMP-1 and -2 were significantly associated with PTS in single studies. (1) Further research on biomarkers and PTS is clearly warranted. (2) Significant differences in study designs made it difficult to draw reliable conclusions regarding individual biomarkers. We suggest the implementation of a standardized framework for the study of biomarkers and PTS, to make comparison of future studies more feasible. (3) D-dimer, ICAM-1, IL-10, MMP-1 and 8, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, and adiponectin are clinical biomarkers of particular interest to include in future studies of PTS. Large scale systemic quantitative proteomic analyses of DVT patients could help identify novel biomarkers of interest in PTS-patients.",

    "title": "Relationship between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and adiponectin concentrations: An updated meta-analysis and single-cell RNA sequencing.",
    "abstract": "Adipose tissue, being an organ of the endocrine system, can influence the severity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Even though several inflammatory markers can potentially significantly influence lung function, the precise function of adipokines, like adiponectin, in COPD is still disputed. To analyze the association of COPD with adiponectin concentrations, a meta-analysis of the most recent literature and single-cell sequencing data were conducted. Studies in Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were browsed to obtain relevant data, which were then assessed with the aid of R 4.1.3 and STATA 11.0 software. Standardized mean differences and correlation coefficients aided the analysis of effect values. Moreover, a single-cell sequencing GSE136831 dataset was retrieved to ascertain the mRNA expression of adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) in the lung tissue of COPD patients to confirm the difference in the expression of adiponectin between the case and control groups. This meta-analysis comprised 18 publications involving 24 studies. The overall combined data established the concentration of plasma/serum adiponectin as significantly higher in patients with COPD compared to healthy subjects. Subgroup analyses based on disease status, specimen type, ethnicity, study design method, measurement method, and age of COPD patients demonstrated that all patients with COPD had elevated levels of adiponectin compared to healthy controls. When subgroup analysis was performed for gender alone, the results depicted that male COPD patients had significantly higher adiponectin than healthy males, while female patients of COPD had elevated adiponectin compared to healthy females. Furthermore, it was found that plasma/serum adiponectin appeared to be positively correlated with tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1;, and it was negatively correlated with FEV1% and FEV1/FVC. The results of single-cell sequencing data suggested that ADIPOQ mRNA was mainly expressed in alveolar epithelial cells, and the level of ADIPOQ mRNA was higher in lung tissues of patients with COPD than in lung tissues of healthy subjects. This meta-analysis suggests that the levels of plasma/serum adiponectin are significantly elevated in patients with COPD versus controls. Tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1;, FEV1/FVC, and FEV1% may all be associated with the concentrations of adiponectin.",

    "abstract": "Resistin, a novel pro-inflammatory protein implicated in inflammatory processes, has been suggested to play a role in colorectal development. However, evidence from observational studies has been inconsistent. Mendelian randomization may be a complementary method to examine this association. We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization to estimate the association between genetically determined circulating resistin concentrations and risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) from the SCALLOP consortium were used as instrumental variables (IVs) for resistin. CRC genetic summary data was obtained from GECCO/CORECT/CCFR (the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium, Colorectal Cancer Transdisciplinary Study, and Colon Cancer Family Registry), and FinnGen (Finland Biobank). The inverse variance weighted method (IVW) was applied in the main analysis, and other robust methods were used as sensitivity analyses. Estimates for the association from the two data sources were then pooled using a meta-analysis approach. Thirteen pQTLs were identified as IVs explaining together 7.80% of interindividual variation in circulating resistin concentrations. Based on MR analyses, genetically determined circulating resistin concentrations were not associated with incident CRC (pooled-IVW-OR per standard deviation of resistin, 1.01; 95% CI 0.96, 1.06; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.67. Restricting the analyses to using IVs within or proximal to the resistin-encoding gene (cis-IVs), or to IVs located elsewhere in the genome (trans-IVs) provided similar results. The association was not altered when stratified by sex or CRC subsites. We found no evidence of a relationship between genetically determined circulating resistin concentrations and risk of CRC.",

Were enrolled females with severe obesity undergoing RYGP with MetS (n = 11) and without (n = 39). Anthropometric data and circulating levels of glucose, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), non-HDL total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), adiponectin, and leptin were assessed before and 6 months after RYGB. Significant reductions in weight, body mass index, and glucose, total cholesterol, LDL, and leptin were observed after surgery, with higher levels of HDL, adiponectin, and adiponectin/leptin ratio being observed after surgery compared to the preoperative values of those. This study demonstrated that weight loss induced by RYGB in patients with severe obesity with or without MetS improved biochemical and systemic inflammatory parameters, particularly the adiponectin/leptin ratio.",

    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients on hemodialysis may have a modified appetite due to several factors including a lack of uremic toxins elimination. The use of medium cutoff (MCO) dialysis membranes has been suggested as an alternative to improve the removal of toxins, especially those of medium and high molecular weight. This study aimed to compare the effect of hemodialysis using MCO and high-flux membranes on the appetite and leptin levels of CKD patients. This is a predefined exploratory analysis of a randomized, open study, with a crossover design of 28&#xa0;weeks of follow-up, which compared the effects of MCO and high-flux membranes in 32 CKD patients on hemodialysis. Appetite assessments were performed using the Appetite and Food Satisfaction Questionnaire. The MCO group had an appetite score of 3.00 (1.00-5.50) and 3.00 (1.00-5.00) at the beginning and at the end of the treatment period, respectively, while the high-flux group had 1.00 (0.25-6.00) and 2.00 (0.75-3.25). There were no effects of treatment (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.573), time (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.376), and interaction (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.770) between the MCO and high-flux groups.

    "abstract": "This trial assessed the effects of a calorie-restricted diet (CRD) with hydroxycitric acid (HCA) supplementation on appetite-regulating hormones, obesity indices, body composition, and appetite in women with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This study was carried out on 44 overweight/obese women with NAFLD. The patients were randomly assigned into two groups, namely, Intervention group (receiving individual CRD plus HCA tablets per day) and Control group (receiving only CRD) for eight weeks. Obesity indices, body composition, appetite status, and serum levels of leptin and adiponectin were assessed before and after the intervention. Forty patients completed the trial. At the end of the trial, although significant reductions were found in most of the studied obesity indices in the intervention group, there was only a significant decrease in waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio in the control group. Fat mass and muscle mass significantly decreased in the intervention group (p=0.044 and p=0.024, respectively), and the reduction in visceral fat in the intervention group was significantly greater than that in the control group (-0.49&#x2009;kg vs -0.37&#x2009;kg, p=0.024). Intra- and intergroup differences in serum leptin and adiponectin levels and their ratios before and after the trial were not significant. We found a negative and marginally significant correlation between percent of changes in serum adiponectin level and percent of changes in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.429, p=0.067) and BMI (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.440, p=0.059) as well as an inverse relationship between percent of changes in leptin/adiponectin with VAT (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.724, p &lt; 0.001) in the intervention group.

As no single biomarker reflects the full ageing process, we aimed to investigate five CVD- and age-related markers and the effects of selenium and coenzyme Q10 intervention to elucidate the mechanisms that may influence the course of ageing. Methods: This is a sub-study of a previous prospective double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial that included 441 subjects low in selenium (mean age 77, 49% women). The active treatment group (n = 220) received 200 &#xb5;g/day of selenium and 200 mg/day of coenzyme Q10, combined. Blood samples were collected at inclusion and after 48 months for measurements of the intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1), adiponectin, leptin, stem cell factor (SCF) and osteoprotegerin (OPG), using ELISAs. Repeated measures of variance and ANCOVA evaluations were used to compare the two groups. In order to better understand and reduce the complexity of the relationship between the biomarkers and age, factor analyses and structural equation modelling (SEM) were performed, and a structural model is presented. Results: Correlation analyses of biomarker values at inclusion in relation to age, and relevant markers related to inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and fibrosis, demonstrated the biomarkers' association with these pathological processes; however, only ICAM1 and adiponectin were directly correlated with age. SEM analyses showed, however, that the biomarkers ICAM-1, adiponectin, SCF and OPG, but not leptin, all had significant associations with age and formed two independent structural factors, both significantly related to age. While no difference was observed at inclusion, the biomarkers were differently changed in the active treatment and placebo groups (decreasing and increasing levels, respectively) at 48 months (p &#x2264; 0.02 in all, adjusted), and in the SEM model, they showed an anti-ageing impact. Conclusions: Supplementation with selenium/Q10 influenced the analysed biomarkers in ways indicating an anti-ageing effect, and by applying SEM methodology, the interrelationships between two independent structural factors and age were validated.",

    "title": "Dietary Supplements Containing Oat Beta-Glucan and/or Green Coffee (Poly)phenols Showed Limited Effect in Modulating Cardiometabolic Risk Biomarkers in Overweight/Obese Patients without a Lifestyle Intervention.",
    "abstract": "Obesity has reached pandemic proportions and has become a major health concern worldwide. Therefore, it is necessary to find new strategies against this condition and its associated comorbidities. Green coffee polyphenols (GCP) and oat beta-glucans (BGs) have proven their hypolipidaemic and hypoglycaemic effects. This study aimed to examine the effects of the long-term consumption of supplements containing GCP, BG or the novel GCP/BG combination on lipid and glucose metabolism biomarkers in overweight/obese subjects who maintained their dietary habits and physical activity, hence addressing the difficulty that this population faces in adapting to lifestyle changes. A randomised, crossover, blind trial was carried out in 29 volunteers who consumed either GCP (300 mg), BG (2.5 g) or GCP/BG (300 mg + 2.5 g) twice a day for 8 weeks. Blood samples were collected, and blood pressure and body composition were measured at the beginning and end of each intervention. Total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL-C) cholesterol, glycated haemoglobin, fasting glucose, insulin, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase and different hormones and adipokines were analysed. Only VLDL-C (p = 0.01) and diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.027) decreased after the intervention, especially with the BG supplement. There were no other significant changes in the analysed biomarkers. In conclusion, the regular intake of GCP, BG and GCP/BG without lifestyle changes is not an efficient strategy to improve lipid and glucose homeostasis in overweight/obese subjects.",

    "title": "Late, but Not Early, Night Sleep Loss Compromises Neuroendocrine Appetite Regulation and the Desire for Food.",
    "abstract": "There is evidence that reduced sleep duration increases hunger, appetite, and food intake, leading to metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. However, the impact of sleep timing, irrespective of its duration and on the regulation of hunger and appetite, is less clear. We aimed to evaluate the impact of sleep loss during the late vs. early part of the night on the regulation of hunger, appetite, and desire for food. Fifteen normal-weight ([mean &#xb1; SEM] body-mass index: 23.3 &#xb1; 0.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) healthy men were studied in a randomized, balanced, crossover design, including two conditions of sleep loss, i.e., 4 h sleep during the first night-half ('late-night sleep loss'), 4 h sleep during the second night-half ('early-night sleep loss'), and a control condition with 8h sleep ('regular sleep'), respectively. Feelings of hunger and appetite were assessed through visual analogue scales, and plasma ghrelin and leptin were measured from blood samples taken before, during, and after night-time sleep. Ghrelin and feelings of hunger and appetite, as well as the desire for food, were increased after 'late-night sleep loss', but not 'early-night sleep loss', whereas leptin remained unaffected by the timing of sleep loss. Our data indicate that timing of sleep restriction modulates the effects of acute sleep loss on ghrelin and appetite regulation in healthy men. 'Late-night sleep loss' might be a risk factor for metabolic diseases, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Thereby, our findings highlight the metabolic relevance of chronobiological sleep timing.",

    "title": "Comparison of the effects of high-intensity interval and moderate-intensity continuous training on inflammatory markers, cardiorespiratory fitness, and quality of life in breast cancer patients.",
    "abstract": "As the effectiveness of breast cancer treatment has improved, a growing number of long-term breast cancer survivors are seeking help for unique health problems. These patients may be at increased risk of cardiovascular disease due to the side effects of treatment. The positive impact of most types of exercise has been repeatedly reported in people with cancer, but the most effective exercise approaches for maximum beneficial adaptations remain controversial. Thus, this study aimed to compare the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) on inflammatory indices, adipokines, metabolic markers, body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, and quality of life in breast cancer patients during adjuvant endocrine therapy. Thirty non-metastatic breast cancer patients during adjuvant endocrine therapy who had been treated with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy were recruited from Iran and randomized to HIIT, MICT, or control groups for a supervised exercise intervention that took place 3 times a week for 12 weeks. The training intensity was determined based on the peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), and the volume of training was matched in HIIT and MICT based on the VO2peak. Body composition, functional capacity, cardiorespiratory fitness, metabolic indices, sex hormones, adipokines, and inflammatory markers were assessed before and after the intervention. The VO2peak increased by 16.8% in the HIIT group in comparison to baseline values (mean difference&#x202f;=&#x202f;3.61 mL/kg/min). HIIT significantly improved the VO2peak compared to control (mean difference&#x202f;=&#x202f;3.609 mL/kg/min) and MICT (mean differences&#x202f;=&#x202f;2.974 mL/kg/min) groups. Both HIIT (mean difference&#x202f;=&#x202f;9.172 mg/dL) and MICT (mean difference&#x202f;=&#x202f;7.879 mg/dL) interventions significantly increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels compared to the control group. The analysis of covariance showed that physical well-being significantly improved in MICT compared to control group (mean difference&#x202f;=&#x202f;3.268). HIIT significantly improved the social well-being compared to the control group (mean difference&#x202f;=&#x202f;4.412). Emotional well-being subscale was significantly improved in both MICT (mean difference&#x202f;=&#x202f;4.248) and HIIT (mean difference&#x202f;=&#x202f;4.412) compared to the control group. Functional well-being scores significantly increased in HIIT group compared with control group (mean difference&#x202f;=&#x202f;3.35) . Significant increase were also observed in total functional assessment of cancer therapy-General scores in both HIIT (mean difference&#x202f;=&#x202f;14.204) and MICT groups (mean difference&#x202f;=&#x202f;10.036) compared with control group. The serum level of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 increased significantly (mean difference&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.09 pg/mL) in the HIIT group compared to the baseline. There were no significant differences between groups for body weight, body mass index, fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, sex hormone binding globulin, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, adipokines, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1;, or interleukin-10. HIIT can be used as a safe, feasible, and time-efficient intervention to improve cardiovascular fitness in breast cancer patients. Both HIIT and MICT modalities enhance quality of life. Further large-scale studies will help determine whether these promising results translate into improved clinical and oncological outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 that induces a generalized inflammatory state. Organokines (adipokines, osteokines, myokines, hepatokines, and cardiokines) can produce beneficial or harmful effects in this condition. This study aimed to systematically review the role of organokines on COVID-19. PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, and Cochrane databases were searched, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed, and 37 studies were selected, comprising more than 2700 individuals infected with the virus. Among COVID-19 patients, organokines have been associated with endothelial dysfunction and multiple organ failure due to augmented cytokines and increased SARS-CoV-2 viremia. Changes in the pattern of organokines secretion can directly or indirectly contribute to aggravating the infection, promoting immune response alterations, and predicting the disease progression. These molecules have the potential to be used as adjuvant biomarkers to predict the severity of the illness and severe outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Adipose tissue plays an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory conditions. The role of adipokines in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been evaluated in the current literature with conflicting results. The aim of this study was to evaluate adiponectin levels in IBD patients, including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), compared to controls, as well as further subgroup analyses. Hence, assessing the potential role of adiponectin as a surrogate marker. We performed a systematic electronic search on PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library, including observational or interventional studies evaluating serum or plasma adiponectin levels in IBD patients in humans. The primary summary outcome was the mean difference (MD) in serum or plasma adiponectin levels between IBD patients versus controls. Subgroup analyses were conducted involving adiponectin levels in CD and UC compared to controls, as well as CD compared to UC. A total of 20 studies were included in our qualitative synthesis and 14 studies in our quantitative synthesis, with a total population sample of 2,085 subjects. No significant MD in serum adiponectin levels was observed between IBD patients versus controls {-1.331 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -3.135-0.472)}, UC patients versus controls (-0.213 [95% CI: -1.898-1.472]), and CD patients versus controls (-0.851 [95% CI: -2.263-0.561]). Nevertheless, a significant MD was found between UC patients versus CD patients (0.859 [95% CI: 0.097-1.622]). Serum adiponectin levels were not able to differentiate between IBD, UC, and CD patients compared to controls. However, significantly higher serum adiponectin levels were observed in UC compared to CD patients.",

    "title": "Resistance exercise training augments the immunomodulatory adaptations to aerobic high-intensity interval training.",
    "abstract": "To compare the effectiveness of different types of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on meta-inflammation during obesity, TLR4 pathway activities were assessed following a 10-week randomized trial. 30 young females with overweight and obesity were randomly allocated to aerobic HIIT (HIIT/AE) or resistance exercise in HIIT (HIIT/RE) and performed a 28-minute (4&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;4 min) in each session. During each interval, the HIIT/AE performed four minutes of all-extremity cycling, whereas the HIIT/RE completed four minutes of combined resistance exercises and all-extremity cycling. The TLR4 pathway gene expression was measured for the TLR4 receptor, downstream adaptors (TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-&#x3b2; (TRIF) and myeloid differentiation factor (MYD) 88), transcriptional factors (nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#x3ba;B), and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3), and its negative regulator (tumor necrosis factor (TNF) a-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3)). The serum levels of TNF&#x3b1;, interferon (IFN) &#x3b3;, interleukin (IL)-10, and adiponectin were measured. We found that TLR4 (HIIT/RE: 0.6&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.43 vs. HIIT/AE: 1.24&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.82, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02), TRIF (HIIT/RE: 0.51&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.4 vs. HIIT/AE: 3.56&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.52, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001), and IRF3 (HIIT/RE: 0.49&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.42 vs. HIIT/AE: 0.6&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.89; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04) levels were significantly downregulated in HIIT/RE compared to the HIIT/AE, with a significant reduction in serum levels of TNF&#x3b1; (pg/ml) (HIIT/RE: 22.5&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;11.3 to 6.3&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.3 vs. HIIT/AE: 19.16&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;20.8 to 13.48&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;21.7, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04) and IFN&#x3b3; (pg/ml) (HIIT/RE: 43.5&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;20.6 to 37.5&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.3 vs. HIIT/AE: 37.6&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.6 to 68.1&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;22.5, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03). Adiponectin and IL-10 levels did not significantly differ between the two groups. Thus, resistance exercise training augments the immunomodulatory adaptations to HIIT and should be prescribed to people at risk of cardiometabolic disease.Highlights HIIT in combination with resistance exercise looks more effective than HIIT alone to target TLR4-mediated inflammation in individuals with overweight and obesity.HIIT/RE induces a different effect on two downstream cascades of TLR4, leading to a greater overall reduction of TRIF-dependent pathway activities compared to MYD88.Both HIIT protocols show comparable effects on the negative regulatory protein TNFAIP3 gene expression.",

Consumption of individual nut types decreases these risk factors but knowledge about the effect of mixed nuts on Lp(a) is limited. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of consuming 42.5&#xa0;g/day of mixed nuts on LDL-C, Lp(a), and inflammatory markers in individuals with overweight or obesity. In a 16-week randomized control trial, 29 participants with overweight or obesity (BMI 25-40&#xa0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) consumed either 42.5&#xa0;g/day of mixed nuts (cashews, almonds, macadamia nuts, Brazil nuts, pecans, pistachios, walnuts, and peanuts) or 69&#xa0;g/day isocaloric pretzels. Blood samples were collected at baseline, week 8, and week 16 for analysis on total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, Lp(a), inflammation markers, glucose, insulin, adiponectin and liver function enzymes. No significant differences were seen in TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, Lp(a), or liver function enzymes between the two groups. Participants consuming mixed nuts had significantly lower body fat percentage and diastolic blood pressure, and higher adiponectin (all P&#xa0;&#x2264;&#xa0;0.05). C-reactive protein (CRP) and 8-oxo-deoxyguanosis (8-oxodG) showed non-significant decreasing trends and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) had a non-significant increasing trend in the mixed nut group. Consumption of mixed nuts had no evidence of an effect on LDL-C or Lp(a) throughout the intervention. Notably, mixed nut consumption lowered body fat percentage without significant changes in body weight or BMI. Future studies with larger sample sizes investigating the changing trends of CRP, 8-oxodG, and TAC are warranted. NCT03375866.",

    "title": "Lipid profile after omega-3 supplementation in neonates with intrauterine growth retardation: a randomized controlled trial.",
    "abstract": "Neonates with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) have a high lipid profile that predisposes them to cardiovascular disease later in life. We aimed to evaluate the effect of omega 3 supplementation on serum leptin level, lipid profile, and growth in neonates with IUGR. This clinical trial was conducted on 70 full-term neonates with IUGR. Neonates were randomly divided into two equal groups; the treatment group: received omega 3 supplement (40&#x2009;mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks after the establishment of full feeding, and the control group, who were followed up to full feeding without any supplementation. Serum leptin level, total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and anthropometric measurement were evaluated at admission and after 2 weeks of omega 3 supplementation in both groups. After treatment, HDL significantly increased, unlike TC, TG, LDL, LDL, and serum leptin levels, which significantly decreased in the treatment group compared to the control group after treatment. Interestingly, weight, length, and ponderal index greatly increased in omega 3-treated neonates compared to the control group. Omega 3 supplementations lowered serum leptin level, TG, TC, LDL, and VLDL but increased HDL and growth in neonates with IUGR. The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05242107). Neonates with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) were reported to have a high lipid profile that predisposes them to cardiovascular disease later in life. Leptin is a hormone that adjusts dietary intake and body mass and has a significant role in fetal development. Omega 3 is known to be essential for neonatal growth and brain development. We aimed to evaluate the effect of omega 3 supplementation on serum leptin level, lipid profile, and growth in neonates with IUGR. We found that omega 3 supplementations lowered serum leptin level and serum lipid profile but increased high density lipoprotein and growth in neonates with IUGR.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to systemically review the evidence on the relationship between the circulating leptin levels and osteoarthritis (OA), and the association between leptin and leptin receptor (LEPR) polymorphisms and OA susceptibility. To find relevant papers (up to February 2023) examining the association between circulating leptin levels, LEPR polymorphisms, and OA, the PUBMED, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched. We performed a meta-analysis to examine the levels of synovial and serum/plasma leptin in OA patients compared with healthy controls, as well as the relationship between OA and LEPR polymorphisms. Data from 15 investigations, totaling 2197 patients with OA and 2546 controls, were included in the meta-analysis. There were statistically significant differences in the levels of circulating leptin between the OA and control groups (standardized mean difference [SMD] 2.178, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.208-3.139, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001). Leptin levels were also substantially greater in European, Asian, and Arab groups among OA patients. After adjusting for age, sex, and/or body mass index, the leptin levels of patients with OA were significantly higher. Similarly, regardless of sample size (n&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;100 and n&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;100) or year of publication, leptin levels were considerably higher in the OA group. In addition, the synovial leptin level was greater in the OA group than in the control group (SMD 0.783; 95% CI 0.247-1.319, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004). In the LEPR rs1137101 polymorphism, the OA and AA genotypes were significantly associated (odds ratio 0.282, 95% CI 0.126-0.629, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002), according to the meta-analysis. Ethnic stratification revealed an association between OA and the LEPR rs1137101 AA genotype in Asian and Arab populations. The results of this meta-analysis indicate that patients with OA had considerably greater levels of circulating leptin than did control individuals. In addition, synovial leptin levels were greater in OA patients than in healthy individuals, and the LEPR rs1137101 polymorphism was linked to an increased risk of developing OA. These results imply that leptin participates in the onset and progression of OA.",

    "abstract": "Midlife obesity and late-life weight loss confer a greater risk for developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the exact mechanisms behind this phenomenon are currently unknown. The answer could lie on the involvement of gastrointestinal factors, such as adipokines (e.g., leptin, adiponectin, and resistin) and ghrelin. In this context, we conducted a pre-registered systematic review and meta-analysis of 42 cross-sectional and 13 longitudinal studies targeting the associations between leptin, adiponectin, resistin, and ghrelin and the prevalence of general dementia, AD, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We also examined the relationship between the four gastrointestinal factors and neurocognitive outcomes and AD-related cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. Patients with AD had lower blood leptin and higher resistin levels than cognitively normal participants. Lower leptin and higher resistin were associated with higher degree of cognitive impairment. Additionally, lower late-life leptin levels might be associated with higher prospective risk of dementia and AD, although more studies are needed to corroborate this. Results in ghrelin and adiponectin were not conclusive, with age, sex distribution, obesity, and severity of dementia seemingly acting as moderators across several analyses. Our work might contribute to the identification of new preclinical blood markers of MCI and AD.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is closely associated with omentin, a novel adipokine that plays a vital role in metabolic balance. The literature about the relationship between circulating omentin and MAFLD is conflicting. Therefore, this meta-analysis evaluated circulating omentin levels in patients with MAFLD compared with healthy controls to explore the role of omentin in MAFLD. The literature search was performed up to April 8, 2022, using PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CNKI, Wanfang, CBM, Clinical Trials Database and Grey Literature Database. This meta-analysis pooled the statistics in Stata and presented the overall results using the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Twelve studies with 1624 individuals (927 cases and 697 controls) were included, and all of them were case-control studies. In addition, ten of twelve included studies were conducted on Asian participants. Patients with MAFLD had significantly lower circulating omentin levels than healthy controls (SMD=-0.950 [-1.724, -0.177], P=0.016). Subgroup analysis and meta-regression demonstrated that fasting blood glucose (FBG) might be the source of heterogeneity and was inversely associated with omentin levels (coefficient=-0.538, P=0.009). No significant publication bias existed (P&gt;0.05), and outcomes were robust in the sensitivity analysis. Lower circulating omentin levels were associated with MAFLD, and FBG might be the source of heterogeneity. Since Asian studies accounted for a significant portion of the meta-analysis, the conclusion might be more applicable to the Asian population. By investigating the relationship between omentin and MAFLD, this meta-analysis laid the foundation for the development of diagnostic biomarkers and treatment targets. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier CRD42022316369.",

    "abstract": "Myokines represent important regulators of muscle metabolism. Our study aimed to explore the effects of a cyclical ketogenic reduction diet (CKD) vs. a nutritionally balanced reduction diet (RD) combined with regular resistance/aerobic training in healthy young males on serum concentrations of myokines and their potential role in changes in physical fitness. Twenty-five subjects undergoing regular resistance/aerobic training were randomized to the CKD (n = 13) or RD (n = 12) groups. Anthropometric and spiroergometric parameters, muscle strength, biochemical parameters, and serum concentrations of myokines and cytokines were assessed at baseline and after 8 weeks of intervention. Both diets reduced body weight, body fat, and BMI. Muscle strength and endurance performance were improved only by RD. Increased musclin (32.9 pg/mL vs. 74.5 pg/mL, p = 0.028) and decreased osteonectin levels (562 pg/mL vs. 511 pg/mL, p = 0.023) were observed in RD but not in the CKD group. In contrast, decreased levels of FGF21 (181 pg/mL vs. 86.4 pg/mL, p = 0.003) were found in the CKD group only. Other tested myokines and cytokines were not significantly affected by the intervention. Our data suggest that changes in systemic osteonectin and musclin levels could contribute to improved muscle strength and endurance performance and partially explain the differential effects of CKD and RD on physical fitness.",

    "title": "Long-term effects of different exercise training modes on cytokines and adipokines in individuals with overweight/obesity and cardiometabolic diseases: A systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression of randomized controlled trials.",
    "abstract": "The present study aimed to investigate the evidence on the effects of different long-term training interventions (aerobic [AeT], resistance [RT], and combined [COMB]) and spontaneous physical activity (PA) in modifying cytokines and adipokines in individuals with overweight or obesity with or without cardiometabolic diseases while considering potential confounders. Although exercise interventions have become a potentially effective tool for preventing and treating metabolic diseases, the evidence provided by previous systematic reviews is inconclusive since several potential confounders have yet to be addressed. Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature search in Medline, Cochrane, and Embase databases from January 2000 to July 2022 and performed a meta-analysis. Inclusion criteria retrieved 106 full texts comprising 8,642 individuals with a range BMI of 25.1-43.8&#xa0;kg&#x2009;m<sup>-2</sup> . We found that independently of the training mode, exercise had a beneficial effect on diminishing Adiponectin, C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, IL-18, IL-20, Leptin, sICAM, and TNF-&#x3b1; levels circulating levels. Furthermore, by subsequent analysis, we detected differential effects of AeT, RT, and COMB, with sex, age, body composition, and trial length acting as moderators. The comparison of training modes revealed a difference favoring COMB over AeT for regulating the increase in CRP with no differences in the remaining biomarkers. Meta-regression analysis revealed an effect of change in maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max ) on CRP, IL-6, and TNF-&#x3b1;, while IL-10 was influenced by the change in body fat. The results suggest that all interventions, except PA, are effective in lessening this population's inflammatory status, provided that exercise results in an increase of VO2max .",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have focused on the order of endurance and resistance training when performing concurrent training (CT). However, no study has compared the effects of combined training with CT orders on inflammatory markers, muscular performance, and body composition in overweight and obese males. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to compare the effects of 12 weeks of CT and combined training on the aforementioned markers in overweight and obese males. Sixty middle-aged overweight and obese males (age 51 &#xb1; 4 years) were randomly assigned into one of four groups: endurance followed by resistance training (ER; n = 15), resistance followed by endurance training (RE; n = 15), combined resistance and endurance training (COM), or control (CON; n = 15). Anthropometric, body composition, inflammatory marker, and muscular performance measurements were collected at baseline and after 12 weeks. FFM remained unchanged in all three intervention groups (p &gt; 0.05). Reductions in FM in the RE group were significantly greater than in CON (p = 0.038). The increases in serum concentrations of adiponectin in the RE group were significantly greater than in all other groups (p &lt; 0.05). Increased serum concentrations of CTRP3 in all intervention groups were significantly greater than the CON group (p &lt; 0.05); moreover, the increases in the RE group were significantly greater than CON (p &lt; 0.001). Regarding CTRP5, the increase in RE was significantly greater than COM (p = 0.014). The RE group experienced significantly greater increases in CTRP9 than all other groups (p &lt; 0.05), and the decreases in serum concentrations of CRP and TNF-&#x3b1; were significantly greater in the RE group compared to CON and ER (p &lt; 0.05). Vo2max in the ER group was significantly greater than COM (p = 0.009), and all interventions resulted in higher gains compared to CON (p &lt; 0.05). The increases in leg press strength, chest press strength, lower-body power, and upper-body power in the RE group were significantly greater than in the COM group (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, the increases in chest press strength in the ER group were significantly greater than COM (p = 0.023). Regardless of training order, CT improved inflammatory markers, body composition, power, and VO2max. Notably, our analysis indicated significantly greater improvements in adiponectin, CTRP5, CTRP9, CRP, and TNF-&#x3b1; levels when RT preceded ET in CT sessions compared to other exercise training sequences. These findings suggested that the order of exercise training may have a significant impact on the effectiveness of CT on inflammatory markers, which has potential implications for exercise prescription and optimization of health-related training outcomes.",

However, the results of these studies are not consistent. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis were designed to comprehensively evaluate the effect of CLA supplementation on inflammatory cytokines and adipokines. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the effects of CLA supplementation on C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#x3b1;), adiponectin, and leptin, published up to March 2022, were identified through PubMed, SCOPUS, and ISI Web of Science databases. A random-effects model was used to calculate weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for 42 studies that included 1,109 participants. Findings from 42 studies with 58 arms indicated that CLA supplementation significantly decreased IL-6 and TNF-&#x3b1; levels and also slightly increased CRP levels. However, adiponectin and leptin levels did not change after CLA supplementation. A subgroup analysis found that CLA supplementation reduced adiponectin and leptin in women. Our results demonstrated that CLA supplementation increased CRP levels and decreased TNF-&#x3b1; and IL-6 levels. Therefore, it seems that CLA can have both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory roles. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier (CRD42022331110).",

We investigated the effect of supplementation of vitamin B12 with or without folic acid for 6 mo in early childhood on cardiometabolic risk markers after 6-7 y. This is a follow-up study of a 2 &#xd7; 2 factorial, double-blind, randomized controlled trial of vitamin B12 and/or folic acid supplementation in 6-30-mo-old children. The supplement contained 1.8 &#x3bc;g of vitamin B12, 150 &#x3bc;g of folic acid, or both, constituting &gt;1 AI or recommended daily allowances for a period of 6 mo. Enrolled children were contacted again after 6 y (September 2016-November 2017), and plasma concentrations of tHcy, leptin, high molecular weight adiponectin, and total adiponectin were measured (N = 791). At baseline, 32% of children had a deficiency of either vitamin B12 (&lt;200 pmol/L) or folate (&lt;7.5 nmol/L). Combined supplementation of vitamin B12 and folic acid resulted in 1.19 &#x3bc;mol/L (95% CI: 0.09; 2.30 &#x3bc;mol/L) lower tHcy concentration 6 y later compared to placebo. We also found that vitamin B12 supplementation was associated with a lower leptin-adiponectin ratio in subgroups based on their nutritional status. Supplementation with vitamin B12 and folic acid in early childhood was associated with a decrease in plasma tHcy concentrations after 6 y. The results of our study provide some evidence of persistent beneficial metabolic effects of vitamin B12 and folic acid supplementation in impoverished populations.

Myo-inositol hexaphosphate (phytate; InsP6) is a natural compound that is abundant in cereals, legumes, and nuts that has demonstrated to have different beneficial properties in patients with diabetes type 2. We performed a randomized crossover trial to investigate the impact of daily consumption of InsP6 on serum levels of adiponectin, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;39). Thus, we measure serum levels of these inflammatory markers, classic vascular risk factors, and urinary InsP6 at baseline and at the end of the intervention period. Patients who consumed InsP6 supplements for 3 months had higher levels of adiponectin and lower HbA1c than those who did not consume InsP6. No differences were found in TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta. This is the first report to show that consumption of InsP6 increases plasma adiponectin concentration in patients with T2DM. Consequently, our findings indicate that following a phytate-rich diet has beneficial effects on adiponectin and HbA1c concentrations and it could help to prevent or minimize diabetic-related complications.",

The cumulative results showed that post-AET inflammatory markers were lower in exercise-treated patients compared to controls regarding CRP (mg/L): WMD: -0.91; 95%CIs: -1.43, -0.40; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001 resistin (mg/ml): (WMD: -2.08; 95%CIs: -3.32, -0.84; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001); TNF-a (pg/ml): (WMD: -2.70; 95%CIs: -4.26, -1.14; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001), and IL-6 (pg/ml): (WMD: -1.05; 95%CIs: -1.68, -0.43; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001). Those effects were accompanied by significant amelioration of fasting glucose (mg/dl) (WMD: -13.02; 95%CIs: -25.39, -0.66; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.04), HbA1c (%) (WMD: -0.51; 95%CIs: -0.73, -0.28, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001), and fat mass (%) (WMD: -3.14; 95%CI: -4.71, -1.58; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001). Our meta-analysis demonstrated less-consistent results for adiponectin (&#x3bc;g/ml), (WMD: 1.00; 95%CI: -0.12, 2.12; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.08) and body-mass index (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) (WMD: -1.34; 95%CI: -2.76, 0.08; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.06) tending to differ between AET and control group. AET can significantly reduce the inflammatory burden in T2DM patients. by ameliorating the circulating levels of CRP, resistin, TNF-a and IL-6, even without accompanied significant weight-loss. The clinical impact of those anti-inflammatory effects of AET needs to be determined.",

    "abstract": "Homozygous leptin (LEP) and leptin receptor (LEPR) variants lead to childhood-onset obesity. To present new cases with LEP and LEPR deficiency, report the long-term follow-up of previously described patients, and to define, based on all reported cases in literature, genotype-phenotype relationships. Our cohort included 18 patients (LEP = 11, LEPR = 7), 8 of whom had been previously reported. A systematic literature review was conducted in July 2022. Forty-two of 47 studies on LEP/LEPR were selected. Of 10 new cases, 2 novel pathogenic variants were identified in LEP (c.16delC) and LEPR (c.40 + 5G &gt; C). Eleven patients with LEP deficiency received metreleptin, 4 of whom had been treated for over 20 years. One patient developed loss of efficacy associated with neutralizing antibody development. Of 152 patients, including 134 cases from the literature review in addition to our cases, frameshift variants were the most common (48%) in LEP and missense variants (35%) in LEPR. Patients with LEP deficiency were diagnosed at a younger age [3 (9) vs 7 (13) years, P = .02] and had a higher median body mass index (BMI) SD score [3.1 (2) vs 2.8 (1) kg/m2, P = 0.02], which was more closely associated with frameshift variants (P = .02). Patients with LEP deficiency were more likely to have hyperinsulinemia (P = .02). Frameshift variants were more common in patients with LEP deficiency whereas missense variants were more common in LEPR deficiency. Patients with LEP deficiency were identified at younger ages, had higher BMI SD scores, and had higher rates of hyperinsulinemia than patients with LEPR deficiency. Eleven patients benefitted from long-term metreleptin, with 1 losing efficacy due to neutralizing antibodies.",

    "title": "Effect of Dietary Intervention, with or without Cointerventions, on Inflammatory Markers in Patients with Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a spectrum of disease from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, with inflammatory cytokines and adipokines identified as drivers of disease progression. Poor dietary patterns are known to promote an inflammatory milieu, although the effects of specific diets remain largely unknown. This review aimed to gather and summarize new and existing evidence on the effect of dietary intervention on inflammatory markers in patients with NAFLD. The electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane were searched for clinical trials which investigated outcomes of inflammatory cytokines and adipokines. Eligible studies included adults &gt;18 y with NAFLD, which compared a dietary intervention with an alternative diet or control (no intervention) group or were accompanied by supplementation or other lifestyle interventions. Outcomes for inflammatory markers were grouped and pooled for meta-analysis where heterogeneity was allowed. Methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed using the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Criteria. Overall, 44 studies with a total of 2579 participants were included. Meta-analyses indicated intervention with an isocaloric diet plus supplement was more effective in reducing C-reactive protein (CRP) [standard mean difference (SMD): 0.44; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.68; P = 0.0003] and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#x3b1;) (SMD: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.02, 1.46; P = 0.03) than an isocaloric diet alone. No significant weighting was shown between a hypocaloric diet with or without supplementation for CRP (SMD: 0.30; 95% CI: -0.84, 1.44; P = 0.60) and TNF-&#x3b1; (SMD: 0.01; 95% CI: -0.43, 0.45; P = 0.97). In conclusion, hypocaloric and energy-restricted diets alone or with supplementation, and isocaloric diets with supplementation were shown to be most effective in improving the inflammatory profile of patients with NAFLD. To better determine the effectiveness of dietary intervention alone on a NAFLD population, further investigations of longer durations, with larger sample sizes are required.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a global epidemic disease representing the fifth leading cause of death in the world. It was shown that it is caused by the interaction between environmental factors and genes including leptin gene (LEP). This paper aimed to analyze the association between the LEP gene polymorphisms rs7799039 and rs11761556 with obesity in Moroccan individuals as well as to perform an update meta-analysis of this genetic association. Both polymorphisms were genotyped in 146 obesity patients and 104 controls using real-time PCR technique. The genetic association analysis and the comparison of quantitative parameters were carried out using the R language. Moreover, a meta-analysis including 20 genetic association studies was performed using Review Manager 5.3 software. No significant association was found between the polymorphisms rs7799039 and rs11761556&#xa0;and the risk of obesity. The comparison of biochemical and clinical parameters between the genotypes of the rs7799039 polymorphism, showed a significant increased triglycerides levels in carriers of AA or GA genotypes (P value&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.040). The meta-analysis showed no significant association between the rs7799039 polymorphism and obesity&#xa0;under all genetic models. In conclusion, the case-control study and meta-analysis demonstrated that the LEP gene polymorphisms rs7799039 and rs11761556 cannot be considered as genetic risk factors for obesity.",

    "title": "The relationship between adipokine levels and bone mass-A systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Adipose tissue is the source of a broad array of signalling molecules (adipokines), which mediate interorgan communication and regulate metabolic homeostasis. Alterations in adipokine levels have been causally implicated in various metabolic disorders, including changes in bone mass. Osteoporosis is the commonest progressive metabolic bone disease, characterized by elevated risk of fragility fractures as a result of a reduced bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration. The effects of different adipokines on bone mass have been studied in an attempt to identify novel modulators of bone mass or diagnostic biomarkers of osteoporosis. In this review, we sought to aggregate and assess evidence from independent studies that quantify specific adipokines and their effect on bone mineral density (BMD). A literature search identified 57 articles that explored associations between different adipokines and BMD. Adiponectin and leptin were the most frequently studied adipokines, with most studies demonstrating that adiponectin levels are associated with decreased BMD at the lumbar spine and femoral neck. Conversely, leptin levels are associated with increased BMD at these sites. However, extensive heterogeneity with regards to sample size, characteristics of study subjects, ethnicity, as well as direction and magnitude of effect at specific skeletal anatomical sites was identified. The broad degree of conflicting findings reported in this study can be attributed several factors. These include differences in study design and ascertainment criteria, the analytic challenges of quantifying specific adipokines and their isoforms, pre-analytical variables (in particular patient preparation) and confounding effects of co-existing disease. This review highlights the biological relevance of adipokines in bone metabolism and reinforces the need for longitudinal research to elucidate the causal relationship of adipokines on bone mass.",

    "title": "Association between omentin and obstructive sleep apnea: A meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can lead to multisystem and multiorgan damage, which has attracted widespread attention from scholars. The pathogenesis of OSA is complex, and obesity plays an important role. Adipokine is secreted by adipose tissue, and its abnormal expression may be closely related to OSA. The relationship between omentin (a novel adipokine) and OSA is controversial. This study focuses on the important role of omentin in OSA and explores whether it can be regarded as a new target for the diagnosis and treatment of OSA. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane library, WANFANG, VIP, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure were systematically searched for retrieving eligible studies until May 2022. Documents were screened according to strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, and data were extracted using Excel spreadsheets. The quality of the literature was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RevMan 5.3 and Stata 12.0 software were used in this meta-analysis for data synthesis. A total of eight eligible studies with 23 databases involving 914 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Combined data indicated that omentin levels in OSA patients were lower than that in controls (standardized mean difference&#x2009;=&#x2009;-1.54, 95% confidence interval&#x2009;=&#x2009;-2.07 to -1.00, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). According to the subgroup analysis results of different races, sample source, gender, and the severity of the disease, compared with that in the control group, the level of omentin in OSA patients was significantly lower. When conducting sensitivity analysis, the results of the study were less stable. Meta-analysis indicated that there was no publication bias in this study. The omentin levels were significantly lower in OSA patients. The findings suggest that omentin may be a potential marker for the diagnosis and treatment of OSA. However, the heterogeneity of this study is high, and more high-quality large-sample studies will be needed in the future.",

This study aimed to evaluate the association between resistin levels and thyroid dysfunction and to explore variations in circulating resistin levels before and after treatment for thyroid dysfunction. This study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis statement. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases was conducted until June 15, 2022, with no start date restriction, according to the preregistered protocol (PROSPERO-CRD42022336617). RevMan version 5.4 and R software package version 4.2.0 were used for statistical analyses. Fourteen studies with 1716 participants were included in this study. The findings of the meta-analysis confirmed that the resistin levels of patients with thyroid dysfunction were significantly higher than those of the euthyroid function control group (mean difference [MD] = 2.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11-3.11, P &lt; 0.00001). Furthermore, the resistin levels of patients with hyperthyroidism (MD = 3.23, 95% CI = 0.68-5.79, P = 0.01) and subclinical hypoidism (MD = 1.37, 95% CI = 0.31-2.42, P = 0.01) were significantly higher than those of euthyroid controls. The resistin levels of patients with thyroid dysfunction after treatment were significantly lower than those before treatment (MD = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.34-1.65, P = 0.003), especially in patients with hyperthyroidism (MD = 2.16, 95% CI = 1.00-3.32, P = 0.0003). Correlation analysis confirmed a positive correlation between resistin levels and free triiodothyronine (FT3) levels in patients with thyroid dysfunction (r = 0.27578, P = 0.001). Our meta-analysis demonstrates that resistin levels are significantly higher in patients with thyroid dysfunction, and the resistin levels after treatment in patients with thyroid dysfunction are significantly lower than those before treatment.

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 12 weeks of high-intensity training with astaxanthin supplementation on adipokine levels, insulin resistance and lipid profiles in males with obesity. Sixty-eight males with obesity were randomly stratified into four groups of seventeen subjects each: control group (CG), supplement group (SG), training group (TG), and training plus supplement group (TSG). Participants underwent 12 weeks of treatment with astaxanthin or placebo (20 mg/d capsule daily). The training protocol consisted of 36 sessions of high-intensity functional training (HIFT), 60 min/sessions, and three sessions/week. Metabolic profiles, body composition, anthropometrical measurements, cardio-respiratory indices and adipokine [Cq1/TNF-related protein 9 and 2 (CTRP9 and CTRP2) levels, and growth differentiation factors 8 and 15 (GDF8 and GDF15)] were measured. There were significant differences for all indicators between the groups (p &lt; 0.05). Post-hoc analysis indicated that the levels of CTRP9, CTRP2, and GDF8 were different from CG (p &lt; 0.05), although levels of GDF15 were similar to CG (p &gt; 0.05). Levels of GDF8 were similar in the SG and TG groups (p &gt; 0.05), with reductions of GDF15 levels in both training groups (p &lt; 0.05). A total of 12 weeks of astaxanthin supplementation and exercise training decreased adipokines levels, body composition (weight, %fat), anthropometrical factors (BMI), and improved lipid and metabolic profiles.

    "abstract": "The published findings on the link between the resistin (RETN) gene polymorphism and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) risk are still contradictory. Here, through a meta-analysis, we summarized a more precise evaluation of their connection by synthesizing existing research. PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science were electronically searched, and all cited sources were manually searched. The heterogeneity of effects was tested and all statistical analyses were performed in Stata 12.0. A total of 23 studies with 10,651 cases and 14,366 controls on RETN -420C/G polymorphism were included. The overall results showed that the association of RETN -420C/G polymorphism and T2DM susceptibility was not significant [for the allelic model: odds ratio (OR) = 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.87-1.10, pheterogeneity &lt;.001; I <sup>2</sup> = 84.6%; for the dominant model: OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.80-1.15, pheterogeneity &lt;.001; I <sup>2</sup> = 87.1%; and for the recessive model: OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.82-1.12, pheterogeneity &lt;.001; I <sup>2</sup> = 56.9%] but with high heterogeneity across studies (p &lt;.0001). Meta-regression found that the median age of T2DM participants (using age 50 as the cutoff) could be a factor in the observed variation. The RETN -420C/G polymorphism seems to be linked to an increased risk of T2DM in younger individuals [for dominant: OR = 0.84 (95% CI, 0.72-0.98; pheterogeneity &lt;.001; I <sup>2</sup> = 80.9%)] and decreased risk in older people [for dominant: OR = 3.14 (95% CI, 2.35-4.19; pheterogeneity = .98; I <sup>2</sup> = 0.0%)]. Current results found no evidence that the RETN -420C/G variant was linked to T2DM susceptibility, but the patient's age appears to be a potential factor that contributed to high heterogeneity across studies. Additional high-quality and well-designed investigations are required to confirm these results.",

    "title": "Role of Leptin as a Link between Asthma and Obesity: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
    "abstract": "Asthma and obesity are considered as highly prevalent diseases with a great impact on public health. Obesity has been demonstrated to be an aggravating factor in the pathogenesis of asthma. Adipose tissue secretes proinflammatory cytokines and mediators, including leptin, which may promote the development and severity of asthma in obese patients. This study is a systematic review and a meta-analysis based on the relationship between leptin and asthma during obesity. MEDLINE, Cochrane, EMBASE and CINAHL databases were used. Data heterogeneity was analyzed using Cochran&#x2019;s Q and treatment effect with the DerSimonian and Laird method. Random effect analyses were carried out to test data sensitivity. Asymmetry was estimated using Begg&#x2019;s and Egger&#x2019;s tests. All studies showed significant differences in leptin levels. The effect of the measures (p &lt; 0.001), data sensitivity (p &lt; 0.05) and data asymmetry were statistically significant, as well as tBegg&#x2019;s test (p = 0.010) and Egge&#x2019;s test (p &lt; 0.001). Despite the existing limiting factors, the results of this study support the relevant role of leptin in the pathophysiology of asthma in obese subjects. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to obtain better insight in the relationship between leptin and asthma in obesity.",

    "title": "Change in Adipokines and Gastrointestinal Hormones After Bariatric Surgery: a Meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "The study aimed to perform a meta-analysis about the change in adipokines and gastrointestinal hormones after bariatric surgery in patients with obesity. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, and PubMed for related articles and used Review Manager 5.4 for data aggregation. Sensitivity and subgroup analysis were also conducted when feasible. As a result, 95 articles involving 6232 patients were included in the meta-analysis. After bariatric surgery, the levels of leptin, ghrelin, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP), tumor necrosis, factor-&#x3b1; (TNF-&#x3b1;), and interleukin-1&#x3b2; (IL-1&#x3b2;) reduced, while adiponectin, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and peptide YY (PYY) levels increased significantly. Subgroup analysis indicated that there was a more significant reduction in leptin level with a longer follow-up time. OAGB had a greater effect on increasing adiponectin level compared with other procedures. SG procedure would bring about reduced ghrelin, while BPD resulted in increased ghrelin. Meta-regression analysis found that publication year, study design, number of patients, preoperative age, preoperative BMI, and quality assessment score were not significantly related to change in leptin, adiponectin, and ghrelin levels. Bariatric surgery was associated with a significant decrease in leptin, ghrelin, CRP, IL-6, Hs-CRP, TNF-&#x3b1;, and IL-1&#x3b2;, as well as increase in adiponectin, GLP-1, and PYY levels.",

    "abstract": "Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory disease manifesting in inverse body regions. In a systematic review, the role of hormones in HS will be presented to better understand the pathomechanisms of HS. The review is based on the PRISMA criteria. Systematic research was carried out using keywords. Subsequently, the data were analyzed based on the clinical response and other relevant information. The main focus of our systematic review was on HS manifestation, exacerbation, sex hormones, antiandrogen therapy, thyroid function, polycystic ovary syndrome, insulin resistance, and adipokines. In HS, there appears to be a dysregulated adipokine release that is shifted towards pro-inflammatory adipokines. Insulin resistance is significantly more common in HS than in healthy patients regardless of BMI, age, and gender. Insulin resistance in HS patients leads to further cardiovascular disease. The mechanism of insulin resistance and role of adipokines should be investigated in future studies to better provide the pathomechanisms of HS. The role of androgens seems to be important in a certain subgroup of female patients. Anti-androgenic therapy can be useful and helpful in some patients. However, further studies are needed to better understand the hormonal relationship in HS.",

    "abstract": "Adipocytokines are signaling molecules secreted by adipose tissue contributing to the control of body fat, energy expenditure and secretion of insulin and cytokines. They have been related to the development of obesity, type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Diet and physical activity (PA) may have beneficial effects on their level. We evaluated the effects of a 24-month dietary and/or PA intervention on plasma levels of adipocytokines as a secondary analysis in the DAMA (Diet, physical Activity and Mammography) trial. The 234 study participants (healthy postmenopausal women with high breast density, 50-69&#xa0;years, non-smokers, no hormone therapy) were randomised to four arms: (1) isocaloric dietary intervention mainly based on plant-foods; (2) moderate-intensity PA intervention with at least 1&#xa0;h/week of supervised strenuous activity; (3) both interventions; (4) general recommendations on healthy dietary and PA patterns. Leptin, resistin and adiponectin were measured at baseline and at the end of the intervention. Analyses were performed using Tobit regression. After 24&#xa0;months, women randomised to PA intervention (arms #2&#x2009;+&#x2009;#3) showed significant lower level of leptin (37.5% lower) and resistin (65.6% lower) compared to the control group (arms #1&#x2009;+&#x2009;#4).

IBR, as well as being beneficial to the organism, can be also responsible for a variety of chronic inflammatory diseases.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of WBV on IBR in different clinical status. This is a systematic review that includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of WBV exercise on IBR. The methodological quality, risk of bias, and level of evidence were rated. Four RCTs met the selection criteria. The studies showed benefits associated with IBR (e.g., cytokines, adipokines, and C-reactive protein) in various clinical conditions, including healthy populations and some chronic diseases (such as obesity, aging disorders, and knee osteoarthritis), using several WBV protocols.

    "abstract": "Obesity plays an important role in the development and progression of breast cancer via various oncogenic pathways. However, the biological mechanisms underlying this relationship are not fully understood. Moreover, it is unclear whether obesity-related and further associated biomarkers could be suitable targets for lifestyle interventions. This systematic review was conducted to examine relationships between obesity-related blood parameters and prognosis for breast cancer survivors enrolled in lifestyle intervention studies. A systematic, computerized literature search was conducted from inception through August 26th, 2020 in PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL. The focus was on observational data from randomized controlled lifestyle intervention trials investigating associations between selected baseline biomarkers, measured in remission, and breast cancer recurrence, breast cancer mortality and/or all-cause mortality. Four studies with data from 5234 women met the inclusion criteria.Studies herein provide moderate evidence that bioavailable or serum testosterone may be positively linked to breast cancer recurrence and inversely linked to disease-free survival. Limited evidence suggests no associations with circulating estradiol or insulin levels on prognosis outcomes, whereas HDL cholesterol was inversely associated with breast cancer recurrence. For some other biomarkers, such as growth factors, adipokines, and CRP, the evidence for associations with disease prognosis was too weak to draw conclusions.Overall, despite potential candidates, there is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute that obesity-related biomarkers and sex hormones have a prognostic value for breast cancer survival. More longitudinal studies in breast cancer survivors to examine the clinical utility of obesity-related biomarkers are needed.",

    "title": "Kidney transplantation: is it a solution to endothelial dysfunction?",
    "abstract": "Endothelial dysfunction is associated with elevated cardiovascular risk in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Kidney transplantation has demonstrated significant ability in reducing mortality and improving quality of life in recipients. Recent studies have also reported improvements in endothelial function following kidney transplantation; however, current literature is limited. We performed a systematic review of PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL databases for prospective cohort studies that assessed endothelial function prior to and following kidney transplantation via various clinical markers. Follow-up duration ranged from 1&#xa0;month to 1&#xa0;year. A meta-analysis of pooled data was conducted using random-effect models for four key markers: brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), nitroglycerin-mediated dilation (NMD), and adiponectin. We included nine studies in our final analysis with a total of 524 patients. Significant improvement of all four biomarkers was observed after transplantation. The mean difference was 2.81% (95% CI 1.92-3.71, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.00001) for FMD, 17.27&#xa0;mg/L (95% CI 5.82-28.72, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003) for hsCRP, 1.05%, (95% CI 0.56-1.54, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001) for NMD, and 9.27&#xa0;&#xb5;g/mL (95% CI 5.96-12.57, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.00001) for adiponectin. There is an immediate reversal of endothelial dysfunction in ESRD patients who undergo kidney transplantation, which may explain observed improvements in cardiovascular morbidity in transplant recipients. Future longitudinal studies are needed to understand possible re-emergence of endothelial dysfunction in the long-term postoperative period.",

A systematic search for relevant studies was performed in 3 databases. Randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of exercise training on at least one of the following exerkines were included: adiponectin, apelin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, fetuin-A, fibroblast growth factor-21, follistatin, ghrelin, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, IL-18, leptin, myostatin, omentin, resistin, retinol-binding protein 4, tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1;, and visfatin. Forty randomized controlled trials were selected for data extraction (n&#x202f;=&#x202f;2160). Exercise training induces changes in adiponectin, fetuin-A, fibroblast growth factor-21, IL-6, IL-10, leptin, resistin, and tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1; levels but has no significant effects on apelin, IL-18, and ghrelin compared to controls. Physical exercise training favored large and positive changes in pooled exerkines (i.e., an overall effect size calculated from several exerkines) (Hedge's g&#x202f;=&#x202f;1.02, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 0.76-1.28), which in turn were related to changes in glycated hemoglobin (mean difference (MD)&#x202f;=&#x202f;-0.81%, 95%CI: -0.95% to -0.67%), fasting glucose (MD&#x202f;=&#x202f;-23.43 mg/dL, 95%CI: -30.07 mg/dL to -16.80 mg/dL), waist circumference (MD&#x202f;=&#x202f;-3.04 cm, 95%CI: -4.02 cm to -2.07 cm), and body mass (MD&#x202f;=&#x202f;-1.93 kg, 95%CI: -2.00 kg to -1.86 kg). Slightly stronger effects were observed with aerobic, resistance, or high-intensity interval protocols at moderate- to vigorous-intensity and with programs longer than 24 weeks that comprise at least 3 sessions per week and more than 60 min per session. Exercise training represents an anti-inflammatory therapy and metabolism-improving strategy with minimal side effects for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

    "abstract": "Obesity may create a mitogenic microenvironment that influences tumor initiation and progression. The obesity-associated adipokine, leptin regulates energy metabolism and has been implicated in cancer development. It has been shown that some cell types other than adipocytes can express leptin and leptin receptors in tumor microenvironments. It has been shown that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) agonists can affect leptin levels and vice versa leptin can affect PPARs. Activation of PPARs affects the expression of several genes involved in aspects of lipid metabolism. In addition, PPARs regulate cancer cell progression through their action on the tumor cell proliferation, metabolism, and cellular environment. Some studies have shown an association between obesity and several types of cancer, including breast cancer. There is some evidence that suggests that there is crosstalk between PPARs and leptin during the development of breast cancer. Through a systematic review of previous studies, we have reviewed the published relevant articles regarding leptin signaling in breast cancer and its crosstalk with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors &#x3b1; and &#x3b3;.",

    "abstract": "Disulfide bond A oxidoreductase-like protein (DsbA-L) is a protein (previously named glutathione S-transferase kappa 1) found primarily in peroxisomes and mitochondria. DsbA-L is a key molecule in the multimer formation of adiponectin (APN), which has anti-obesity and anti-inflammatory properties. In humans, DsbA-L mRNA levels in adipocytes were reported to be negatively correlated with the body mass index (BMI). Therefore, we focused on the clinical significance of the DsbA-L gene in obesity and obesity-related diseases in Japanese subjects. First, we showed that the DsbA-L rs1917760 polymorphism is associated with APN multimerization and a high BMI among participants of the health screening program and that this polymorphism is indirectly associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Second, we showed that the DsbA-L rs1917760 polymorphism was associated with a reduction in the respiratory function and with the elevation of the prevalence of airway obstruction among participants of a health screening program. Finally, we showed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial among healthy volunteers that melinjo seed extract promotes APN multimerization, with a greater association in subjects with the DsbA-L rs1917760 T allele. Through these efforts, we showed that DsbA-L is an important molecule associated with obesity and obesity-related diseases and that it may be a useful target for the treatment or prevention of these diseases.",

    "abstract": "Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is an inflammatory skin condition clinically characterized by recurrent painful deep-seated nodules, abscesses, and sinus tracks in areas bearing apocrine glands, such as axillae, breasts, groins, and buttocks. Despite many recent advances, the pathophysiological landscape of HS still demands further clarification. To elucidate HS pathogenesis, we performed a meta-analysis, set analysis, and a variant calling on selected RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) studies on HS skin. Our findings corroborate the HS triad composed of upregulated inflammation, altered epithelial differentiation, and dysregulated metabolism signaling. Upregulation of specific genes, such as KRT6, KRT16, serpin-family genes, and SPRR3 confirms the early involvement of hair follicles and the impairment of barrier function in HS lesioned skin. In addition, our results suggest that adipokines could be regarded as biomarkers of HS and metabolic-related disorders. Finally, the RNA-Seq variant calling identified several mutations in HS patients, suggesting potential new HS-related genes associated with the sporadic form of this disease. Overall, this study provides insights into the molecular pathways involved in HS and identifies potential HS-related biomarkers.",

In the vitamin D group, there was an increase in adiponectin (+18.6%) and a decrease in resistin (-32.4%, P &lt; 0.05). At the end point, a difference was observed between the PL and vitamin D groups in mean adiponectin and resistin levels (11.5 &#xb1; 5.5 vs 18.5 &#xb1; 21.8 ng/mL, P = 0.047, and 16.5 &#xb1; 3.5 vs 11.7 &#xb1; 3.3 ng/mL, P = 0.027, respectively). There were no significant intervention effects on serum adipsin levels. Daily supplementation with 1,000 IU of vitamin D alone was associated with an increase in adiponectin and a decrease in resistin, suggesting a beneficial effect on the adipokine profile of postmenopausal women with vitamin D deficiency.",

    "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as an independent cardiovascular risk factor has been proposed, but the mechanisms underlying cardiovascular disease is far from being completely elucidated. Leptin, an inflammatory cytokine produced by adipocytes, contributes to the modulation of metabolism, respiratory control, and inflammation, which are factors associated with cardiovascular disease. Serum levels of leptin in children with OSA have shown conflicting results in previous studies. We performed a meta-analysis to clarify the correlation between leptin expression of the OSA patients following the PRISMA. PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were systematically searched for relevant studies, and then independently screened by two researchers, and analyzed the data through STATA version 12.0. In a total of 5 articles including 469 participants, the data analysis showed that serum leptin levels were elevated in children with OSA (MD, 6.36; 95% CI, 0.24-12.49, P&#x2005;&lt;&#x2005;.001), compared to the control group. Subgroup analysis were performed based on body mass index. The results of subgroup analysis demonstrated that the serum leptin concentration was correlated with body mass index in children with OSA (MD, 9.70; 95% CI, 0.22-11.18, P&#x2005;&lt;&#x2005;.001). The serum leptin levels were elevated in children with OSA, compared to the control group. It could add to our developing understanding of the pathogenesis and potential treatments for children with OSA, and help us to recognize the relevance of OSA in determining cardiovascular issues among children.",

This study filled this knowledge gap by evaluating randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating probiotics or synbiotics intake on adipokines, inflammation, and oxidative stress in patients with prediabetes and type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We systematically did search up to March 2022 in PubMed/Medline, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and Cochrane library. A random-effect model was applied to estimate the weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for each outcome. A total of 32 RCTs were included in the meta-analysis.

    "abstract": "olive pomace oil (OPO) is a nutritionally relevant fat due to its high oleic acid content (C18:1) and the presence of a wide range of minor bioactive components. Although numerous in vitro and preclinical studies have been developed to study some of its characteristic components, the health effect of prolonged OPO consumption is unknown. a randomised, blinded, cross-over, controlled clinical trial was carried out in 31 normocholesterolemic and 37 hypercholesterolemic subjects. Participants consumed 45 g/day of OPO or sunflower oil (SO) for 4 weeks, each preceded by a 3-week run-in/wash-out phase with corn oil (CO). regular consumption of OPO and SO had no statistically significant effect on any of the markers related to lipid profile, blood pressure, and endothelial function in both groups, except for eNOS levels, which were close to statistical significance due to the effect of oil (OPO and SO) (p = 0.083). A decrease in visceral fat (p = 0.028) in both groups was observed after OPO intake, accompanied by an increment of leptin (p = 0.017) in the hypercholesterolemic group. reducing visceral fat after prolonged OPO intake might contribute to improve cardiometabolic status, with a potentially positive effect on the vascular tone. Further clinical trials are needed to confirm the present results.",

    "abstract": "C-peptide offers potential as a marker to indicate childhood metabolic outcomes. Measuring C-peptide concentration might have better future utility in the risk stratification of neonates born to overweight or diabetic mothers. Prior research has tried to bring this matter into the light; however, the clinical significance of these associations is still far from reach. Here we sought to investigate the associations between fetomaternal metabolic variables and umbilical cord blood C-peptide concentration. For the present study, 858 pregnant women were randomly selected from among a sub-group of 35,430 Iranian pregnant women who participated in a randomized community non-inferiority trial of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) screening. Their umbilical cord (UC) blood C-peptide concentrations were measured, and the pregnancy variables of macrosomia/large for gestational age (LGA) and primary cesarean section (CS) delivery were assessed. The variation of C-peptide concentrations among GDM and macrosomia status was plotted. Due to the skewed distribution of C-peptide concentration in the sample, median regression analysis was used to identify potential factors related to UC C-peptide concentration. In the univariate model, positive GDM status was associated with a 0.3 (95% CI: 0.06&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.54, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01) increase in the median coefficient of UC blood C-peptide concentration. Moreover, one unit (kg) increase in the birth weight was associated with a 0.25 (95% CI: 0.03&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.47, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03) increase in the median coefficient of UC blood C-peptide concentration. In the multivariate model, after adjusting for maternal age, maternal BMI, and macrosomia status, the positive status of GDM and macrosomia were significantly associated with an increase in the median coefficient of UC blood C-peptide concentration (Coef.= 0.27, 95% CI: 0.13&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.42, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001; and Coef.= 0.34, 95% CI: 0.06&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.63, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02, respectively). UC blood concentration of C-peptide is significantly associated with the incidence of maternal GDM and neonatal macrosomia. Using stratification for maternal BMI and gestational weight gain (GWG) and investigating molecular markers like Leptin and IGF-1 in the future might lay the ground to better understand the link between metabolic disturbances of pregnancy and UC blood C-peptide concentration.",

    "abstract": "Recombinant human leptin (metreleptin) reduces hepatic lipid content in patients with lipodystrophy and overweight patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and relative hypoleptinemia independent of its anorexic action. In rodents, leptin signaling in the brain increases very-low-density lipoprotein triglyceride (VLDL-TG) secretion and reduces hepatic lipid content via the vagus nerve. In this randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial (EudraCT Nr. 2017-003014-22), we tested whether a comparable mechanism regulates hepatic lipid metabolism in humans. A single metreleptin injection stimulated hepatic VLDL-TG secretion (primary outcome) and reduced hepatic lipid content in fasted, lean men (n&#xa0;= 13, age range 20-38 years) but failed to do so in metabolically healthy liver transplant recipients (n&#xa0;= 9, age range 26-62 years) who represent a model for hepatic denervation. In an independent cohort of lean men (n&#xa0;= 10, age range 23-31 years), vagal stimulation by modified sham feeding replicated the effects of metreleptin on VLDL-TG secretion. Therefore, we propose that leptin has anti-steatotic properties that are independent of food intake by stimulating hepatic VLDL-TG export via a brain-vagus-liver axis.",

    "abstract": "The interaction between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiometabolic morbidity and mortality stems from the progressive nature of inflammation underpinning both diseases. Exercise training is considered an effective treatment strategy for T2DM and cardiometabolic diseases. The current systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the effects of exercise training on inflammatory and cardiometabolic risk biomarkers in patients with T2DM. Electronic databases (PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science) were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from inception to January 2022. We used random effects models to estimate weighted mean differences with 95% confidence intervals. Twenty-five RCTs were included (N = 1257 participants; mean age = 52&#xa0;years). Included studies had moderate to good overall methodological quality (TESTEX = 9 (range 7-13). Meta-analysis indicated that exercise training significantly increased adiponectin and decreased fasting insulin, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance, tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1;, interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein (ps &#x2264; 0.05). Subgroup analysis by type of training indicated that aerobic exercise had the most consistent beneficial effects as compared to other types of exercise training; however, there was high heterogeneity among studies. Different types of exercise training increase adiponectin levels and decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-6, and CRP, as well as fasting insulin and insulin resistance markers in patients with T2DM. However, these effects were not beneficial for more commonly measured cardiometabolic risk factors (i.e., lipid profiles). Additional relevant clinical trials are required to confirm these results. This systematic review and meta-analysis was prospectively registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42022307396).",

    "title": "Salivary biomarkers for diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction: A systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) accounts for about 7 million deaths per year worldwide. The early identification of signs and symptoms and the detection of specific serological markers of this disease are mandatory to reach a prompt diagnosis and begin potentially life-saving treatment. Point-of-care technologies applied to salivary diagnostics can provide rapid, simple, low-cost, and accurate measurements of specific markers and can also be used in emergency settings. The present systematic review was developed to answer the following question: Are salivary biomarkers useful in identifying patients with acute myocardial infarction? Following the Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, we selected 17 papers. The critical appraisal and quality assessment were performed following the National Institute of Health and the classification of the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine. Twenty-six salivary biomarkers were explored in association with AMI. Troponins, C-reactive protein, and adiponectin were the most frequently investigated molecules. We found that the evaluated biomarkers had different levels of diagnostic accuracy in discriminating patients with AMI from healthy controls. We also observed a lack of good-quality studies on the association between the occurrence of AMI and the presence of related salivary biomarkers. There is evidence that salivary isoforms of cardiac troponin, C-reactive protein, and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) could be useful markers for the prompt diagnosis of AMI. However, the effective use of these markers as possible substitutes for serological markers should be confirmed by further studies that avoid the bias highlighted in the present review.",

The effect of LCHF on novel insulin resistance biomarkers and the metabolome has not been fully explored. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of an ad libitum 8-week LCHF diet compared with a HCLF diet on CMD markers, the metabolome, and insulin resistance markers. n = 16 adults were randomly assigned to either LCHF (n = 8, &lt;50 g CHO p/day) or HCLF diet (n = 8) for 8 weeks. At weeks 0, 4 and 8, participants provided fasted blood samples, measures of body composition, blood pressure and dietary intake. Samples were analysed for markers of cardiometabolic disease and underwent non-targeted metabolomic profiling. Both a LCHF and HCLF diet significantly (p &lt; 0.01) improved fasting insulin, HOMA IR, rQUICKI and leptin/adiponectin ratio (p &lt; 0.05) levels. Metabolomic profiling detected 3489 metabolites with 78 metabolites being differentially regulated, for example, an upregulation in lipid metabolites following the LCHF diet may indicate an increase in lipid transport and oxidation, improving insulin sensitivity. In conclusion, both diets may reduce type 2 diabetes risk albeit, a LCHF diet may enhance insulin sensitivity by increasing lipid oxidation.",

    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease has become the most common liver disorder worldwide, reaching a prevalence of 60% and 24% in patients with chronic liver disease and the general population, respectively. Liver function is often assessed using standard liver tests such as alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and alkaline phosphatase. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the potential beneficial effects of coffee consumption on liver function are scarce and their results are inconclusive. Some clinical trials have shown a significant increase in adiponectin concentrations following coffee consumption; however, there are few studies in this field. Hence, the hypothesis of this meta-analysis of RCTs is that coffee consumption decreases blood markers of liver function and increases adiponectin concentrations. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed-MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google Scholar databases. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model followed by sensitivity analysis. Meta-analysis of 14 RCTs, including a total of 897 subjects, showed that coffee consumption has no significant effect on alanine aminotransferase (weighted mean difference [WMD], -0.89 mg/mL; 95% CI, -2.90 to 1.12; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.39), aspartate aminotransferase (WMD, -0.29 mg/mL; 95% CI, -1.25 to 0.66; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.55), gamma-glutamyl transferase (WMD, .10 mg/mL; 95% CI, -3.94 to 4.15; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.96), alkaline phosphatase (WMD, -4.60 mg/mL; 95% CI, -9.26 to 0.07; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.05), and lactate dehydrogenase (WMD, -0.65 mg/mL; 95% CI, -10.80 to 9.49; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.90). However, coffee administration significantly increased adiponectin concentrations (WMD, 1.19 mg/mL; 95% CI, 0.08-2.31; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.04). The results of this meta-analysis of RCTs suggest that coffee consumption may improve liver dysfunction through the elevation of adiponectin levels; however, further clinical trials are needed to corroborate our findings.",

    "title": "Gene polymorphism of leptin and risk for heart disease, obesity, and high BMI: a systematic review and pooled analysis in adult obese subjects.",
    "abstract": "Leptin polymorphism (LEP) has been associated with coronary heart disease (CAD), obesity, and high body mass index (BMI). However, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to discover the association because previous studies reached different conclusions. Review Manager, version 5.3.5, and Stata, version 15.0, were used for statistical analysis. We calculated the effect size of the studies using the OR with the corresponding 95% CI, and two-sided (bilateral) p-values of 0.05 were considered significant. To determine heterogeneity among the selected studies, the Q test and I2 statistics were used. Meta-regression was used to examine the disease (heart disease, obesity, and high BMI) and heterogeneity between these subgroups. Eleven studies with 18,984 subjects were included in this study. The G-2548A (rs12112075), rs7799039, and A19G (rs2167270) polymorphisms of the leptin gene (but not the Lys656Asn (rs1805094) polymorphism) are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Our pooled analysis revealed an association between the G-2548A (rs12112075) polymorphism and heart disease, high BMI, and obesity. This indicates that individuals carrying the AA allele are at an increased risk for heart disease, high BMI, and obesity. People with heart failure and coronary artery disease did not have the rs7799039 polymorphism or its alleles linked to them. Combined analysis of data from current and&#xa0;published research suggests that the leptin gene polymorphisms G-2548A (rs12112075), rs7799039, and A19G&#xa0;(rs2167270) (but not the Lys656Asn (rs1805094) polymorphism) are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Further research is needed to understand this association.",

    "abstract": "Chitosan is one of dietary fiber that has received great attention in improving obesity-related markers, but little is known on its effects on adolescents. To analyze the effects of chitosan supplementation on obesity-related cardiometabolic markers and appetite-related hormones in adolescents with overweight or obesity. A randomized clinical trial was performed on 64 adolescents with overweight and obesity, who were randomly allocated to receive chitosan supplementation (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;32) or placebo as control (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;32) for 12&#x2009;weeks. Anthropometric measures, lipid and glycemic profiles, and appetite-related hormones were examined. Sixty-one participants completed study (chitosan&#x2009;=&#x2009;31, placebo&#x2009;=&#x2009;30).

When compared with the placebo group, chitosan supplementation had greater improvement in body weight, body mass index (kg/m<sup>2</sup> and Z-score), waist circumference, as well as insulin, adiponectin, and leptin levels. Differences were significant according to P-value &lt;&#x2009;0.05.

    "abstract": "Secreted by white adipose tissue, asprosin is a newly recognized adipokine whose physiological function is not well comprehended. This study intended to determine the effect of spinning and stationary cycling on serum asprosin levels in overweight women. Forty-five overweight women with BMI&gt;25&#xa0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> in the age range of 30-40&#xa0;years were assigned randomly to&#xa0;three groups of 15 participants: control, spinning (group&#xa0;cycling with music), and stationary bike (individual pedaling on a stationary bike). The participants performed the exercises three sessions per week for six weeks. Lipid profile and asprosin levels were measured by enzymatic and ELISA methods, respectively. Moreover, the paired t-test and one-way ANOVA were employed to make within-group and between-group comparisons, respectively. The stationary cycling and spinning exercise groups experienced significant reductions in weight, BMI, serum triglyceride, and asprosin levels from the pretest to the posttest. The control group showed no statistically significant differences. Serum concentrations of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein only declined in the spinning group. In this regard, neither the control group nor the stationary bicycle exhibited no significant change over time. The spinning group demonstrated a significant rise in high-density lipoprotein levels, which was not observed in the control group. In addition, there was no significant difference in WHR index between the intervention groups. By lowering the serum asprosin level, a spinning exercise program appears to be effective in reducing disorders linked to metabolic diseases in overweight women.",

    "abstract": "The increased prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a critical public health concern. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) milt (salmon milt DNA; SM DNA), a by-product obtained during industrial processing of the pharmaceutical raw material protamine, ameliorates hepatosteatosis in animals. This randomised, double-blind, parallel-group comparative study evaluated the effects of SM DNA on hepatic function in healthy Japanese participants with slightly decreased liver function and high alanine aminotransferase level and body mass index. Fifty participants were included in the study. The participants were divided into the placebo (n = 24) and SM DNA (n = 26) groups and administered equal doses of placebo (dextrin) and SM DNA (530 mg day<sup>-1</sup>), respectively. No significant alleviating effects of SM DNA were observed on the primary (hepatic functions and liver-to-spleen ratio), and secondary (NAFLD fibrosis score, serum protein levels, blood glucose, blood lipids, inflammatory markers, adipokines, cytokines, fatigue scoring, and skin conditions) endpoints. Subsequently, a sex-based subgroup analysis revealed a significant improvement in the primary and secondary outcomes in males ingesting SM DNA compared with those in males who were administered placebo. However, no such effect was observed in females. Overall, this clinical study demonstrated the anti-obesity potential of SM DNA and suggested that SM DNA can benefit hepatic function in males.",

    "abstract": "Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most prevalent diseases in the world, associated with diabetic foot ulcers and impaired wound healing. There is an ongoing need for interventions effective in treating these two problems. Pre-clinical studies in this field rely on adequate animal models. However, producing such a model is near-impossible given the complex and multifactorial pathogenesis of T2DM. A leptin-deficient murine model was developed in 1959 and relies on either dysfunctional leptin (ob/ob) or a leptin receptor (db/db). Though monogenic, this model has been used in hundreds of studies, including diabetic wound healing research. In this study, we systematically summarize data from over one hundred studies, which described the mechanisms underlying wound healing impairment in this model. We briefly review the wound healing dynamics, growth factors' dysregulation, angiogenesis, inflammation, the function of leptin and insulin, the role of advanced glycation end-products, extracellular matrix abnormalities, stem cells' dysregulation, and the role of non-coding RNAs. Some studies investigated novel chronic diabetes wound models, based on a leptin-deficient murine model, which was also described. We also discussed the interventions studied in vivo, which passed into human clinical trials. It is our hope that this review will help plan future research.",

    "title": "Improved Inflammatory and Cardiometabolic Profile After Soft-Tissue Sleep Surgery for Obstructive Sleep Apnea: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with a rise in serum inflammatory markers, which may be attenuated by sleep surgery. To evaluate whether sleep surgery was associated with improved levels of proinflammatory markers in adults with OSA. Two authors independently searched Cochrane, Embase, and PubMed databases from inception through June 14, 2022. Two authors searched the Cochrane, Embase, and PubMed databases for studies comparing preoperative and postoperative levels of serum biomarkers in patients undergoing sleep surgery. Data were extracted from included articles into a structured proforma. Meta-analyses of the standardized mean difference (SMD) were conducted in random-effects models. To ensure relevance to clinicians and patients, the probability of benefit and number needed to treat were calculated for outcomes that demonstrated a statistically significant effect after sleep surgery. The primary outcome was the preoperative and postoperative levels of serum biomarkers in patients undergoing sleep surgery, including C-reactive protein (CRP), glucose, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Data analysis was performed from April to May 2022. Of the 3218 studies screened, 26 studies with 1187 patients (mean [SD] age, 42.8 [11.1] years; 932 [78.5%] men and 255 [21.5%] women) were included. Soft-tissue sleep surgery was associated with a large decrease in CRP (SMD, -0.377; 95% CI, -0.617 to -0.137), total cholesterol (SMD, -0.267; 95% CI, -0.417 to -0.116), LDL (SMD, -0.201; 95% CI, -0.344 to -0.058), IL-6 (SMD, -1.086; 95% CI, -1.952 to -0.221), tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1; (SMD, -0.822; 95% CI, -1.617 to -0.027), triglyceride (SMD, -0.186; 95% CI, -0.301 to -0.071), and leptin (SMD, -0.519; 95% CI, -0.954 to -0.083) in patients with OSA. Meta-regression highlighted that increased age, higher preoperative score for cumulative sleep time percentage with oxyhemoglobin saturation less than 90% (CT90), and greater change in CT90 postoperatively were associated with a greater decrease in serum CRP levels after soft-tissue sleep surgery. A greater reduction in apnea hypopnea index (AHI) was strongly associated with a greater reduction in total cholesterol and LDL. A greater reduction in body mass index and AHI were also associated with a greater increase in HDL. The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis of 26 studies suggest that sleep surgery is associated with decreased levels of CRP, total cholesterol, LDL, triglyceride, IL-6, leptin, and TNF-&#x3b1;, which may improve the inflammatory and cardiometabolic profile of patients who undergo sleep surgery.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin is a recognized antiatherogenic molecule; this study was aimed at clarifying the effects of adiponectin variants on lipid and adiponectin levels. By searching PubMed and Cochrane databases for studies published before March 31, 2022, a total of 86,610 individuals were included in the analysis. Variants of rs2241766 and rs266729 were associated with decreased adiponectin and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), as well as increased triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. In contrast, the rs1501299 variant was correlated with increased adiponectin and HDL-C, as well as decreased TG, TC, and LDL-C levels. Subgroup analysis indicated that the significant effect of the rs2241766 and rs266729 variants on lipid profile was predominant in Chinese, while the significant effect of the rs1501299 variant on lipid profile was primarily in Caucasians. Moreover, a stronger effect of the rs2241766 and rs1501299 variants on LDL-C levels was observed in males, while a considerable effect of the rs266729 variant on LDL-C levels was observed in children. The present study indicated that Chinese with the rs2241766 and rs266729 variants were at high risk of dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, or coronary artery disease (CAD). Males with the rs2241766 variant were at high risk of CAD. Children with the rs266729 variant had a high risk to develop dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and even early onset of CAD in the future. These findings are beneficial to clinical physicians to choose different management strategies for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention.",

Thirty-four studies with 5254 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The results of this study show that there was no significant difference in serum adiponectin level between normoalbuminuria and the control group (mean&#x2009;difference = -0.42, 95% CI [-1.23, 0.40]), while serum adiponectin level was positively correlated with the severity of type 2 diabetic kidney disease. The serum adiponectin level in type 2 diabetic kidney disease patients ranks as macroalbuminuria &gt; microalbuminuria &gt; normoalbuminuria.

    "abstract": "Medications leveraging the leptin, PCSK9, ANGPTL3 and FABP4 pathways are being developed for the treatment of insulin resistance and/or lipid disorders. To evaluate whether these pathways are independent from each other, we assessed the levels of PCSK9, ANGPTL3 and FABP4, in normal subjects and subjects exhibiting HIV and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) induced metabolic syndrome with lipoatrophy and hypoleptinemia. Studies were performed at baseline and during food deprivation for three days with either a placebo or leptin administration at physiological replacement doses to correct fasting induced acute hypoleptinemia and in pharmacological doses. PCSK9, ANGPTL3, FABP4 levels and their correlations to lipoproteins-metabolites were assessed in randomized placebo controlled cross-over studies: a) in 15 normal-weight individuals undergoing three-day admissions in the fed state, in complete fasting with placebo and in complete fasting with leptin treatment in physiologic replacement doses (study 1), b) in 15 individuals day baseline in a fed and three fasting admissions for three days with leptin administered in physiologic, supraphysiologic and pharmacologic doses (study 2), c) in 7 hypoleptinemic men with HIV and HAART-induced lipoatrophy treated with leptin or placebo for two months in the context of a cross over randomized trial (study 3). Circulating ANGPTL3, PCSK9 and FABP4 were markedly elevated in HIV-lipoatrophy and not affected by leptin treatment. PCSK9 levels correlated with lipids and markers of lipid utilization and lipolysis. ANGPTL3 levels correlated with HDL particles and their lipid composition. FABP4 levels were negatively associated with HDL diameter (HDL-D) and composition. PCSK9 and ANGPTL3 levels decreased during food deprivation by ~65&#xa0;% and 30&#xa0;% respectively. Leptin administration at physiologic, supraphysiologic and pharmacologic doses did not affect PCSK9, ANGPTL3 and FABP4 levels. PCSK9, ANGPTL3 and FABP4 levels are associated with markers of lipid metabolism and are higher in HIV-lipoatrophy. PCSK9 and ANGPTL3 but not FABP4 decrease in response to food deprivation. PCSK9 and ANGPTL3 regulation is leptin-independent, suggesting independent pathways for lipid regulation. Thus, combining treatments of leptin with PCSK9 and/or ANGPTL3 inhibitors for metabolic diseases should have additive effects and merit further investigation. ClinicalTrials.gov no.

    "abstract": "The improvements in inflammation and cardiometabolic health play an important role in the prevention and treatment of obesity. However, the interactions between different exercise training (ET) modalities with inflammatory and cardiometabolic biomarkers are not completely understood. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the effects of ET on inflammatory and cardiometabolic health markers in overweight and obese adults. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, MEDLINE, Cochrane, Google Scholar, Scopus and Web of Science up to December 15, 2021. Thirty-five studies including 2752 participants were included and analyzed using a random-effects model to estimate weighted mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The meta-analysis found that ET significantly (P&lt;0.05) increased adiponectin (WMD: 0.72 &#xb5;g/mL; 95% CI: 0.60 to 0.84; SMD=0.65) and maximal oxygen consumption levels (WMD: 5.26 mL.kg.min; 95% CI: 3.84, 6.69; SMD=1.21). Moreover, ET significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced fasting insulin (WMD: -2.40 &#x3bc;IU/mL; 95% CI: -3.43 to -1.37; SMD=-0.87), fasting blood glucose (WMD: -5.41 mg/dL; 95% CI: -7.91, -2.91; SMD=-0.66), insulin resistance (WMD: -0.66; 95% CI: -1.08, -0.24; SMD=-0.66) and triglyceride levels (WMD: -10.88 mg/dL; 95% CI: -17.61, -4.15; SMD=-0.91). No significant changes were observed in interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1;, leptin, C-reactive protein and cholesterol concentrations. Subgroup analysis by type of training indicated that aerobic and resistance exercise had the most consistent beneficial effects as compared to other modalities. Our findings suggest that ET may improve inflammation and cardiometabolic health in overweight and obese adults. Aerobic and resistance training appear to be more beneficial for improving adiponectin, fasting insulin, fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance index and triglyceride levels as compared to other exercise modalities. Further long-term studies are required to confirm and expand on these findings.",

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the most prevalent causes of nontraumatic neurological impairment in young adults. This review aims to determine the impact of exercise on cytokine and adipokine profile levels as inflammatory markers in MS patients across various exercise paradigms. We used specific keywords in PubMed, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, and Scopus to find randomized clinical trials addressing the effects of physical activity and exercise training on inflammatory markers levels in MS patients. The majority of the research showed no considerable changes in IL-6 levels, while three studies reported declining levels after the intervention. Approximately half of the trials observed a change in TNF-&#x3b1; and IL-10 levels after exercise interventions, while the other half showed no meaningful changes. Other markers such as IL-17, IL-4, IL-12, adipokines, and BDNF showed fluctuations in levels. We found no universal agreement on the effects of different exercise training protocols on the serum level of inflammatory markers in patients with MS. More research is needed to fully identify the effects of exercise on cytokines in MS patients.",

    "title": "Intermittent energy restriction ameliorates adipose tissue-associated inflammation in adults with obesity: A randomised controlled trial.",
    "abstract": "Although intermittent energy restriction (IER) seems to be as effective as continuous energy restriction (CER) for weight loss, there is still a need to determine the putative effect of this strategy upon the metabolic-inflammatory status. This study aimed to compare the effects of IER versus CER on cardiometabolic and inflammatory markers, over a 12-week period, in adults with obesity. Twenty-eight Norwegian adults (20-55 years) with obesity [body mass index: 35.4 (3.7) kg/m<sup>2</sup>] from a clinical trial (NCT02169778) who completed a 12-weeks diet-induced weight loss as IER (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;14) or CER (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;14) were included in this study. Cardiometabolic, adipokines and inflammatory markers were evaluated at baseline and after the intervention. Plasma levels of 13 inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IL-1&#x3b2;, IFN-&#x3b1;2, IFN-&#x3b3;, TNF-&#x3b1;, MCP-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17A, IL-18, IL-23, and IL-33) and 4 adipokines (adiponectin, adipsin, leptin and resistin) were measured through multiplex bead-based flow cytometric immunoassays. Both interventions resulted in comparable reductions in fasting glucose and insulin concentrations, lipid profile biomarkers, and adipokines. There were significant differences in HOMA-IR between interventions, with a more pronounced reduction in the IER group (-3.7 vs&#xa0;-1.6, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.040). Inflammatory cytokines and chemokines decreased significantly in the IER group only. Differences in the relative changes of IL-1&#x3b2; (-48.5 vs 58.2%, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.011), IFN-&#x3b3; (-53.2 vs 45.1%, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.023), MCP-1 (-22.0 vs 17.4%, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.023), IL-18 (-40.8 vs 10.1%, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.019), IL-23 (-64.8 vs 44.0%, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.011) and IL-33 (-53.4 vs 35.7%, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.028) were statistically significant between groups, with improvements in the inflammatory profile in the IER group. Our results suggest that a 12-weeks intermittent energy restriction, in comparison to a continuous energy strategy, could be advantageous to reduce inflammation associated with obesity, and consequently improve insulin resistance, regardless of the amount of weight loss.

    "abstract": "There are conflicting data on adiponectin concentrations in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The main aim was to compare circulating total adiponectin concentrations in NAFLD patients with versus without liver fibrosis. A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library. Twenty-two studies comprising 1753 biopsy-proven NAFLD individuals (1290 with and 463 without fibrosis) were included in the meta-analysis. There was no difference in adiponectin concentration between NAFLD patients with versus without fibrosis (standardized mean difference [SMD]: -0.15; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: -0.35 to 0.05). Heterogeneity was moderate among studies (&#x399;<sup>2</sup> : 60%, P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001); no risk of publication bias was observed (Egger's test; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.37). The sensitivity analysis, performed after the exclusion of studies with (i) children/adolescents and morbidly obese patients (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;3) and (ii) adiponectin measurement with other methods than enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;9), revealed significantly lower adiponectin concentrations in NAFLD patients with fibrosis (i) SMD: -0.23, 95% CI: -0.41 to -0.04; (ii) SMD: -0.30, 95% CI: -0.55 to -0.04, respectively). Meta-regression analysis revealed no significant association of adiponectin SMD with age, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, &#x3b3;-glutamyl-transferase, homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance and the proportion of men. Overall, patients with NAFLD and fibrosis had similar adiponectin concentrations with patients with NAFLD without fibrosis. However, adiponectin concentration was lower in NAFLD patients with fibrosis than those without fibrosis within the adult patients without morbid obesity and in studies in which adiponectin was measured with the same method (ELISA).",

The obese girl children in the AE group conducted a 16-week (4 times per week and 60&#x2009;min per time) exercise protocols, and the obese group did not perform regular physical training during 16 weeks of study. Then, the serum leptin level and HRV (time domain and frequency domain) were measured in all subjects before and after AE intervention. (1) After 16-week AE intervention, compared with pre-exercise, LF/HF decreased (P &lt; 0.05), HF, SDNN, and RMSSD significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.01), and there was no significant difference in LF (P &gt; 0.05) in the AE group. Nevertheless, there was no significant change before and after the test in the serum leptin level and HRV of the obese group (P &gt; 0.05, respectively). (2) After 16-week AE intervention, compared with the obese group, SDNN and HF significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05, respectively), LF/HF significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.05) in the AE group, but there was no significant difference in RMSSD and LF between the obese group and AE group. (3) The reduction variables of the serum leptin level before and after the AE intervention are positively correlated with the reduction in the LF/HF (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.478, P &lt; 0.05) and negatively correlated with the increasing in the RMSSD (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.482, P &lt; 0.05). But there is no significant association between the reduction in the serum leptin level and the change of LF, HF, and SDNN (P &gt; 0.05, respectively). 16-week AE significantly reduced the serum leptin level and improved cardiac autonomic function in the obese girl children. Moreover, the reduction in the serum leptin level was associated with the increase in parasympathetic activation and improved sympathetic-vagus balance after AE intervention. More research is needed to see whether the effect of exercise on leptin levels in obese girl children can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in adulthood.",

    "title": "Changes in adiponectin:leptin ratio among older adults with obesity following a 12-month exercise and diet intervention.",
    "abstract": "Excess adiposity is characterized by alterations in adipokine secretion such that circulating leptin concentrations are increased with reductions in adiponectin. An emerging biomarker for the assessment of this adipose tissue (AT) dysfunction is the adiponectin:leptin (AL) ratio. A low AL ratio may be suggestive of dysfunctional AT and, consequently, a heightened cardiometabolic disease risk. This ancillary study investigated the relationship between the AL ratio and cardiometabolic health among community-dwelling older adults with obesity, as well as the effects of a 12-month exercise and diet intervention on changes in the AL ratio. Participants (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;163, 70.2&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.7 years, 38.0% male) were randomized to the exercise only group, exercise&#x2009;+&#x2009;nutrient-dense weight maintenance group (exercise&#x2009;+&#x2009;weight maintenance), or exercise&#x2009;+&#x2009;nutrient-dense caloric restriction of 500&#x2009;kcal/d group (exercise&#x2009;+&#x2009;intentional weight loss) (clinicaltrials.gov #NCT00955903). Total and regional adiposity as determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), anthropometrics, and cardiometabolic biomarkers were assessed at baseline and 12 months. The AL ratio was significantly (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) inversely correlated with body mass index, waist circumference, measures of adiposity, and insulin among all participants at baseline. Among females only, significant positive and inverse correlations were also observed between this ratio and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and the inflammatory biomarkers high sensitivity C-reactive protein and interleukin-6, respectively. While controlling for biological sex, a significant time by intervention group interaction effect (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) was observed such that the AL ratio significantly increased from baseline to study completion among participants in the exercise&#x2009;+&#x2009;weight maintenance group and exercise&#x2009;+&#x2009;intentional weight loss group. Post hoc analysis revealed that the exercise&#x2009;+&#x2009;intentional weight loss group exhibited a significantly greater AL ratio at study completion compared to other groups (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05 all). Results are in support of the AL ratio as a measure of AT dysfunction among older adults. Furthermore, results suggest that a 12-month exercise and diet intervention with intentional weight loss assists in improving the AL ratio in this population.",

Forty patients were randomized to the diet intervention (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;20) or control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;20). Diet intervention consisted of a hypocaloric diet of 1000-1500&#x2009;kcal/day and high protein meal replacements. Co-primary outcomes included change in DAS28 and power Doppler ultrasound (PDUS)-34. Clinical disease activity, imaging, biomarkers, adipokines and patient-reported outcomes were monitored throughout the trial. Recruitment terminated early. All analyses were based on intent-to-treat for a significance level of 0.05. The diet intervention group lost an average 9.5&#x2009;kg/patient, while the control group lost 0.5&#x2009;kg (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3) improved, serum leptin decreased and serum adiponectin increased significantly within the diet group and between the groups (all P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.03). DAS28 decreased, 5.2 to 4.2, within the diet group (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001; -0.51 [95% CI -1.01, 0.00], P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.056, between groups).

Obese RA patients on the diet intervention achieved weight loss. There were significant between group improvements for RAPID3, adiponectin and leptin levels, and positive trends for DAS28 and HAQ-DI. Longer-term, larger weight loss studies are needed to validate these findings, and will allow for further investigative work to improve the clinical management of obese RA patients.

    "abstract": "Some studies conducted on soy isoflavones and soy protein reflected that leptin can be reduced by soy isoflavones or soy protein. The aim of present study is to assess the effect of soy isoflavones plus soy protein on serum concentration of leptin among adults. To find randomized clinical trails (RCTs) assessing the effect of soy isoflavones containing soy protein on serum concentration of leptin in participants with age &#x2265;18 years old, databases including PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, Cochrane and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched up to March 2021. We calculated the effect size by the mean change from baseline of leptin concentrations and its standard deviation for intervention and comparison groups. DerSimonian and Laird random effects model was used to estimate the overall summary effect and the heterogeneity. Risk of bias was conducted by Cochrane Collaboration's tool. Study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (No. CRD42021228366). Eight articles with 421 participants and six articles with 336 participants were known to be eligible for systematic review and meta-analysis, respectively.

The present study aimed to investigate whether concentrated fish oil (FO) intervention could alleviate non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) via the regulation of the FGF21-adiponectin axis. In a randomized controlled trial, 61 patients with NAFLD, age 55.9 &#xb1; 15.6 y, were randomly divided into two groups: FO (3 g/d; n&#xa0;=&#xa0;30) and corn oil (CO; 3 g/d; n&#xa0;=&#xa0;31), which served as the control group.

In the animal study, the mice fed the high-fat diet demonstrated characteristics of NAFLD. The administration of FO significantly improved high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and inflammation compared with the high-fat control group. In addition, FO improved the sensitivity of FGF21, and stimulated the expression levels of adiponectin in the liver. The present study suggested that FO could potentially ameliorate NAFLD through mediating the FGF21-adiponectin axis.",

    "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the metabolic disturbances associated with liver cell inflammation. Nigella sativa (N.sativa) is a widely used medicinal plant known for its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and hepato-protective properties. This study aimed to assess the effect of supplementation of N. sativa oil on plasma levels of adiponectin, leptin, and blood pressure (BP) in patients diagnosed with NAFLD. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted on 44 NAFLD patients. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;22/group); the experimental group received 1000&#xa0;mg of N. sativa oil per day, while the control group received a placebo for eight weeks. The primary outcome measures were serum levels of adiponectin, leptin, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure measured at the baseline and the end of the intervention. After eight weeks of supplementation with N. sativa oil, no statistically significant differences were found in serum levels of adiponectin (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.40), leptin (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.89), systolic BP (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.13), and diastolic BP (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.09) between the two groups. Furthermore, after supplementation with N. sativa, no significant changes were observed in leptin (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.07), adiponectin (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.13), systolic BP (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.82), and diastolic BP (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.38) within the two groups. These results indicate that administration of N. sativa oil 1000&#xa0;mg/day for 8 weeks has no favorable effect on cardiometabolic measures in NAFLD patients. Further studies with higher dosage over a longer period are needed to investigate whether this effect is dose- and time-dependent.",

We used random-effects models to estimate weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Fourteen studies were included (N = 468 participants; mean age: 14 years). In general, PE increased adiponectin (WMD: 0.91&#xa0;&#xb5;g/mL; 95% CI, 0.27 to 1.55, p = 0.005), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (WMD: 1.01&#xa0;mg/dL; 95% CI, 0.33 to 1.69, p = 0.004), and VO2max (WMD: 2.52&#xa0;mL.kg.min; 95% CI, 1.41 to 3.62, p = 0.00,001). The levels of c-reactive protein (WMD: -0.37&#xa0;mg/L; 95% CI, -0.57 to -0.17, p = 0.0003), insulin (WMD: -4.61&#xa0;&#x3bc;IU/ml; 95% CI, -5.46 to -3.76, p = 0.00,001), fasting glucose (WMD: -5.11&#xa0;mg/dL; 95% CI, -7.88 to -2.34, p = 0.0003), and insulin resistance index (WMD: -1.44; 95% CI, -1.92 to -0.96, p = 0.00,001), decreased significantly. Our study showed that PE may increase the level of adiponectin, HDL-C, and VO2max in children.",

    "abstract": "Recently, omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants co-supplementation was considered as alternative treatment in the management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This trial evaluated effects of Camelina sativa oil (CSO) as a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants on anthropometric indices, lipid profile, liver enzymes, and adiponectin in NAFLD patients. This triple-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial was conducted on 46 NAFLD patients who were randomly assigned to either a CSO supplement or placebo for 12 weeks. Both groups received a loss weight diet. Levels of liver enzymes, adiponectin, lipid profile, atherogenic index, and anthropometric indices were assessed for all patients at baseline and post-intervention. CSO caused significant differences in weight, BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, triglyceride, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), TC/HDL-c, LDL-c/HDL-c, atherogenic index, alanine aminotransferase, and adiponectin concentrations in the CSO group compared with the placebo group (P &lt; 0.046 for all). No significant differences were found in hip circumference, neck circumference, HDL-c, and other liver enzymes in the CSO group compared with the placebo group (P = 0.790, P = 0.091, P = 0.149, P &lt; 0.159 for liver enzymes, respectively). This study showed that CSO supplementation for 12 weeks causes significant changes in all of anthropometric indices (except hip circumference and neck circumference), ALT, lipid profile (except HDL-c), atherogenic index, and adiponectin in NAFLD patients.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence has suggested an association of adiponectin gene polymorphisms rs1501299, rs2241766, rs266729 and rs3774261 with risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This correlation has been extensively meta-analyzed for the first two polymorphisms, but not the second two. The PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases were searched for relevant literature. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. A total of 10 case-control studies on rs266729 (2,619 cases and 1,962 controls) and 3 case-control studies on rs3774261 (562 cases and 793 controls) were included. Meta-analysis showed that rs266729 was associated with significantly higher NAFLD risk based on the following five models: allelic, OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.34-2.21, P &lt; 0.001; recessive, OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.86-2.95, P &lt; 0.001; dominant, OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.34-2.53, P &lt; 0.001; homozygous, OR 2.69, 95% CI 1.84-3.92, P &lt; 0.001; and heterozygous, OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.28-2.32, P &lt; 0.001. This association between rs266729 and NAFLD risk remained significant for all five models among studies with Asian, Chinese and Caucasian samples. The rs2241766 polymorphism was associated with significantly higher NAFLD risk according to the recessive model (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.15-3.04, P = 0.01). Polymorphisms rs266729 and rs3774261 in the adiponectin gene may be risk factors for NAFLD. These findings may pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies, but they should be verified in large, well-designed studies.",

    "title": "Comparison of Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors Between 2 Subclinical Atherosclerosis Measures in Healthy Postmenopausal Women: Carotid Artery Wall Thickness and Echogenicity: Carotid Artery Wall Thickness and Echogenicity.",
    "abstract": "Although carotid artery intima media thickness (CIMT) is a widely used determinant of subclinical atherosclerosis, gray-scale median of the intima-media complex (IM-GSM) of the common carotid artery is a relatively novel measure of echogenicity reflecting composition of the arterial wall. It is important to compare cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor correlates across CIMT and IM-GSM to determine whether these measures reflect distinct aspects of atherosclerosis. Baseline information from a completed randomized clinical trial of 643 healthy postmenopausal women without clinically apparent CVD was included in this cross-sectional study. The women were on average&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;SD 61&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;7&#x2009;years old, and predominantly non-Hispanic White. CIMT and IM-GSM were measured by high-resolution B-mode ultrasonogram in the far wall of the right common carotid artery. CVD risk factors including age, race, body mass index (BMI), smoking, weekly hours of physical activity, systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), lipids, glucose, and inflammatory markers were measured at baseline. Linear regression models were used to assess associations of CVD risk factors with CIMT and IM-GSM. Multivariable models included groups of risk factors added one at a time with and withoutbasic demographic factors (age, race, BMI, physical activity) with model R<sup>2</sup> values compared between CIMT and IM-GSM. In multivariable analysis, age, Black race, BMI, SBP, and DBP were associated with CIMT (all P&#xa0;&lt;&#x2009;.05), whereas age, Hispanic race, BMI, SBP, physical activity, LDL-cholesterol, and leptin were correlates of IM-GSM (all P&#xa0;&lt;&#x2009;.05). Adjusted for age, race, BMI, and physical activity, the R<sup>2</sup> value for SBP was greater for CIMT association, whereas R<sup>2</sup> values for lipids, glucose, inflammatory markers, and adipokines were greater for IM-GSM associations. CIMT and IM-GSM assess different attributes of subclinical atherosclerosis. Integrating both measures may provide improved assessment of atherosclerosis in asymptomatic individuals.",

    "title": "Effect of Paleolithic-based low-carbohydrate vs. moderate-carbohydrate diets with portion-control and calorie-counting on CTRP6, asprosin and metabolic markers in adults with metabolic syndrome: A randomized clinical trial.",
    "abstract": "Several recent studies have been undertaken into carbohydrate-restricted diets. it has not been clearly demonstrated whether diets with different proportions of energy from carbohydrate exert distinct effects on metabolism and inflammation or not. The current randomized clinical trial (RCT) has been conducted to further elucidate the effects of severe and mild carbohydrate restriction on inflammation and cardiometabolic status in adults with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Eighty adults with metabolic syndrome were randomized to one of the four carbohydrate restricted diets: Paleolithic-based low-carbohydrate diet with calorie-counting method (PLCD-CC) (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;20), Paleolithic-based low-carbohydrate diet with portion-control method (PLCD-PC) (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;20), moderate-carbohydrate diet with calorie-counting method (MCD-CC) (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;20) and moderate-carbohydrate diet with portion-control method (MCD-PC) (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;20) for 10 weeks. PLCD is defined as a diet consisting of 25-30% of energy from carbohydrate, 30% of energy from protein and 40-45% of energy from fat and encourages consumption of fruits, vegetables and lean meat. MCD is characterized as 40-45% carbohydrate, 30% protein and 30-35% fat. Body weight and composition, adipokines such as Asprosin, chemerin, leptin, hepatokines namely CTRP-6, FGF-21 and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors were tested at baseline and at the end of 10 weeks. A total of 69 participants aged 42.95 (9.27) with metabolic syndrome completed the trial. At the end of current 10-week dietary intervention trial, significant reduction in weight, waist circumference, body fat, visceral fat and waist-hip ratio (WHR) was observed in all four intervention arms (P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001). Also, the observed differences among groups did not reach statistical significance (P&#xa0;&gt;&#xa0;0.05). Moreover, we found significant reduction in CTRP6 and leptin in all intervention groups (P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001). Reduction of Asprosin level was also marginally significant between intervention groups (P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05). All four intervention groups were found to improve cardiometabolic markers such as FBS, TG, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol compared to baseline. However, despite clinically significant difference, the within- and between-group changes were not statistically significant at the end of trial. The current RCT in Iranian adults with metabolic syndrome revealed that both moderate and Paleolithic-based low carbohydrate diets with both delivery approaches have comparable beneficial effects in terms of body weight and composition, cardiometabolic factors and metabolism-related adipokines and hepatokines.

    "abstract": "The role of dairy foods and calcium/vitamin D supplements in cardiometabolic diseases is unknown. The objective of this secondary analysis is to investigate cardiometabolic risk factors changes after a 6-month weight-loss intervention in overweight/obese postmenopausal women divided in three groups: Ca+vitamin D supplements (S); low-fat dairy foods (D; 4&#x2212;5 servings/day); or control/placebo pills (C), as complements to hypocaloric diets. The original study focused on bone/body composition. This analysis included blood pressure (BP), and serum triglycerides, lipids (including apoproteins Apo1 and ApoB), adipokines, and C-reactive protein in n = 97 participants who finished with complete data points. Systolic BP decreased 5.1%, 4.8%, and 1.8% in S, D, and C groups, respectively (p &lt; 0.05 for S and D vs. baseline and vs. C at 6 months). Reduction in triglycerides and ratio of total cholesterol (TC)/high-density lipoproteins cholesterol (HDL-C) was the highest in S, while the reduction in TC and LDL-C was the highest in D group (all p &lt; 0.05). Leptin and ApoB significantly decreased and adiponectin and ApoA1 increased in all groups. In conclusion, although the C group&#x2019;s participants experienced an improvement in some of the cardiometabolic indices with weight loss, those in the S and D groups showed significantly better results in most of the outcomes, indicating the beneficial effects of low-fat dairy foods and/or Ca+vitamin D intake as complements to a hypocaloric diet.",

    "title": "Circulating chemerin levels in metabolic-associated fatty liver disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Chemerin is a brand-new adipokine that has been linked to both inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. Even though a rising number of studies have connected chemerin to metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), formerly referred to as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), this association has been controversial. A comprehensive literature search was undertaken up to February 1, 2022, in the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CNKI, WANFANG, and CBM library databases. Circulating chemerin levels were obtained and summarized using the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were conducted to examine the possibility of heterogeneity. A total of 17 studies involving 2580 participants (1584 MAFLD patients and 996 controls) evaluated circulating chemerin levels in patients with MAFLD. The present study showed that higher chemerin levels were found in patients with MAFLD (SMD: 1.32; 95% CI: 0.29, 2.35) and nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) (SMD: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.01, 1.50) compared to controls. However, circulating chemerin levels did not differ significantly in the following comparisons: nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) patients and controls (SMD: 0.75; 95% CI: -0.52, 2.03); NASH patients and NAFL patients (SMD: 0.16; 95% CI: -0.39, 0.70); moderate to severe steatosis and mild steatosis (SMD: 0.55; 95% CI: -0.59, 1.69); present liver fibrosis and absent liver fibrosis (SMD: 0.66; 95% CI: -0.42, 1.74); present lobular inflammation and absent lobular inflammation (SMD: 0.45; 95% CI: -0.53, 1.42); and present portal inflammation and absent portal inflammation (SMD: 1.92; 95% CI: -0.85, 4.69). Chemerin levels were considerably greater in patients with MAFLD than in controls, despite the fact that they were not significantly linked to different liver tissue lesions of MAFLD. In different subtypes of MAFLD, in comparison to healthy controls, the chemerin levels of NAFL patients were higher, whereas, there was no obvious difference in chemerin levels between NASH patients and controls. It is possible that chemerin will be used as a biomarker in the future to track the development and progression of MAFLD.",

    "title": "The Difference between Sacubitril Valsartan and Valsartan on Vascular Endothelial Function, APN, MMP-9, and BNP Levels in Patients with Hypertension and Chronic Heart Failure.",
    "abstract": "Sacubitril valsartan and valsartan are the first new drugs approved for angiotensin receptor neprilysin lysine inhibitors (ARNIs) in outpatients with chronic heart failure (CHF) and hypertension. Compared with enalapril, sacubitril valsartan and valsartan have been shown to reduce the mortality and morbidity of cardiovascular diseases. However, there is little actual evidence regarding the efficacy of ARNIs in hypertensive patients with CHF. From January 2019 to January 2021, 60 patients with hypertension and chronic heart failure were diagnosed and treated in our hospital. The patients were randomly divided into an observation group and a control group, with 30 cases in each group. The control group was given valsartan, the observation group was given sacubitril valsartan, and both groups were treated for six months. The endothelium-dependent vasodilation (EDD) function of the brachial artery and serum nitric oxide (NO), endothelin-1 (ET-1), carotid artery intima-media thickness, and glomerular filtration, excess rate (eGFR), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were compared between the two groups of patients before and after treatment. The serum adiponectin (APN), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels were compared before and after treatment. The total effective rate of treatment in the research group was higher than that in the control group (P &lt; 0.05). After treatment, the cardiac function indexes LVESD and LVEDD of the two groups of patients were lower than before treatment, and LVEF was higher than before treatment, and the improvement rate of the treatment group was better than that of the control group (P &lt; 0.05). After treatment, the serum APN of the two groups was higher than before treatment, the levels of MMP-9 and BNP were lower than before treatment, and the improvement rate of patients in the treatment group was better than that of patients in the control group (P &lt; 0.05). There was no statistically significant in the levels of EDD, NO, and ET-1 of the two groups of patients before treatment (P &lt; 0.05). After treatment, compared with the control group, the EDD function and NO level of the research group were significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05), and the level of ET-1 was significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in carotid artery intima-media thickness, glomerular filtration rate, and left ventricular ejection fraction before and after treatment in the two groups (P &lt; 0.05). In the treatment of hypertension and chronic heart failure, sacubitril valsartan can improve the clinical symptoms of patients to the greatest extent and can significantly improve the levels of LVEF, LVEDD, NT-proBNP, heart function, and other indicators. Sacubitril valsartan can increase serum APN levels, reduce MMP-9 and BNP levels, and have good clinical effects. Sacubitril valsartan has a protective effect on the vascular endothelial function of patients with hypertension and CHF. However, these results need to be confirmed in studies involving more subjects and require longer follow-up times.",

A systematic search was performed on PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang up to March 31, 2020. Meta-analysis was carried out by focusing on the associations between adipokines gene polymorphisms and knee OA with the allele model, dominant model, and recessive model. The present meta-analysis included 5 eligible studies for ADIPOQ rs1501299 with 1,021 cases and 1,097 controls, 3 eligible studies for ADIPOQ rs2241766 with 549 cases and 544 controls, 3 eligible studies for LEPR rs1137101 with 808 cases and 856 controls, 2 eligible studies for VISFATIN rs4730153 with 339 cases and 680 controls and 2 eligible studies for VISFATIN rs16872158 with 339 cases and 680 controls.

The pooled results showed that there were no significant differences between cases and controls in terms of ghrelin levels (SMD=-0.61, 95% CI -1.38 to 0.16; p=0.120; I<sup>2</sup>=96.9%, p&lt;0.001). The ghrelin concentrations in the CAD stratum were significantly lower than in controls, whereas they increased in other disease strata. New combined biomarkers demonstrated a significant decrease in the SMD of the ghrelin/total cholesterol (TC) ratio (-1.02; 95% CI -1.74 to -0.29, p=0.000; I<sup>2</sup>=94.5%). However, no significant differences were found in the SMD of the ghrelin/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, ghrelin/low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, and ghrelin/triglyceride (TG) ratio in cases with CVDs compared with the control group. Ghrelin was associated with CAD; therefore, it may be considered a biomarker for distinguishing between patients with and without CAD. Furthermore, the ghrelin/TC ratio could be proposed as a diagnostic marker for CVD.",

    "title": "Gender Differences in the Context of Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Metabolic Diseases.",
    "abstract": "The relationship between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and endocrine and metabolic disease is unequivocal. OSA, which is characterized by intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation, leads to and exacerbates obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes (T2D) as well as endocrine disturbances, such as hypothyroidism and Cushing syndrome, among others. However, this relationship is bidirectional with endocrine and metabolic diseases being considered major risk factors for the development of OSA. For example, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), one of the most common endocrine disorders in women of reproductive age, is significantly associated with OSA in adult patients. Several factors have been postulated to contribute to or be critical in the genesis of dysmetabolic states in OSA including the increase in sympathetic activation, the deregulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary axis, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), insulin resistance, alteration in adipokines levels, and inflammation of the adipose tissue. However, probably the alterations in the hypothalamus-pituitary axis and the altered secretion of hormones from the peripheral endocrine glands could play a major role in the gender differences in the link between OSA-dysmetabolism. In fact, normal sleep is also different between men and women due to the physiologic differences between genders, with sex hormones such as progesterone, androgens, and estrogens, being also connected with breathing pathologies. Moreover, it is very well known that OSA is more prevalent among men than women, however the prevalence in women increases after menopause. At the same time, the step-rise in obesity and its comorbidities goes along with mounting evidence of clinically important sex and gender differences. Metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, seen as a men's illness for decades, presently are more common in women than in men and obesity has a higher association with insulin-resistance-related risk factors in women than in men. In this way, in the present manuscript, we will review the major findings on the overall mechanisms that connect OSA and dysmetabolism giving special attention to the specific regulation of this relationship in each gender. We will also detail the gender-specific effects of hormone replacement therapies on metabolic control and sleep apnea.",

    "title": "Effect of Hedan Tablets on Body Weight and Insulin Resistance in Patients with Metabolic Syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Apart from their recognized lipid-lowering effect, Hedan tablets, a mixture of Chinese herbal medicines, have demonstrated a certain weight-loss effect in clinical practice. The aim of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to verify the effect of Hedan tablets on body weight (BW) and insulin resistance (IR) in patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS). A total of 62 eligible patients with MetS were divided into two groups: the treatment group (Hedan tablets at 4.38 g/day tid) and the control group (placebo treatment). Both groups attended follow-ups at 8, 16, and 24 weeks during the process. The parameters of the assessment include lipid level, BW, triglyceride (TG) to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) ratio (TG/HDLc), homeostasis model assessment for IR (HOMA-IR) index, and adiponectin. Patients in the treatment group showed a significant decrease in BW compared to those in the control group (-4.47 vs. 0.06 kg) after 8 weeks of treatment. A significant decrease in body mass index (BMI) was also observed in the treatment group after 16 weeks of treatment (-1.79 vs. -0.03 kg/m2). In the treatment group, 20 out of 31 (64.5%) patients lost 5-10% BW and 4 out of 31 (12.9%) patients lost over 10% BW after 24 weeks of treatment. Although there were no significant changes in the patients' HOMA-IR, the treatment group showed a significant reduction in TG/HDLc (-0.98 vs. -0.19) after 8 weeks of treatment and a significant increase in adiponectin (6.87 vs. -0.43) after 16 weeks of treatment. The Hedan tablets significantly improve BW, BMI, TG/HDLc, and adiponectin in patients with MetS. Thus, Hedan tablets may be used as an adjunct to existing MetS management methods.",

    "title": "Adipocytokines and disease progression in endometrial cancer: a systematic review.",
    "abstract": "The objective of the study was to document the effect of adipocytokines on endometrial cancer progression. A search of the databases CINAHL, Medline, PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, Embase and Google Scholar was performed for English language articles from January 2000 to December 2020 using the keywords: (Endometrial cancer) AND (progression OR metastasis) AND (adipocytokine OR adiponectin OR leptin OR visfatin OR IL-6 OR TNF-&#x3b1; OR adipokine OR cytokine). Forty-nine studies on adipocytokines have been included in this review. Adiponectin has been linked with anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effects on endometrial cancer cells and is associated with a better prognosis. Leptin, visfatin and resistin are linked to the stimulation of endometrial cancer growth, proliferation, invasion and metastasis and are associated with worse prognosis or with a higher grade/stage of endometrial cancer. IL-6, Il-11, IL-31, IL-33, TNF-&#x3b1;, TGF-&#x3b2;1, SDF-1 and CXCR are involved in endometrial cancer cell growth and metastasis or involved in epithelial mesenchymal transformation (EMT) or associated with advanced disease. Adipocytokines have been found to directly impact endometrial cancer cell proliferation, invasion and migration. These molecules and their signalling pathways may be used to determine prognosis and course of the disease and may also be exploited as potential targets for cancer treatment and prevention of progression.",

    "abstract": "<b/>Background: The modification of the gut microbiome has been proposed to alter immune response which is a key driver in low-grade inflammation as well as metabolic markers. This study was conducted to determine the effects of a low-calorie diet with and without nuts on some gut bacterial abundance, metabolic markers, and gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in stable coronary artery disease patients with overweight or obesity. Methods: Overweight or obese patients with stable coronary artery disease of both genders were randomly allocated to a nut-free calorie-restricted diet as 25% of energy deficit (CRD) or a CRD enriched with 39-60 g/d of mixed nuts (CRDEN) for 8 weeks (32 patients in CRD and 35 patients in CRDEN). Mixed nuts consisted of equal amounts of unsalted pistachios, almonds, and peanuts. Microbiota analysis was performed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction method on feces collected before and after the intervention, using primers targeting 16S ribosomal DNA of 4 different bacterial genera, including Bacteroides, Prevotella, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus. We examined the plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, adiponectin as well as expression of toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) and fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) in PBMCs. Results: A significant reduction in expression of CX3CR1 (p=0.04) and a tendency to lower expression of TLR4 in PBMCs (p=0.06) was observed in the CRDEN group at the end of the study compared to the CRD group. The abundance of fecal Prevotella also tended to increase in CRDEN compared to the CRD group (p=0.06). Plasma insulin and adiponectin had no significant changes. There was a positive correlation between fecal Prevotella abundance and plasma adiponectin at baseline (r=0.315, p=0.015) and the end of the study (r=0.380, p=0.003). Conclusion: Our results suggest that the inclusion of mixed tree nuts and peanuts in a low-calorie diet for 8 weeks led to a lower CX3CR expression in PBMCs in a cohort of overweight or obese patients with stable CAD. This finding provides another beneficial effect of diet supplemented with nuts on factors associated with inflammation.

    "abstract": "Adipokines, expressed by adipose tissue (AT), have been associated with metabolic disturbances and coronary artery disease (CAD). The impact of exercise training on the AT in patients suffering from both diabetes and CAD is unknown. To gain knowledge on changes in ATs' inflammatory profile in such a population, we investigated the effects of long-term exercise on selected adipokines and their associations with physical performance and glucometabolic variables. Adiponectin was selected based on its anti-atherogenic and anti-diabetic properties and visfatin and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) for their association with atherosclerosis and metabolic disorders. Not many studies have focused on the effects of long-term exercise training on adipokines in patients with concomitant T2DM and CAD. Patients with type 2 diabetes and CAD (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;137), 41-81&#xa0;years, 17.2% females, were randomized in a 1:1 manner to an exercise group, who underwent 1 year of 150&#xa0;min weekly combined strength and endurance exercise, or a control group. AT from the gluteal region and blood samples were obtained at baseline and after 12 months, along with a physical performance test, assessed by the VO2 peak. Circulating protein levels were measured by ELISA. RNA was extracted from AT and expression levels were relatively quantified by PCR. After 1 year, no significant difference in the change in the investigated markers between the intervention group and the control group was observed. Changes in circulating adiponectin and VO2 peak correlated in the total population (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.256, p =&#xa0;0.008). At baseline, circulating adiponectin and TNF correlated inversely with insulin and with C-peptide and VO2peak, respectively (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001, all). In this population with concomitant diabetes and CAD, ATs' inflammatory profile remained unchanged apparently after 1 year of exercise intervention. Changes in the VO2peak were nevertheless, related to changes in circulating adiponectin levels. http://www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT01232608.",

    "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders among women of reproductive age. Chemerin, a novel adipokine, is involved in inflammation, energy metabolism, adipogenesis, angiogenesis and insulin secretion in the adipose cells and ovary. This systematic review with meta-analysis aimed to compare serum and follicular fluid (FF) chemerin and ovarian chemerin mRNA expression among women with PCOS and non-PCOS. Electronic databases including Web of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, Cochrane and CINAHL were used for a comprehensive search through April 2021. Of the 174 articles initially identified, 22&#xa0;studies met the eligibility criteria. A random-effects model with a weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) was performed to compare the outcomes between groups. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed to detect the sources of heterogeneity. Women with PCOS compared to without PCOS showed significantly higher serum chemerin [WMD: 12.02&#xa0;pg/ml (95% CI: [10.92, 13.13]), p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.001], chemerin mRNA expression [WMD: 0.38% (95% CI [0.25, 0.52]), p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.001] and FF chemerin [(WMD): 41.7&#xa0;pg/ml (95% CI [17.89, 65.5]) p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.001]. Further, serum chemerin remained high in PCOS women even with subgroup analysis based on body mass index (BMI) or sample size (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.001). Serum chemerin was higher in women with PCOS and higher BMI [(WMD): 3.29&#xa0;pg/ml (95% CI: [2.73, 3.384]), p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.001]. The expression of chemerin mRNA was significantly higher in the PCOS group compared to the control group [WMD: 0.38% (95% CI [0.25, 0.52]), p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.001]. Serum and FF chemerin and mRNA expression were higher in the PCOS group compared to the controls. Further, serum chemerin was higher in PCOS women with higher BMI compared to lower BMI.

    "abstract": "Obesity and associated insulin resistance (Ins-R) have been identified as important risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma development. Elevated calories and protein consumption are also associated with Ins-R and glucose intolerance. We investigated the effect of a 24-month moderate calorie and protein restriction program on overweight or obese patients affected by Barrett's esophagus (BE), as no similar dietary approach has been attempted to date in this disease context. Anthropometric parameters, levels of serum analytes related to obesity and Ins-R, and the esophageal insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway were analyzed. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03813381. Insulin, C-peptide, IGF-1, IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3), adipokines, and esophageal expression of the main proteins involved in insulin/IGF-1 signal transduction were quantified using Luminex-XMAP<sup>&#xae;</sup> technology in 46 patients who followed the restriction program (IA) and in 54 controls (CA). Body mass index and waist circumference significantly decreased in 76.1% of IA and 35.2% of CA. IGF-1 levels were reduced in 71.7% of IA and 51.8% of CA. The simultaneous reduction of glycaemia, IGF-1, the IGF-1/IGFBP3 ratio, and the improvement in weight loss-dependent insulin sensitivity, were associated with the downregulation of the insulin/IGF-1 signal on BE tissue. The proposed intervention program was an effective approach to counteract obesity-associated cancer risk factors. The improvement in metabolic condition resulted in a downregulation of the ERK-mediated mitogenic signal in 43.5% of patients, probably affecting the molecular mechanism driving adenocarcinoma development in BE lesions.",

    "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease affecting the synovial joints and causing severe disability. Environmental and lifestyle factors, including diet, have been proposed to play a role in the onset and severity of RA. Dietary manipulation may help to manage the symptoms of RA by lowering inflammation and potentially decreasing pain. In 40 patients with long-standing RA with stable symptoms and treated with conventional (c-) and biological (b-) disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), the effect of a 3-month diet avoiding meat, gluten, and lactose (and all dairy products; privative diet) was evaluated in comparison with a control balanced diet including those foods. Both diets were designed to reduce weight since all patients were overweight or obese. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the diets, and RA was clinically assessed at Time 0 (T0), through the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), for pain, and the Disease Activity Score of 28 joints (DAS 28) for RA activity. Patients were also administered the Short Form Health survey (SF-36) and the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). At T0, a blood sample was collected for laboratory tests and adipokines measurements, and anthropometric measurements were compared. These evaluations were repeated at the end of the 3 months' dietary regimens. A significant decrease in VAS and the improvement of the overall state of physical and mental health, assessed through SF-36, was observed in patients assigned to the privative diet. Both dietary regimens resulted in the improvement of quality of life compared to baseline values; however, the change was significant only for the privative diet. With either diet, patients showed significant decreases in body weight and body mass index, with a reduction in waist and hips circumference and lower basal glucose and circulating leptin levels. A privative diet was also able to significantly reduce systolic (p = 0.003) and diastolic (p = 0.025) arterial pressure. The number of circulating leukocytes and neutrophils, and the level of hs-C-Reactive Protein also decreased after 3 months of the meat-, lactose-, and gluten-free diet. Our results suggest that a privative diet can result in a better control of inflammation in RA patients under stable optimized drug treatment.",

    "title": "Surgery for Obesity and Weight-Related Diseases Changes the Inflammatory Profile in Women with Severe Obesity: a Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.",
    "abstract": "Obesity increases significantly every year worldwide. Since 1980, the prevalence of individuals with obesity has practically doubled. Obesity plays an important role in the pathophysiology of diseases that arise from a complex interaction of nutritional, genetic, and metabolic factors, characterizing a chronic inflammatory state. This study aimed to verify the systemic inflammatory response through the analysis of IGF-1, IL-23, and resistin levels and the lipid profile in severely obese women undergoing surgery for obesity and weight-related diseases. This randomized controlled clinical trial includes female patients clinically diagnosed with severe obesity with an indication for bariatric surgery. In the initial evaluation, no significant difference was observed between the control (CG) and bariatric surgery (BSG) groups. The weight, BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, total non-HDL cholesterol, and glucose in BSG patients showed a significant change after surgery. Pre- and post-surgery levels of resistin, IGF-1, and IL-23 showed a significant difference in the BSG group, but only IL-23 was changed after 6&#xa0;months in the CG. The results of this study confirmed that weight loss induced by surgery for obesity and weight-related diseases improved the lipid profile and reduced the chronic inflammatory status in women with severe obesity.",

    "title": "Lack of cross-resistance between non-steroidal and steroidal aromatase inhibitors in breast cancer patients: the potential role of the adipokine leptin.",
    "abstract": "The aromatase inactivator exemestane may cause clinical disease stabilization following progression on non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors like letrozole in patients with metastatic breast cancer, indicating that additional therapeutic effects, not necessarily related to estrogen-suppression, may be involved in this well-known lack of cross-resistance. Postmenopausal women with ER positive, HER-2 negative, locally advanced breast cancer were enrolled in the NEOLETEXE-trial and randomized to sequential treatment starting with either letrozole (2.5&#xa0;mg o.d.) or exemestane (25&#xa0;mg o.d.) followed by the alternative aromatase inhibitor. Serum levels of 54 cytokines, including 12 adipokines were assessed using Luminex xMAP technology (multiple ELISA). Serum levels of leptin were significantly decreased during treatment with exemestane (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), regardless whether exemestane was given as first or second neoadjuvant therapy. In contrast, letrozole caused a non-significant increase in serum leptin levels in vivo. Our findings suggest an additional and direct effect of exemestane on CYP-19 (aromatase) synthesis presumably due to effects on the CYP19 promoter use that is not present during therapy with the non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor letrozole. Our findings provide new insights into the influence of clinically important aromatase inhibitors on cytokine levels in vivo that contribute to the understanding of the clinically observed lack of cross-resistance between non-steroidal and steroidal aromatase inhibitors in breast cancer patients.

    "abstract": "While renal biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosing lupus nephritis (LN), the prognostic and diagnostic role of non-invasive biomarkers for LN is currently debated. Available studies published in last 5 years (2015-2020) assessing the diagnostic and prognostic value of urinary and/or serological biomarkers in subjects with LN were analyzed in this systematic review. Eighty-five studies were included (comprehending 13,496 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], 8,872 LN, 487 pediatric LN, 3,977 SLE but no LN, 160 pediatric SLE but no LN and 7,679 controls). Most of the studies were cross-sectional (62; 73%), while 14 (17%) were prospective. In sixty studies (71%), the diagnosis of LN was biopsy-confirmed. Forty-four out of 85 (52%) investigated only serological biomarkers, 29 studies (34%) tested their population only with urinary biomarkers, and 12 (14%) investigated the presence of both. Outcome measures to assess the clinical utility of the analyzed biomarkers were heterogeneous, including up to 21 different activity scores, with the SLEDAI (in 60%) being the most used. Despite some heterogeneity, promising results have been shown for biomarkers such as urinary monocyte chemoattractant protein, urinary adiponectin, and urinary vascular cell adhesion protein 1. While serum and urine biomarkers have the potential to improve diagnostic and prognostic pathways in patients with LN, the vast heterogeneity across studies severely limits their applicability in current clinical practice. With the kidney biopsy still representing the gold standard, future efforts should focus on harmonizing study inclusion criteria and outcomes, particularly in clinical trials, in order to improve comparability and facilitate the implementations of available biomarkers into the daily practice.",

    "title": "Association of Adiponectin and Vitamin D With Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes and Survival in Stage III Colon Cancer.",
    "abstract": "Adipocyte-derived adiponectin may play a role in the host inflammatory response to cancer. We examined the association of plasma adiponectin with the density of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in colon cancers and with vitamin D, clinicopathological features, and patient survival. Plasma adiponectin and 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] were analyzed by radioimmunoassay in 600 patients with stage III colon cancer who received FOLFOX-based adjuvant chemotherapy (NCCTG N0147 [Alliance]). TIL densities were determined in histopathological sections. Associations with disease-free survival (DFS), time to recurrence, and overall survival were evaluated by multivariable Cox regression adjusting for potential confounders (ie, body mass index, race, TILs, and N stage). All statistical tests were 2-sided. We found a statistically significant reduction in adiponectin, but not 25(OH)D, levels in tumors with high vs low TIL densities (median&#x2009;=&#x2009;6845 vs 8984&#x2009;ng/mL; P = .04). A statistically significant reduction in adiponectin was also observed in obese (body mass index &gt;30&#x2009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) vs nonobese patients (median&#x2009;=&#x2009;6608 vs 12 351&#x2009;ng/mL; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001), in men vs women (median&#x2009;=&#x2009;8185 vs 11 567&#x2009;ng/mL; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001), in Blacks vs Whites or Asians (median&#x2009;=&#x2009;6412 vs 8847 vs 7858&#x2009;ng/mL; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.03), and in those with fewer lymph node metastases (N1 vs N2: median&#x2009;=&#x2009;7768 vs 9253&#x2009;ng/mL; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.01). Insufficiency of 25(OH)D (&lt;30&#x2009;ng/mL) was detected in 291 (48.5%) patients. In multivariable analyses, neither adiponectin nor 25(OH)D were associated with a statistically significant difference in DFS, overall survival , or time to recurrence in models adjusted for potential confounders. We found a statistically significant association of TILs with prognosis, yet no such interaction was observed for the association of adiponectin with TILs for DFS. Lower circulating adiponectin levels were associated with a statistically significant increase in TIL densities in colon cancers, indicating an enhanced antitumor immune response. In contrast to TILs, neither adiponectin nor 25(OH)D was independently prognostic.",

In this meta-analysis, the associations of polymorphisms within paraoxonase 1 (PON1), leptin (LEP) and leptin receptor (LEPR) genes with susceptibility to breast cancer were comprehensively evaluated. A universal search in PubMed, Scopus, CNKI, SID, Web of Knowledge and Google Scholar was performed to identify relevant studies up to 01 May, 2021. The strength of the associations was estimated by Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). A total of 39 case-control studies including 7 studies with 2005 cases and 2748 controls were on PON1 rs662, 6 studies with 2,031 cases and 1,973 controls on PON1 rs854560, 12 studies with 3,444 cases and 3,583 controls on LEP rs7799039, and 14 studies with 5,330 cases and 6,188 controls on LEPR rs1137101 were selected. Pooled data showed that PON1 rs662 and rs854560 polymorphisms were associated with risk of breast cancer in overall population, but not LEP rs7799039 and LEPR rs1137101. Our pooled data revealed that the PON1 rs662 and rs854560 polymorphisms were significantly associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in the overall population. However, LEP rs7799039 and LEPR rs1137101 polymorphisms were not associated.",

    "abstract": "The relationships between the rs266729, rs1501299, and rs2241766 polymorphisms in adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) and circulating levels of adiponectin and lipids remain to be clarified. Databases including PubMed and Embase were searched for eligible studies. The random-effects model was used, and standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated to estimate the differences in circulating levels of adiponectin and lipids between the subjects with different genotypes. A total of 12 810, 17 319, and 21 361 subjects were identified in the analyses for the rs266729, rs1501299, and rs2241766 polymorphisms, respectively. G allele carriers of the rs266729 polymorphism had lower levels of adiponectin (SMD=-0.28, 95% CI=-0.43 to-0.12) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (SMD=-0.10, 95% CI=-0.17 to-0.02) than CC homozygotes; T allele carriers of the rs1501299 polymorphism had higher levels of adiponectin (SMD=0.21, 95% CI=0.05 to 0.36) and HDL-C (SMD=0.09, 95% CI=0.04 to 0.15) and lower levels of triglycerides (SMD=-0.06, 95% CI=-0.12 to-0.01) than GG homozygotes; G allele carriers of the rs2241766 polymorphism had lower levels of adiponectin (SMD=-0.18, 95% CI=-0.31 to-0.05) and HDL-C (SMD=-0.12, 95% CI=-0.20 to-0.04) than TT homozygotes. This meta-analysis suggests that the rs266729, rs1501299, and rs2241766 polymorphisms of ADIPOQ are significantly associated with circulating levels of adiponectin and lipids, which may partly explain the associations between these polymorphisms and coronary artery disease.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the effects of 12 weeks of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on selected circulating adipokines and other cardiovascular diseases risks factors in men with obesity. Thirty men with obesity (age: 24.96&#xb1;3.11 year, BMI: 30.92&#xb1;1.04&#x2009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were randomly assigned to HIIT and control groups. The HIIT group participated in a 12-week HIIT program (5&#xd7;2&#x2009;min interval bout at an intensity of 85-95% HRmax interspersed by 1&#x2009;min passive recovery, three times per week), while the control group maintained their usual lifestyles. Blood lipids, insulin resistance, and select serum adipokines were assessed before and after 12 weeks of the intervention period. HIIT improved body composition and lipid profiles (p&lt;0.05) and also decreased fasting insulin levels (p=0.001) and HOMA-IR (p=0.002) levels. Furthermore, HIIT increased levels of lipocalin-2 (p=0.002) while decreasing omentin-1 levels (p=0.001) in men with obesity. Changes in lcn2 and omentin-1 concentrations correlated with the changes in risk factors in the HIIT group (p&lt;0.05). The results indicate that 12 weeks of supervised HIIT significantly improves both circulating concentrations of lcn2 and omentin-1, two recently described adipokines, and risk markers of cardiovascular diseases in men with obesity. Further research is necessary to understand the molecular mechanisms involved with these changes.",

    "title": "Evaluation of the frequency of ADIPOQ c.45 T&gt;G and ADIPOQ c.276 G&gt;T polymorphisms in adiponectin coding gene in girls with anorexia nervosa.",
    "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a serious chronic psychosomatic disorder, the essence of which are attempts by the sufferer to obtain a slim silhouette by deliberate weight loss (restrictive diet, strenuous physical exercise, provoking vomiting). The aetiology of this disorder is multifactorial. Genetic factors that influence the predisposition to AN have been sought. A broad meta-analysis points to a strong genetic correlation between AN and insulin resistance. Adiponectin (ADIPO) increases insulin sensitivity. In our pilot study we demonstrated that the TT genotype in locus ADIPOQ c.276 G&gt;T of the ADIPO gene and a higher concentration of ADIPO in blood serum occurred significantly more frequently in 68 girls suffering from AN than in 38 healthy girls. The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of the occurrence of ADIPOQ c.45 T&gt;G and ADIPOQ c.276 G&gt;T in the ADIPO gene in a larger cohort of girls with AN and healthy girls, as well as an analysis of correlations between variants of the aforementioned polymorphisms and the levels of ADIPO in blood serum. The study covered 472 girls (age: 11-19 years): 308 with the restrictive form of AN (AN) and 164 healthy girls (C). The level of ADIPO in blood serum was determined by means of the ELISA method on a Bio-Vendor, LLC (Asheville, North Carolina, USA). The DNA isolation was carried out by means of Genomic Mini AX BLOOD (SPIN). The PCR reaction was carried out in a ThermoCycle T100 thermocycler. 80-150 ng of the studied DNA and relevant F and R starters were added to the reaction mixture. The reaction products were subjected to digestion by restriction enzymes and separated on agarose gels (RFLP). The distribution of genotypes in the polymorphic site ADP c.45 of the ADIPO gene and ADP c.276 was similar in both groups. In both groups the T allele was most frequent in locus ADIPOQ c.45 and the G allele in locus ADIPOQ c.276. In all the study subjects collectively (AN and C) a statistically significant negative correlation between the levels of ADIPO in blood serum on one hand and body weight (r = -0.46; p &lt; 0.0001) and BMI (r = -0.67; p &lt; 0.0001) on the other was demonstrated. Exclusively in the AN group a significant correlation between the level of ADIPO in blood and the distribution of TG, TT, and GG alleles in loci ADIPOQ c.45 and ADIPOQ c.276 was demonstrated (p = 0.0052 and p &lt; 0.0001, respectively). The genotype in loci ADIPOQ c.45 and ADIPOQ c.276 of the ADIPO gene seems to have no effect on the predisposition to AN. Girls suffering from AN with the TT genotype in loci ADIPOQ c.45 and ADIPOQ c. 276 may demonstrate higher insulin sensitivity because they have significantly higher levels of ADIPO than girls suffering from AN with other genotypes. This may be suggestive of their better adaptation to the state of malnutrition, and it has a potential effect on treatment results.",

    "abstract": "Resistin is an adipocytokine related to insulin resistance and inflammation. We investigated whether resistin is associated with disease activity and inflammation in disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD)-na&#xef;ve rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, whether it has predictive value for radiological disease progression, and whether tumour necrosis factor-&#x3b1; (TNF-&#x3b1;) is involved in these effects. Ninety-nine patients with early, DMARD-na&#xef;ve RA participated in the NEO-RACo study. Patients were treated for the first 4&#xa0;weeks with a combination of methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, and prednisolone (FIN-RACo treatment). Thereafter, they were randomized to receive either infliximab or placebo added to the combination for 6&#xa0;months. Patients were followed for 5&#xa0;years. Disease activity was evaluated using the Disease Activity Score based on 28-joint count-erythrocyte sedimentation rate, radiographs were scored with the modified Sharp-van der Heijde method, and plasma resistin concentrations were measured by immunoassay. Human THP-1 macrophages were used in the in vitro studies. A high resistin level at baseline was associated with active inflammatory disease and predicted more rapid radiological progression during 5 year follow-up. Adding infliximab to the DMARD combination delayed radiological progression and overcame the poor predictive value of resistin. Resistin increased TNF-&#x3b1; production in human macrophages, indicating a possible connection between resistin and TNF-&#x3b1;. The results suggest that high resistin concentration may be a useful marker to distinguish patients with an increased risk of erosive disease in early active RA, and that adding TNF-&#x3b1; antagonist to the traditional DMARD combination may delay radiological progression of the disease in these patients.

    "abstract": "Childhood cancer survivors (CCS) are at increased risk to develop metabolic syndrome (MetS), diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Common criteria underestimate adiposity and possibly underdiagnose MetS, particularly after abdominal radiotherapy. A systematic literature review and meta-analysis on the diagnostic and predictive value of nine newer MetS related biomarkers (adiponectin, leptin, uric acid, hsCRP, TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6, apolipoprotein B (apoB), and lipoprotein(a) [lp(a)]) in survivors and adult non-cancer survivors was performed by searching PubMed and Embase. Evidence was summarized with GRADE after risk of bias evaluation (QUADAS-2/QUIPS). Eligible studies on promising biomarkers were pooled. We identified 175 general population and five CCS studies. In the general population, valuable predictive biomarkers are uric acid, adiponectin, hsCRP and apoB (high level of evidence), and leptin (moderate level of evidence). Valuable diagnostic biomarkers are hsCRP, adiponectin, uric acid, and leptin (low, low, moderate, and high level of evidence, respectively). Meta-analysis showed OR for hyperuricemia of 2.94 (age-/sex-adjusted), OR per unit uric acid increase of 1.086 (unadjusted), and AUC for hsCRP of 0.71 (unadjusted). Uric acid, adiponectin, hsCRP, leptin, and apoB can be alternative biomarkers in the screening setting for MetS in survivors, to enhance early identification of those at high risk of subsequent complications.",

    "title": "Can improvements in sleep quality positively affect serum adiponectin-levels in patients with obstructive sleep apnea?",
    "abstract": "Assess if changes in sleep quality (Sleep Quality Index, SQI) based on cardiopulmonary coupling-analysis (CPC) impacts serum adiponectin-levels in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Secondary analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) data from the Heart Biomarker Evaluation in Apnea Treatment study (HeartBEAT), a multicenter, controlled trial in patients with CVD and moderate-severe sleep apnea, randomly assigned to intervention of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), Nocturnal Supplemental Oxygen (NSO) or Healthy Lifestyle and Sleep Hygiene Education (HLSE; control group). Participants with good-quality ECG-signal (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;241) were included. Improving CPC-sleep quality was associated with net average improvements in serum adiponectin-levels 2.69&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/ml (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.005) irrespective of therapy initiated. After controlling for confounders, a unit increase in SQI was associated with increase in serum adiponectin-levels 0.071&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/ml (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.012) and decrease in insulin-levels 0.197 &#x3bc;IU/ml (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0018). Similarly, a percentage point increase in sleep apnea indicator (SAI) was associated with decrease in serum adiponectin-levels of 0.071&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/ml (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.017) and increase in insulin-levels of 0.218 &#x3bc;IU/ml (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.020). A percentage point increase in CPC-sleep fragmentation (eLFCBB) had a predicted increase in glucose-levels 0.371&#xa0;mg/dl (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.009) and insulin-levels 0.284 &#x3bc;IU/ml (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.010). In patients receiving CPAP-therapy, a difference in serum adiponictin levels of 3.82&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/ml (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.025) is observed comparing patients in which SQI-improved to patients that SQI-declined during the study period. The difference is mostly due to a decrease in serum adiponectin levels in patients that decline in SQI (-3.20&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/ml). Improvements in sleep quality were associated with higher serum adiponectin-levels, and improved measures of glycemic metabolism which may have beneficial effects on metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular health.

    "abstract": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-&#x3b3; agonists decrease hepatic/visceral fat (VF) and improve necroinflammation despite subcutaneous (SC) fat weight-gain. Understanding the impact of changes in VF, VF-to-SC fat distribution (VF/SC) and adiponectin (ADPN) levels in relation to histological improvement after weight-loss or pioglitazone is relevant as novel PPAR-&#x3b3; agonists are being developed for treating non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Fifty-five patients with NASH received a -500&#xa0;kcal/d hypocaloric diet and were randomized (double-blind) to pioglitazone (45&#xa0;mg/d) or placebo for 6-months. Before and after treatment patients underwent a liver biopsy and measurement of hepatic/peripheral glucose fluxes, hepatic/adipose tissue-IR and, in 35 patients, hepatic and VF/SC-fat was measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy/imaging. Data were examined by multivariable statistical analyses combined with machine-learning techniques (partial least square discriminant analysis [PLS-DA]). Both pioglitazone (despite weight-gain) and placebo (if weight-loss) reduced steatosis but only pioglitazone ameliorated necroinflammation. Using machine-learning PLS-DA showed that the treatment differences induced by a PPAR-&#x3b3; agonist vs placebo on metabolic variables and liver histology could be best explained by the increase in ADPN and a decrease in VF/SC, and to a lesser degree, improvement in oral glucose tolerance test-glucose concentrations and ALT. Decrease in steatosis and disease activity score (ballooning plus lobular inflammation) kept a close relationship with an increase in ADPN (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;-.71 and r&#xa0;=&#xa0;-.44, P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.007, respectively) and reduction in VF/SC fat (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;.41 and r&#xa0;=&#xa0;.37, P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.03 respectively). Reduction in VF and improved VF/SC-distribution, combined with an increase in ADPN, mediate the histological benefits of PPAR-&#x3b3; action, highlighting the central role of fat metabolism and its distribution on steatohepatitis disease activity in patients with NASH.",

    "abstract": "Aims of the present study were to investigate a wide array of psychological symptoms through validated psychometric tests, before and after 5 weeks of deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (dTMS) in individuals with obesity, and to identify possible relationships with neuroendocrine parameters. Forty-five patients with obesity (33&#x2009;F, 12&#x2009;M; age 48.8&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;9.9&#x2009;years; body wt 97.6&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;14.2&#x2009;Kg; BMI 36.2&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.2) were randomized into two groups: 26 received high frequency (HF) dTMS and 19 Sham stimulation for 5 weeks. At baseline and after the 5-week treatment, all patients underwent the following psychometric evaluations: Food Cravings Questionnaire-Trait (FCQ-T) and its subscales, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11), State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-y1 and STAI-y2), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Hormonal and neuroendocrine markers were assessed at the first and last dTMS session. By adjusting for baseline variables and treatment arms, a significant decrease in body wt and BMI was found in HF group, both with univariate (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.019) and multivariate analyses (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.012). Impulsivity significantly decreased in HF group, both with univariate (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.031) and multivariate analyses (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.011). A positive association between the impulsivity score change and the leptin level variation (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.031) was found. The decrease of impulsivity together with the BMI reduction in individuals with obesity, treated with real stimulation, suggests that impulsivity may be a risk factor for obesity. Treatment with dTMS revealed to be effective in reducing both BMI and impulsivity by enhancing inhibitory capacity of Pre-Frontal Cortex (PFC), and modulating neuroendocrine system, especially leptin.",

    "abstract": "Obesity causes different diseases, eventually. In our study, the results of resistance exercises were examined on selected biochemical markers in Abha City, Saudi Arabia, which is at the height of 2,270 meters above sea level. A randomized controlled research was conducted with 60 participants equally divided into three groups, 20 subjects in each group: group 1 was composed of obese people who received resistance training exercise, group 2 was composed of the obese control group who did not receive resistance training exercise, and group 3 was composed of normal individuals who received resistance exercise training. The resistance exercises were done in the 6th and 12th weeks. Biochemical blood tests were done. Comparing to the control group, glucose decreased very little with insulin also showing little difference. It has been seen that TC, TG, and LDL reduced to a reasonable extent after resistance exercise, while HDL was increased (p &#x2264; 0.01). Plasma urea and creatinine showed no differences. Interleukin-6 and leptin decreased significantly (p &#x2264; 0.01), while there was a significant elevation in adiponectin and testosterone (p &#x2264; 0.01) once comparing group 1 with group 2 and group 3. We have seen that resistance exercise helps in reducing lipid profile which will result in a decrease of the cardiac and related risk factors when conducted in obese patients in high-altitude regions. Also, alterations of the levels of interleukin-6, leptin, adiponectin, and testosterone showed that resistance exercise is of benefit and favourable in obese persons in high-altitude regions, which can also pave the way for added development of drugs related to the above parameters.",

    "abstract": "Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors have shown excellent results in glucose control in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients, while also promoting weight loss. These mechanisms may be beneficial in the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Our study aims to investigate the effect of dapagliflozin on hepatic and visceral fat contents and related biochemical markers in T2DM with NAFLD patients. This is a double-blinded placebo-controlled randomized, single-center study. Non-insulin-dependent T2DM patients with NAFLD were prospectively enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either dapagliflozin (10&#xa0;mg/day) or placebo for 12&#xa0;weeks. The primary end-point was the changes in intrahepatic lipid contents, evaluated by the liver attenuation index. Of 40 patients enrolled, 38 patients completed the study (dapagliflozin group, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;18; placebo group, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;20). Baseline demographic and laboratory findings were similar in both groups. After 12&#xa0;weeks of treatment, dapagliflozin significantly decreased intrahepatic lipid contents demonstrated by an increase in liver attenuation index in comparison with the placebo treatment (5.8&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;5.1 vs 0.5&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;6.1 Hounsfield units, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.006). Significant reduction in bodyweight, bodyfat, visceral fat/subcutaneous fat ratio, hemoglobin A1c, and alanine aminotransferase were also observed in the dapagliflozin-treated group as compared with the placebo group (all P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05). There was no significant difference in adipokines including adiponectin, leptin, and tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1; changes between the dapagliflozin-treated group and the placebo group (all P&#xa0;=&#xa0;nonsignificant). Dapagliflozin treatment for 12&#xa0;weeks is associated with improvement in hepatic fat content, a decrease in visceral fat and bodyweight, enhanced glycemic control, and improved liver biochemistry among T2DM patients with NAFLD.",

    "title": "Sarcopenic obesity as a determinant of cardiovascular disease risk in older people: a systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Aging is associated with body composition changes that include a reduction of muscle mass or sarcopenia and an increase in visceral obesity. Thus, aging involves a muscle-fat imbalance with a shift toward more fat and less muscle. Therefore, sarcopenic obesity, defined as a combination of sarcopenia and obesity, is a global health phenomenon due to the increased aging of the population combined with the increased epidemic of obesity. Previous studies have shown inconsistent association between sarcopenic obesity and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). To systematically review the recent literature on the CVD risks associated with sarcopenic obesity and summarizes ways of diagnosis and prevention. A systematic review of studies that reported the association between sarcopenic obesity and CVD risk in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations. Risk factors of sarcopenic obesity included genetic factors, aging, malnutrition, sedentary lifestyle, hormonal deficiencies and other molecular changes. The muscle-fat imbalance with increasing age results in an increase in the pro-inflammatory adipokines secreted by adipocytes and a decline in the anti-inflammatory myokines secreted by myocytes. This imbalance promotes and perpetuates a chronic low-grade inflammatory state that is characteristic of sarcopenic obesity. After application of exclusion criteria, only 12 recent studies were included in this review. The recent studies have shown a consistent association between sarcopenic obesity and cardiovascular disease risk although most of the studies are of cross-sectional design that does not confirm a causal relationship. In addition, most of the population studied were of Asian origin which may limit the generalizability of the results. Non-pharmacological interventions by exercise training and adequate nutrition appear to be useful in maintenance of muscle strength and muscle mass in combination with a reduction of adiposity to promote healthy aging. Sarcopenic obesity appears to increase the risk of CVD in older people; however, future prospective studies of diverse population are still required. Although non-pharmacologic interventions are useful in reducing the risk of sarcopenic obesity, novel specific pharmacologic agents are lacking.",

Chemerin stimulates adipocytes maturation and differentiation, as well as acts as a chemoattractant, which stimulates innate and acquired immunity. This adipokine participates in the early stages of acute inflammation as well as its suppression by reacting with the CMKLR1 receptor. In various diseases associated with inflammatory processes, the level of chemerin in the serum increases. It is also considered a marker for benign and malignant tumors. Explanation of the pathomechanisms involving this adipokine is of a high importance and may contribute to the development of new possibilities in the treatment of many diseases.

    "abstract": "A better baseline renal function is associated with a better response to sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes. Low serum adiponectin is associated with visceral fat accumulation and hepatic steatosis. We investigated the relationship between baseline serum adiponectin and glycemic response to dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In a randomized, active-controlled, open-label trial, 57 patients with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD were randomized to either the dapagliflozin (5 mg/d) group or the control group. Both groups were treated for 24 weeks. Serum high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin was measured with an ELISA kit. Visceral fat area (VFA) was measured by dual bioelectrical impedance analysis. Hepatic steatosis was assessed by the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) measured by a transient elastography (FibroScan). Treatment with dapagliflozin significantly decreased HbA1c from 8.4%&#xb1;1.5% at baseline to 7.4%&#xb1;1.2% at 24 weeks. Both VFA and CAP decreased in the dapagliflozin group. Baseline serum HMW adiponectin was negatively correlated with changes in HbA1c from baseline to 24 weeks with dapagliflozin therapy. In the multivariate analysis, baseline HbA1c (&#x3b2;=-0.559, p=0.002) and serum HMW adiponectin (&#x3b2;=0.471, p=0.010) were independent determinants for the change (reduction) in HbA1c. In the dapagliflozin group, the change in HbA1c was positively correlated with the changes of CAP, but negatively correlated with the change in serum HMW adiponectin. In conclusion, a lower serum level of HMW adiponectin was associated with a better response to dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD.Trial registration numberUMIN000022155.",

    "abstract": "Although a large body of literature reported the beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids (omega-3 FAs) consumption on adipokines levels, but recent findings from clinical trials are not univocal. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of omega-3 FAs supplements on adipokines. We searched Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library from inception to August 2020 without any particular language limitations. Outcomes were summarized as standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) estimated from Hedge's g and random effects modeling. Fifty-two trials involving 4,568 participants were included. Omega-3 FAs intake was associated with a significant increase in plasma adiponectin levels (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;43; 3,434 participants; SMD: 0.21, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.37; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01; I<sup>2</sup>= 80.14%). This meta-analysis indicates that supplementing participants with omega-3 fatty acids more than 2000&#x2009;mg daily and more than 10&#x2009;weeks resulted in a significant and more favorable improvement in plasma adiponectin levels. However, omega-3 FAs intake had no significant effect on leptin levels (SMD: -0.02, 95% CI: -0.20, 0.17, I<sup>2</sup>= 54.13%). The evidence supports a beneficial effect of omega-3 FAs intake on serum adiponectin levels but does not appear to impact on leptin concentrations. Larger well-designed RCTs are still required to evaluate the effect of omega-3 FAs on leptin in specific diseases.",

    "abstract": "With increasing age, the immune system undergoes a remodeling process, affecting the shift of T cell subpopulations and the development of chronic low-grade inflammation. Clinically, this is characterized by increased susceptibility to infections or development of several diseases. Since lifestyle factors can play a significant role in reducing the hallmarks of immune aging and inflammation, we investigated the effect of a 6 week low-dose combined resistance and endurance training program. Forty participants (70.3 &#xb1; 5.0 years) were randomly assigned to either a training (TG) or control group (CG) and performed a controlled low-threshold and care-oriented 6-week-long combined resistance and endurance training program. Changes in anthropometrics as well as strength capacity were measured. In subgroups of TG and CG, T cells and their subpopulations (CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, na&#xef;ve, central, effector memory, T-EMRA) were analyzed by flow cytometry. The changes of various plasma cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and adipokines were analyzed by luminex assays. The exercise program was followed by an increase in strength capacities. Participants of TG showed an increase of the CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell ratio over time (p &lt; 0.05). Significant decreases in systemic levels of interleukin (IL-) 6, IL-8, IL-10 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (p &lt; 0.05) were observed for participants of TG over time. Even short-term and low-threshold training can reduce some of the hallmarks of immune aging in elderly and thus could be beneficial to stimulate immunity. The specific characteristics of the program make it easily accessible to older people, who may benefit in the longer term in terms of their immunocompetence.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a common disease of developing countries, including Pakistan. Obesity is a risk factor for many diseases which can be life threatening or making the person unable to perform daily routine work. In the current study, clinical trials were designed to evaluate the effects of medical intervention by comparing the effects of placebo control drug Plasicure with the herbal medicinal formulation Obesecure. The test drug formulation was designed on the basis of the screening study for Leptogenic drugs. To evaluate the safety of the test drug, the toxicity index and the safety profile of test formulation was assessed on animal models. The drug was found safe for further clinical study. Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials were conducted. The statistical analysis was carried out by the application of Two-Way Repeated Analysis of Variance test. The clinical findings of randomized controlled trial revealed that the test drug was Leptogenic and effective in weight reduction as compared to control drug Plasicure therapy as the p-value deduced was 0.001 in leptin level and 0.000 in case of BMI after the conduction of Two-Way Repeated Analysis of Variance test. Hence it is concluded that obscure therapy is more significant than control drug Plasicure therapy in the management and treatment of obesity.",

    "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the emerging cause of chronic liver disease globally and lack of approved therapies. Here, we investigated the feasibility of combinatorial effects of low molecular weight fucoidan and high stability fucoxanthin (LMF-HSFx) as a therapeutic approach against NAFLD. We evaluated the inhibitory effects of LMF-HSFx or placebo in 42 NAFLD patients for 24 weeks and related mechanism in high fat diet (HFD) mice model and HepaRG<sup>TM</sup> cell line. We found that LMF-HSFx reduces the relative values of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total cholesterol, triglyceride, fasting blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c in NAFLD patients. For lipid metabolism, LMF-HSFx reduces the scores of controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and increases adiponectin and leptin expression. Interestingly, it reduces liver fibrosis in NAFLD patients, either. The proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and interferon-&#x3b3; are reduced in LMF-HSFx group. In HFD mice, LMF-HSFx attenuates hepatic lipotoxicity and modulates adipogenesis. Additionally, LMF-HSFx modulates SIRI-PGC-1 pathway in HepaRG cells under palmitic acid-induced lipotoxicity environment. Here, we describe that LMF-HSFx ameliorated hepatic steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis and insulin resistance in NAFLD patients. LMF-HSFx may modulate leptin-adiponectin axis in adipocytes and hepatocytes, then regulate lipid and glycogen metabolism, decrease insulin resistance and is against NAFLD.",

    "abstract": "Improved understanding of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) pathogenesis is required to identify treatment targets. This systematic review summarized evidence from animal studies and clinical research examining the role of adipokines and perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) in AAA pathogenesis. Meta-analyses suggested that leptin (Standardized mean difference [SMD]: 0.50 [95% confidence interval (CI): -1.62, 2.61]) and adiponectin (SMD: -3.16 [95% CI: -7.59, 1.28]) upregulation did not significantly affect AAA severity within animal models. There were inconsistent findings and limited studies investigating the effect of resistin-like molecule-beta (RELM&#x3b2;) and PVAT in animal models of AAA. Clinical studies suggested that circulating leptin (SMD: 0.32 [95% CI: 0.19, 0.45]) and resistin (SMD: 0.63 [95% CI 0.50, 0.76]) concentrations and PVAT to abdominal adipose tissue ratio (SMD: 0.56 [95% CI 0.33, 0.79]) were significantly greater in people diagnosed with AAA compared to controls. Serum adiponectin levels were not associated with AAA diagnosis (SMD: -0.62 [95% CI -1.76, 0.52]). One, eight, and one animal studies and two, two, and four human studies had low, moderate, and high risk-of-bias respectively. These findings suggest that AAA is associated with higher circulating concentrations of leptin and resistin and greater amounts of PVAT than controls but whether this plays a role in aneurysm pathogenesis is unclear.",

In total, 79 articles were selected and the identified biomarkers were categorized according to EC (dys)function in CU. The most frequent and consistently reported upregulated biomarkers in CU skin were adhesion molecules, TF, and P-selectin. The most frequently reported upregulated and reliable biomarkers in sera of CU patients were F1+2 for coagulation cascade involvement, D-dimers for fibrinolysis, and MMP-9 for vascular permeability. Emerging biomarkers described in the selected articles were endostatin, heat shock proteins, cleaved high molecular weight kininogen, and adipokines. This systematic review contributes to the pool of growing evidence for vascular involvement in CU where EC dysfunction is present in different aspects of cell survival, maintenance of vascular structure, and coagulation/fibrinolysis balance.",

Weight loss, via the dynamic interplay of energy balance through exercise and/or caloric restriction, decreases risk of breast cancer recurrence. We investigated the effects of lifestyle modifications (exercise only, or combined caloric restriction and exercise) on adipokines, IL2, IL6, IL8, IL10, C-reactive protein (CRP), and TNF&#x3b1; biomarkers in breast cancer survivors. Searches were completed in June and July of 2019 to identify randomized controlled trials that met inclusion criteria. Weighted mean difference was calculated using random- or fixed-effects models based on the heterogeneity of the studies. 2501 records were identified, with 30 ultimately meeting inclusion criteria of the systematic review; 21 studies provided data suitable for meta-analysis. We observed leptin levels were significantly reduced in the exercise-only group compared with sedentary control [WMD -5.66; 95% confidence interval (CI), -11.0 to -0.33; P = 0.04]. Leptin may be a primary mediator of exercise-induced improvements in breast cancer recurrence. This is the first review and meta-analysis to examine combined exercise and caloric restriction programs in breast cancer survivors.

    "abstract": "Asprosin is a recently discovered protein released during fasting conditions mainly by adipocytes from white adipose tissue. As a glucogenic peptide, it stimulates the release of glucose from hepatic cells by binding to the OLFR734 receptor and leading to the activation of the G protein-cAMP-PKA pathway. As it crosses the blood-brain barrier, it also acts as an orexigenic peptide that stimulates food intake through activation of AgRP neurons in the hypothalamus; thus, asprosin participates in maintaining the body's energy homeostasis. Moreover, studies have shown that asprosin levels are pathologically elevated in obesity and related diseases. However, the administration of anti-asprosin antibodies can both normalize its concentration and reduce food intake in obese mice, which makes it an interesting factor to combat obesity and related diseases. Current research also draws attention to the relationship between asprosin and fertility, especially in men. Asprosin improves age- and obesity-related decrease in fertility potential by improving sperm motility. It should also be mentioned that plasma asprosin levels can be differentially modulated by physical activity; intense anaerobic exercise increases asprosin level, while aerobic exercise decreases it. However, further research is necessary to confirm the exact mechanisms of asprosin activity and its potential as a therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare the effect of dynamic (DRT) and isometric (IRT) resistance training on glycemic homeostasis, lipid profile, and nitric oxide (NO) in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Patients were randomly distributed into 3 groups: control (n&#xa0;= 65), DRT (n&#xa0;= 65), and IRT (n&#xa0;= 67). Patients assessed before and after the intervention period were tested for fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, oral glucose tolerance test, insulin resistance, lipid profile, leptin, insulin, adiponectin, C-reactive protein, and NO . Patients underwent to strength and body composition assessments. Subjects allocated in both DRT and IRT groups took part in a 24-week resistance training program, 3 times per week. Each training session was approximately 1 hour before dialysis and consisted of 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions at low intensity. Total workload was higher in the DRT as compared with the IRT. This heightened workload related to better glycemic homeostasis in HD patients as measured by regulation of insulin, adiponectin, and leptin, while improveing triglycerides, free-fat mass, and muscle strength. Additionally, NO levels were increased in the DRT group. NO was significantly correlated with glucose intolerance (r&#xa0;= -0.42, p&#xa0;= 0.0155) and workload (r&#xa0;= 0.46, p&#xa0;= 0.0022). The IRT group only improved strength (p&#xa0;&lt; 0.05). Twenty-four weeks of DRT improved glycemic homeostasis, lipid profile, and NO in HD patients. Although IRT seems to play an important role in increasing strength, DRT might be a better choice to promote metabolic adjustments in HD patients. Clinical trial: http://www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/rg/RBR-3gpg5w. Novelty: DRT might be a better choice for metabolic improvements in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that obesity is associated with the severity of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We reviewed clinical studies to clarify the obesity relationship with COVID-19 severity, comorbidities, and discussing possible mechanisms. The electronic databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar, were searched and all studies conducted on COVID-19 and obesity were reviewed. All studies were independently screened by reviewers based on their titles and abstracts. Forty relevant articles were selected, and their full texts were reviewed. Obesity affects the respiratory and immune systems through various mechanisms. Cytokine and adipokine secretion from adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state in obese patients, predisposing them to thrombosis, incoordination of innate and adaptive immune responses, inadequate antibody response, and cytokine storm. Obese patients had a longer virus shedding. Obesity is associated with other comorbidities such as hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, and vitamin D deficiency. Hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and even mortality in obese patients were higher than normal-weight patients. Obesity could alter the direction of severe COVID-19 symptoms to younger individuals. Reduced physical activity, unhealthy eating habits and, more stress and fear experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic may result in more weight gain and obesity. Obesity should be considered as an independent risk factor for the severity of COVID-19. Paying more attention to preventing weight gain in obese patients with COVID-19 infection in early levels of disease is crucial during this pandemic.",

Four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) had a high risk of bias (RoB), 1 had some concerns, and 2 had a low RoB. Among the nonrandomized studies with comparators, 4 had a serious RoB and 2 had a moderate RoB. In the experimental animal studies with a moderate RoB, conflicting results for omentin serum concentration were found for high-fat and low-fat diets. A high-fat diet (HFD) was shown to reduce omentin gene expression in one animal study. In the observational studies, omentin serum concentration was reduced by Ramadan fasting and saturated fatty acid (SFA) intake, and an increase in omentin gene expression was observed with monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) intake. There was no association of dietary inflammatory index (DII), macronutrient intake, or total calorie intake with omentin plasma concentrations. In the human interventional studies, omentin plasma concentration increased with a long-term low-calorie, low-fat diet (LFD), and no change was seen with a HFD or a short-term low-calorie diet (LCD). Key Messages: It seems that a long-term diet with a lower fat content and a balanced distribution of fatty acids, i.e., a higher MUFA and lower SFA intake, may effectively increase omentin plasma concentration, possibly via improved insulin resistance and reduced inflammation, but more research is needed to confirm or refute this.",

    "title": "Regulation of Intestinal Inflammation by Dietary Fats.",
    "abstract": "With the epidemic of human obesity, dietary fats have increasingly become a focal point of biomedical research. Epidemiological studies indicate that high-fat diets (HFDs), especially those rich in long-chain saturated fatty acids (e.g., Western Diet, National Health Examination survey; NHANES 'What We Eat in America' report) have multi-organ pro-inflammatory effects. Experimental studies have confirmed some of these disease associations, and have begun to elaborate mechanisms of disease induction. However, many of the observed effects from epidemiological studies appear to be an over-simplification of the mechanistic complexity that depends on dynamic interactions between the host, the particular fatty acid, and the rather personalized genetics and variability of the gut microbiota. Of interest, experimental studies have shown that certain saturated fats (e.g., lauric and myristic fatty acid-rich coconut oil) could exert the opposite effect; that is, desirable anti-inflammatory and protective mechanisms promoting gut health by unanticipated pathways. Owing to the experimental advantages of laboratory animals for the study of mechanisms under well-controlled dietary settings, we focus this review on the current understanding of how dietary fatty acids impact intestinal biology. We center this discussion on studies from mice and rats, with validation in cell culture systems or human studies. We provide a scoping overview of the most studied diseases mechanisms associated with the induction or prevention of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in rodent models relevant to Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis after feeding either high-fat diet (HFD) or feed containing specific fatty acid or other target dietary molecule. Finally, we provide a general outlook on areas that have been largely or scarcely studied, and assess the effects of HFDs on acute and chronic forms of intestinal inflammation.",

    "abstract": "The study aimed to evaluate the effects of a 3-week &#x3c9;-3 PUFA supplementation on serum adipocytokines (i.e., adiponectin, leptin), neuregulin-4 (NRG4) and erythrocyte omega-3 (&#x3c9;-3) fatty acid content, as well as the blood antioxidant defense capacity in non-elite endurance runners. Twenty-four runners were randomized into two groups: the supplemented group, who received omega free fatty acids extract containing 142 mg of EPA, 267 mg of DHA, 12 mg of vitamin E and 5 &#xb5;g of vitamin D, each administrated at a dose of six capsules twice a day for three weeks, or the placebo group. Venous blood samples were withdrawn at the start and at the end of the study protocols to estimate serum biochemical variables. A significantly higher &#x3c9;-3 index and lower AA/EPA ratio was observed after &#x3c9;-3 PUFA compared to pre-supplementation levels (p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively). An increase in baseline adiponectin and NRG4 levels, as well as a decrease of leptin concentration and lipid profile improvement, were observed in subjects after a &#x3c9;-3 PUFA diet. The increased &#x3c9;-3 index had a significant effect on TNF&#x3b1; levels and a serum marker of antioxidant defense. The &#x3c9;-3 PUFA extract with added vitamin E and D supplementation may have a positive effect on the function of the adipocyte tissue, as well as the ability to prevent cardiovascular complications in athletes.",

    "title": "Proteomic and Mechanistic Analysis of Spironolactone in Patients at Risk for HF.",
    "abstract": "This study sought to further understand the mechanisms underlying effect of spironolactone and assessed its impact on multiple plasma protein biomarkers and their respective underlying biologic pathways. In addition to their beneficial effects in established heart failure (HF), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists may act upstream on mechanisms, preventing incident HF. In people at risk for developing HF, the HOMAGE (Heart OMics in AGEing) trial showed that spironolactone treatment could provide antifibrotic and antiremodeling effects, potentially slowing the progression to HF. Baseline, 1-month, and 9-month (or last visit) plasma samples of HOMAGE participants were measured for protein biomarkers (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;276) by using Olink Proseek-Multiplex cardiovascular and inflammation panels (Olink, Uppsala, Sweden). The effect of spironolactone on biomarkers was assessed by analysis of covariance and explored by knowledge-based network analysis. A total of 527 participants were enrolled; 265 were randomized to spironolactone (25 to 50&#xa0;mg/day) and 262 to standard care (control). The median (interquartile range) age was 73 years (69 to 79 years), and 26% were female. Spironolactone reduced biomarkers of collagen metabolism (e.g., COL1A1, MMP-2); brain natriuretic peptide; and biomarkers related to metabolic processes (e.g., PAPPA), inflammation, and thrombosis (e.g., IL17A, VEGF, and urokinase). Spironolactone increased biomarkers that reflect the blockade of the mineralocorticoid receptor (e.g., renin) and increased the levels of adipokines involved in the anti-inflammatory response (e.g., RARRES2) and biomarkers of hemostasis maintenance (e.g., tPA, UPAR), myelosuppressive activity (e.g., CCL16), insulin suppression (e.g., RETN), and inflammatory regulation (e.g., IL-12B). Proteomic analyses suggest that spironolactone exerts pleiotropic effects including reduction in fibrosis, inflammation, thrombosis, congestion, and vascular function improvement, all of which may mediate cardiovascular protective effects, potentially slowing progression toward heart failure.

Insulin-resistant adults without rheumatic disease were randomized to 13&#x2009;weeks of HCQ (400&#x2009;mg/day) versus placebo (double-blinded). Primary outcomes were changes in skeletal muscle and liver insulin sensitivity assessed by hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp and stable-isotope tracer methods. Secondary outcomes included insulin clearance, inflammation biomarkers and adipokines. Compared with placebo, HCQ significantly improved skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity by 26% (p = .019) and enhanced systemic glucose clearance (p = .025). By contrast, HCQ had no effect on hepatic insulin sensitivity. HCQ did not affect insulin clearance but decreased circulating IL-6 (p = .01) and increased adiponectin (p = .045). There were no effects on leptin, RBP-4, FGF-21 or C-reactive protein. HCQ selectively enhances insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal in skeletal muscle, without affecting hepatic insulin sensitivity or insulin clearance. These findings offer a mechanistic explanation for the antidiabetic properties of HCQ and suggest that this medication might be useful in conditions linked to insulin resistance such as type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "The exact mechanism of Parkinson's disease (PD) is not fully understood yet, but it is suggested that inflammation is one of its contributing factors. Among several inflammatory factors, adipokines, especially leptin may have a great role in this mechanism; since it is not only causing inflammation, but it can also play other roles in the body that may contribute to the symptoms described for PD. Regarding the contradictions in the association of serum leptin levels with Parkinson's disease, a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to have a more accurate estimation of this relationship. Published literature was obtained by searching PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Ovid, ProQuest and Google Scholar. Random-effect model analysis was used to calculate pooled standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity was tested with the heterogeneity statistic Q and quantified using I<sup>2</sup>. Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the study quality. Six studies including a total number of 198 PD patients and 182 controls were finally included in the meta-analysis. Serum leptin levels in PD patients were non-significantly lower than those in control group (SMD&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.40&#xa0;ng/ml, 95% CI -2.33-1.53). Subgroup analyses revealed that serum leptin levels of PD patients and controls in either females or males didn't show any significant difference. This meta-analysis revealed that leptin level doesn't show any significant difference between PD patients and healthy controls, even when taking the participants' gender into consideration.",

For the DIRECT-PLUS 18-month randomized clinical trial, we assigned 294 participants with abdominal obesity/dyslipidaemia into healthy dietary guidelines (HDG), MED and green-MED weight-loss diet groups, all accompanied by physical activity. Both isocaloric MED groups consumed 28&#x2009;g/day walnuts (+440&#x2009;mg/day polyphenols provided). The green-MED group further consumed green tea (3-4 cups/day) and Mankai (a Wolffia globosa aquatic plant strain; 100&#x2009;g/day frozen cubes) green shake (+1240&#x2009;mg/day total polyphenols provided). IHF% 18-month changes were quantified continuously by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Participants (age=51&#x2009;years; 88% men; body mass index=31.3&#x2009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>; median IHF%=6.6%; mean=10.2%; 62% with NAFLD) had 89.8% 18-month retention-rate, and 78% had eligible follow-up MRS. Overall, NAFLD prevalence declined to: 54.8% (HDG), 47.9% (MED) and 31.5% (green-MED), p=0.012 between groups. Despite similar moderate weight-loss in both MED groups, green-MED group achieved almost double IHF% loss (-38.9% proportionally), as compared with MED (-19.6% proportionally; p=0.035 weight loss adjusted) and HDG (-12.2% proportionally; p&lt;0.001). After 18&#x2009;months, both MED groups had significantly higher total plasma polyphenol levels versus HDG, with higher detection of Naringenin and 2-5-dihydroxybenzoic-acid in green-MED. Greater IHF% loss was independently associated with increased Mankai and walnuts intake, decreased red/processed meat consumption, improved serum folate and adipokines/lipids biomarkers, changes in microbiome composition (beta-diversity) and specific bacteria (p&lt;0.05 for all). The new suggested strategy of green-Mediterranean diet, amplified with green plant-based proteins/polyphenols as Mankai, green tea, and walnuts, and restricted in red/processed meat can double IHF loss than other healthy nutritional strategies and reduce NAFLD in half.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of associations of leptin and adiponectin with overall and aggressive prostate cancer. Bibliographic databases were systematically searched up to 1st April 2017. Log Odds Ratios (ORs) per 2.5 unit increase in adiponectin or leptin levels were derived and pooled. All analyses were stratified by study type (cross-sectional/prospective). 746 papers were retrieved, 34 eligible studies identified, 31 of these could be included in the meta-analysis.

    "abstract": "Short-term exercise training programs that consist of moderate intensity endurance training or high intensity interval training have become popular choices for healthy lifestyle modifications, with as little as two weeks of training being shown to improve cardiorespiratory fitness and whole-body glucose metabolism. An emerging concept in exercise biology is that exercise stimulates the release of cytokines and other factors into the blood that contribute to the beneficial effects of exercise on metabolism, but whether these factors behave similarly in response to moderate and high intensity short term training is not known. Here, we determined the effects of two short-term exercise training programs on the concentrations of select secreted cytokines and Klotho, a protein involved in anti-aging. Healthy, sedentary men (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;22) were randomized to moderate intensity training (MIT) or sprint intensity training (SIT) treatment groups. SIT consisted of 6 sessions over 2 weeks of 6&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;30&#x2009;s all out cycle ergometer sprints with 4&#x2009;min of recovery between sprints. MIT consisted of 6 sessions over 2 weeks of cycle ergometer exercise at 60% VO2peak, gradually increasing in duration from 40 to 60&#x2009;min. Blood was taken before the intervention and 48&#x2009;h after the last training session, and glucose uptake was measured using [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET/CT scanning. Cytokines were measured by multiplex and Klotho concentrations by ELISA. Both training protocols similarly increased VO2peak and decreased fat percentage and visceral fat (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). MIT and SIT training programs both reduced the concentrations of IL-6, Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) and Leptin. Interestingly, MIT, but not SIT increased monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) concentrations, an exercise-induced cytokine, as well as Klotho concentrations. Short-term exercise training at markedly different intensities similarly improves cardiovascular fitness but results in intensity-specific changes in cytokine responses to exercise.",

This study was to evaluate the effects of synbiotic supplementation along with a low-calorie diet on some recurrence-related factors such as adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#x3b1;), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) among obese and overweight BCSs. We performed a randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial among 76 overweight or obese postmenopausal women with a history of hormone-receptor-positive BC. Participants were randomly divided into 2 groups to intake either 10<sup>9</sup> CFU/day synbiotic supplement or placebo (n = 38 each group) for 8 weeks. All participants were given a low-calorie diet program. The primary outcome was serum concentration of adiponectin which was measured at baseline and after 8 weeks.

    "abstract": "The adipokine zinc-alpha2-glycoprotein (ZAG), a multidisciplinary protein, is involved in lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis and energy balance. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that the expression of ZAG is mainly downregulated in obesity and obesity-related conditions. In the present study, we assessed the association of ZAG with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the related risk factors including obesity, metabolic factors and inflammatory parameters, with emphasis on potential mechanisms underlying these associations. PRISMA guidelines were followed in this review. Systematic searches were performed using the PubMed/Medline, ScienceDirect, Scopus, EMBASE, ProQuest and Google Scholar databases, up to August 2020 for all relevant published papers. Out of 362 records screened, 34 articles were included in the final analysis. According to the studies reviewed here, ZAG appears to exert a protective effect against NAFLD by enhancing mRNA expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x3b1; (PPAR&#x3b1;) and PPAR&#x3b3;, promoting mRNA expression levels of the lipolysis-related genes, reducing mRNA expression levels of the lipogenesis-related genes, increasing hepatic fatty acid oxidation, ameliorating hepatic steatosis, promoting the activity of brown adipose tissue and the expression of thermogenesis-related genes, modulating energy balance and glucose homeostasis, and elevating plasma levels of healthy adipokines such as adiponectin. ZAG can also be involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses by attenuation of the expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic mediators. According to the studies reviewed here, ZAG is suggested to be a promising therapeutic target for NAFLD. However, the favourable effects of ZAG need to be confirmed in prospective cohort studies.",

    "title": "Serum and peritoneal fluid leptin levels in endometriosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "The role of leptin in the development of endometriosis has been investigated previously. However, researches on the change of leptin levels in endometriosis remains controversial. So, we aimed to clarify changes of leptin levels in patients with endometriosis and their association with the progression of endometriosis. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and The Cochrane Library to identify relevant studies published before May 25, 2020. The detected levels of leptin in patients with endometriosis versus controls were evaluated in this meta-analysis. Eighteen studies met our inclusion criteria, five studies detected serum, nine detected peritoneal fluid and another four detected both serum and peritoneal fluid leptin levels. The overall results showed that peritoneal fluid leptin levels in patients with endometriosis was significantly higher than that in the control group, but the serum and corrected peritoneal fluid leptin levels were comparable in both groups. Subgroup analysis failed to eliminate the high degree of heterogeneity included in the studies and showed that peritoneal fluid leptin levels were significantly elevated in both early and advanced endometriosis. In conclusion, peritoneal fluid rather than serum leptin levels was elevated in patients with endometriosis, which did not seem to be related to the severity of endometriosis, but was related to body mass index.",

    "abstract": "Leptin is a hormone produced by adipocytes that regulates food intake and metabolism. Leptin-related gene-deficient mice, such as db/db and ob/ob mice, are widely used to study diabetes and its related diseases. However, broad effects of leptin appear to cause variability in behavioral test results. We performed a meta-analysis of major behavioral tests in db/db and ob/ob mice. These mice exhibited significant impairments in the Morris water maze, forced swim, novel object recognition, Y-maze, tail suspension, and light-dark box tests, whereas the elevated plus maze and open field tests did not reveal significant changes. We also performed correlation and regression analyses between the animals' performances and the experimental protocols and conditions. The memory-related tests were characterized by the correlations of their results with animal age, while the performances in the elevated plus-maze and forced swim tests were affected by the width of the devices used. In conclusion, db/db and ob/ob mice mainly exhibit memory deficits and depression-like behavior, although experimenters should be aware of animal age and device size in conducting experiments.",

    "abstract": "Physical inactivity and the onset of menopause increase the risk of cardiovascular disease amongst postmenopausal women. We aim to investigate the effect of resistance training (RT) on plasma levels of selected cytokines, adipokines, myokines, and sex hormones in postmenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms. This was a sub-study of a randomised controlled trial investigating the effects of RT on vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women. Women were randomised to join a 15-week RT program (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;26) or remain sedentary as control (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;29). Venous blood samples were taken at week-0 and week-15 for all participants. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and multiple bead assays were used to measure cytokines, adipokines, myokines, and sex hormones in plasma. Plasma measurements of 16 of 33 analytes were within detectable limits. After adjusting for good compliance in the RT group (58% of RT participants), after 15&#xa0;weeks, significantly lower plasma levels of adiponectin (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), lipocalin-2 (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01) and resistin (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04) were found. Comparing control and RT women, using change-over-time values, significant increases in median testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin levels were seen in RT women. RT intervention lowers the levels of adipokines, particularly adiponectin, in postmenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms. These results were secondary outcomes of a clinical trial, and further investigations in a larger cohort are essential with the additional control of diet control and body composition analyses. Nevertheless, our study shows RT may be a beneficial intervention in reducing inflammation amongst postmenopausal women.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is characterised by metabolic abnormalities that increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Altered levels of circulating ghrelin, several adipokines and inflammatory markers secreted from adipose tissue, such as leptin, adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor alpha, are observed in overweight and obese individuals. We assessed the effect of supplementation with low doses of a cod protein hydrolysate (CPH) on fasting and postprandial levels of acylated ghrelin, as well as fasting levels of adiponectin, leptin and inflammatory markers in subjects with MetS. A multicentre, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial with a parallel group design was conducted. Subjects received a daily supplement of CPH (4 g protein, n = 15) or placebo (0 g protein, n = 15). We observed no effect on fasting or postprandial levels of acylated ghrelin, fasting levels of adiponectin (p = 0.089) or leptin (p = 0.967) after supplementation with CPH, compared to placebo. Overall, our study showed that 8 weeks supplementation with a low dose of CPH in subjects with MetS had no effect on satiety hormones or most of the inflammatory markers, but the levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were statistically significantly different in the CPH-group compared to placebo group. The robustness and clinical relevance of these findings should be explored in future studies with a larger sample size.",

    "abstract": "Fasting and energy-restricted diets have been evaluated in several studies as a means of improving cardiometabolic biomarkers related to body fat loss. However, further investigation is required to understand potential alterations of leptin and adiponectin concentrations. Thus, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to derive a more precise estimate of the influence of fasting and energy-restricted diets on leptin and adiponectin levels in humans, as well as to detect potential sources of heterogeneity in the available literature. A comprehensive systematic search was performed in Web of Science, PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane, SCOPUS and Embase from inception until June 2019. All clinical trials investigating the effects of fasting and energy-restricted diets on leptin and adiponectin in adults were included. Twelve studies containing 17 arms and a total of 495 individuals (intervention&#xa0;=&#xa0;249, control&#xa0;=&#xa0;246) reported changes in serum leptin concentrations, and 10 studies containing 12 arms with a total of 438 individuals (intervention&#xa0;=&#xa0;222, control&#xa0;=&#xa0;216) reported changes in serum adiponectin concentrations. The combined effect sizes suggested a significant effect of fasting and energy-restricted diets on leptin concentrations (WMD:&#xa0;-3.690&#xa0;ng/ml, 95% CI:&#xa0;-5.190,&#xa0;-2.190, p&#xa0;&#x2264;&#xa0;0.001; I<sup>2</sup>&#xa0;=&#xa0;84.9%). However, no significant effect of fasting and energy-restricted diets on adiponectin concentrations was found (WMD:&#xa0;-159.520&#xa0;ng/ml, 95% CI:&#xa0;-689.491, 370.451, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.555; I<sup>2</sup>&#xa0;=&#xa0;74.2%). Stratified analyses showed that energy-restricted regimens significantly increased adiponectin (WMD: 554.129&#xa0;ng/ml, 95% CI: 150.295, 957.964; I<sup>2</sup>&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0%). In addition, subsequent subgroup analyses revealed that energy restriction, to &#x2264;50% normal required daily energy intake, resulted in significantly reduced concentrations of leptin (WMD:&#xa0;-4.199&#xa0;ng/ml, 95% CI:&#xa0;-7.279,&#xa0;-1.118; I<sup>2</sup>&#xa0;=&#xa0;83.9%) and significantly increased concentrations of adiponectin (WMD: 524.04&#xa0;ng/ml, 95% CI: 115.618, 932.469: I<sup>2</sup>&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0%). Fasting and energy-restricted diets elicit significant reductions in serum leptin concentrations. Increases in adiponectin may also be observed when energy intake is &#x2264;50% of normal requirements, although limited data preclude definitive conclusions on this point.",

    "abstract": "Adolescents with scoliosis consistently demonstrate lower body weight, lean muscle mass, and bone mineral density than healthy adolescent counterparts. Recent studies have focused on understanding how leptin and ghrelin signaling may play a role in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). In our current study, we aim to evaluate the serum levels of leptin, soluble leptin receptor (sOB-R), and ghrelin in AIS patients through systematic review and meta-analysis. We conducted our systematic review by searching the keywords in online databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Elsevier, Springer, and Web of Science from the time of database inception to January 2020. Inclusion criteria were studies that measure leptin, soluble leptin receptor (sOB-R), and ghrelin levels in AIS patients. Selection of studies, assessment of study quality, and data extraction were performed by two reviewers independently. Then, data was analyzed to calculate the mean difference and 95% confidence interval (CI). Seven studies concerning leptin/sOB-R and three studies concerning ghrelin were qualified for meta-analysis (one study concerning both leptin and ghrelin). Serum leptin of patients with AIS were significantly lower when compared with healthy controls, with the weighted mean difference (WMD) of - 0.95 (95% CI - 1.43 to - 0.48, p &lt; 0.0001) after reducing the heterogeneity using six studies for meta-analysis, while sOB-R and ghrelin level was significantly higher in AIS group when compared with control group, with the WMD of 2.64 (95% CI 1.60 to 3.67, p &lt; 0.001) and 1.42 (95% CI 0.48 to 2.35, p = 0.003), respectively. Our current meta-analysis showed that serum level of leptin in AIS patients was significantly lower when compared with control subjects, while serum sOB-R and ghrelin levels were significantly higher in AIS patients. More clinical studies are still required to further validate the predictive value of leptin or ghrelin for the curve progression for AIS patients.",

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to determine whether the polymorphisms at rs2241766 and rs1501299 on the ADIPOQ gene were related to the susceptibility of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Eight databases, PubMed, GWAS, Embase, Lochrane, Ebsco, CNKI (Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure), VIP (Viper Database) and ChinaInfo were searched, and a meta-analysis of susceptibility was conducted between SNP45, SNP276 polymorphisms and T2DM. Furthermore, HWE test was conducted to assess the genetic balance of the study, evaluate the quality of Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale (NOS), and establishing allelic, dominant, recessive, heterozygous, and homozygous gene models. This meta-analysis included 53 articles, encompassing 9285 cases with rs2241766 and 14156 controls and 7747 cases with rs1501299 and 10607 controls. For the rs2241766 locus, a significant correlation was found in the three models by the subgroup analysis. Western Asians: dominant gene model (TT + TG vs. GG, P = 0.01); heterozygous gene model (TG vs. GG, P = 0.02); homozygous gene model (TT vs. GG, P = 0.01). South Asians: dominant gene model (TT + TG vs. GG, P = 0.004); heterozygous gene model (TG vs. GG, P = 0.009); homozygous gene model (TT vs. GG, P = 0.005). However, no statistically significant correlation was established among the five genetic models for rs1501299 locus. The findings of the present study indicated that the T allele of rs2241766 polymorphism is the susceptibility locus of T2DM in the West Asian population, but has a protective effect in the South Asian population, albeit further studies are needed in other populations. Also, no association was found between the ADIPOQ rs1501299 polymorphism and T2DM.",

Alterations in gut microbiota (GM) diversity and composition have also been proposed to play a pivotal role in obesity pathogenesis. This trial aimed to assess the effects of probiotic supplementation on the anthropometric indices, eating behavior, and hormone levels of obese women with FA. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted among obese women with FA.

    "abstract": "Obesity is one of major risk factors increasing chronic diseases including type II diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and hypertension. The effects of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the major active compound in green tea, on reduced obesity and improved metabolic profiles are still controversial. Furthermore, the effects of EGCG on human adipocyte lipolysis and browning of white adipocytes have not been elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the effects of EGCG on obesity, lipolysis, and browning of human white adipocytes. The results showed that, when compared to the baseline values, EGCG significantly decreased fasting plasma triglyceride levels (P &lt;&#x2009;0.05), systolic blood pressure (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05), diastolic blood pressure (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05), and serum kisspeptin levels (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) after 8 weeks of supplement. On the other hand, supplement of EGCG in obese human subjects for 4 or 8&#x2009;weeks did not decrease body weight, body mass index, waist and hip circumferences, nor total body fat mass or percentage when compared to their baseline values. The study in human adipocytes showed that EGCG did not increase the glycerol release when compared to vehicle, suggesting that it had no lipolytic effect. Furthermore, treatment of EGCG did not enhance uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) mRNA expression in human white adipocytes when compared with treatment of pioglitazone, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x3b3; (PPAR-&#x3b3;) agonist, suggesting that EGCG did not augment the browning effect of PPAR-&#x3b3; on white adipocytes. This study revealed that EGCG reduced 2 metabolic risk factors which are triglyceride and blood pressure in the human experiment. We also showed a novel evidence that EGCG decreased kisspeptin levels. However, EGCG had no effects on obesity reduction in humans, lipolysis, nor browning of human white adipocytes.",

Forty-eight obese adolescent boys (age&#x2009; = 15.4&#x2009; &#xb1; &#x2009;1.1&#x2009;years and body mass index&#x2009; = &#x2009;32.2&#x2009; &#xb1; &#x2009;2.4&#x2009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were randomly assigned into one of four groups: JRE + white chocolate (JW; n = 13), JRE + dark chocolate supplementation (JD; n = 13), dark chocolate supplementation (DS; n = 12), or control (C; n = 12). Participants in JW and JD groups performed JRE for three times per week for six weeks. Participants in the DS and JD groups consumed 30 g of dark chocolate containing 83% of cocoa. Body composition, pro-inflammatory cytokines ((hs-CRP, TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-6), adipokines (leptin, resistin, RBP-4, chemerin, MCP-1), and anti-inflammatory adipokines (irisin, adiponectin)) were evaluated prior to and after the intervention trials. All three intervention trials significantly (p &lt; 0.05) decreased body mass, waist-hip ratio, fat mass, hs-CRP, TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-6, leptin, resistin, RBP-4, and MCP-1, and increased irisin and adiponectin concentrations. The improvements in these parameters were greater in the JD group, and additionally, chemerin concentrations decreased only in the JD group. JD enhanced adiponectin concentrations and decreased IL-6 concentrations compared to C. Moreover, JD significantly reduced chemerin concentrations, an effect not observed in any of the other interventions. We demonstrated that dark chocolate supplementation potentiated JRE-induced decreases in body mass, WHR, FM, hs-CRP, TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-6, leptin, resistin, RBP-4, and MCP-1, chemerin as well as increases irisin and adiponectin concentrations in obese adolescent boys. Therefore, JRE combined with dark chocolate supplementation could be a beneficial in reducing obesity-induced inflammation in adolescent boys.",

    "abstract": "There are conflicting reports regarding circulating leptin and its relationship between pregnancy outcomes in infertile women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between serum or follicular fluid (FF) leptin concentrations reported for infertile women and their IVF outcome. A systematic search was undertaken in available databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library and Embase) to find studies published up to Aug 2020 and the standardized mean difference with 95 % confidence interval was taken from 14 eligible studies. Both graphical (funnel plots) and test methods (Egger's regression test and the Begg) assessed the presence of publication bias. Subgroup analysis was used to investigate the source of heterogeneity. Pooled effect sizes based on the eligible papers indicated that of there is no statistically significant correlation between leptin levels in follicular fluid and serum on the day of ovum pick-up (OPU) and day of HCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin) administration in pregnant and non-pregnant women who underwent IVF/ICSI cycles. However, combination of leptin in serum and/or FF with other parameters may be a useful marker to predict IVF outcome.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the most identified cause of death in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). This study aimed to evaluate the effect of adding Vildagliptin versus Glimepiride to ongoing Metformin on the biomarkers of inflammation, thrombosis, and atherosclerosis in T2DM patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD). This study included 80 patients with uncontrolled T2DM and symptomatic CAD who were randomized to add either Vildagliptin 50&#xa0;mg/day group I or Glimepiride 4&#xa0;mg/day group II to ongoing Metformin therapy (1000&#xa0;mg/day). Blood samples were collected at baseline and 3&#xa0;months after intervention for biochemical analysis of HbA1c %, IL-1&#x3b2;, adiponectin, hsCRP and lipid profile. Additionally atherogenic index (AI) and coronary risk index (CRI) were determined. Three months after intervention and as compared to group II (Glimepiride/Metformin), group 1 (Vildagliptin/Metformin) showed significantly lower BMI (28.73&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;3.48 versus 30.55&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;3.15; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.02), HbA1c (6.05&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.72 versus 7.06&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.89; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.0001), hsCRP (0.96&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.20 versus 1.72&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.38; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.0001), IL-1&#x3b2; (34.95&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;10.01 versus 45.13&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;10.26; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.0001), TC (136&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;23.45 versus 169&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;35.72; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.0001), TG (116&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;29.10 versus 146&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;56.58; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.005), and CRI (2.47&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.90 versus 3.65&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.19; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.0001) which was associated with significantly higher adiponectin and HDL-C (4.42&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.29 versus 2.52&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.86; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.0001 and 61&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;23.04 versus 48&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;12.92; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.003 respectively). In patients with T2DM and symptomatic CAD, the addition of Vildagliptin to ongoing metformin showed better glycemic control, lower inflammatory markers (IL-1&#x3b2; and hsCRP), higher protective markers (adiponectin and HDL-C) and improved lipid profile compared to Glimepiride/metformin therapy.",

    "title": "Circulating levels of CTRP3 in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared to controls: A systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Growing evidence suggests that adipokines may be therapeutic targets for cardiometabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). C1q TNF Related Protein 3 (CTRP3) is a newly discovered adipokine which shares properties with adiponectin. The literature about the association between circulating levels of CTRP3 and T2DM has been conflicting. The present study reassessed the data on circulating CTRP3 levels in T2DM patients compared to controls through a systematic review and meta-analysis. A literature search was performed in Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of science to identify studies that measured circulating CTRP3 levels in T2DM patients and controls. The search identified 124 studies of which 59 were screened for title and abstract and 13 were subsequently screened at the full text stage and 12 studies included into the meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses, depending on the presence of T2DM complications, matching for BMI, age, and cut off value of fasting blood sugar and HOMA-IR, were performed. The results show that circulating CTRP3 levels are negatively associated with T2DM status (SMD: -0.837; 95% CI: (-1.656 to -0.017); p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.045). No publication bias was identified using the Begg's rank correlation and Egger's linear regression tests (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;1 and P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.44, respectively). Meta-regression demonstrated significant association between CRTP3 levels with BMI (slope: 0.11; 95% CI: 0.04-0.19; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.001) and sex (slope: -0.07; 95% CI: -0.12 to -0.01; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.008). The present systematic review and meta-analysis evidences a negative association between circulating level of CTRP3 and T2DM status. BMI and sex may modify this association.",

    "abstract": "Elevation of the plasma concentration of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a rapid-acting inhibitor of fibrinolysis, is associated with development of vascular thrombotic diseases, including coronary artery disease and stroke. We investigated the effects of empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, on the plasma concentration of PAI-1 and fibrinolytic activity in patients with type 2 diabetes. In a randomized, active-controlled, open-label trial, 51 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly allocated at a 2:1 ratio to receive empagliflozin (10&#x202f;mg/day, n&#x202f;=&#x202f;31) or standard therapy (n&#x202f;=&#x202f;18) for 12&#x202f;weeks. We measured the plasma concentrations of PAI-1 and plasmin-&#x3b1;2-antiplasmin complex (PAP) as indicators of fibrinolytic activity. Serum leptin and high-molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin were also measured. In 49 patients who completed the trial, baseline plasma PAI-1 showed a positive correlation with body weight, visceral fat area (VFA), &#x3b3;-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT), leptin, and the platelet count, while it showed a negative correlation with HDL cholesterol and PAP. Body weight and VFA decreased significantly in the empagliflozin group, but not in the control group. The serum level of GGT showed a significant decrease at 12&#x202f;weeks in the empagliflozin group, while it was unchanged in the control group. Serum HMW adiponectin increased significantly in the empagliflozin group. Plasma PAI-1 decreased significantly by 25% in the empagliflozin group, but not in the control group. In the empagliflozin group, the change of plasma PAI-1 was positively correlated with the changes of body weight and leptin, but was negatively correlated with the change of PAP. Empagliflozin reduced the plasma PAI-1 concentration through its synergistic actions of a glucose-lowering effect, VFA loss, and restoring the adipokine balance.

    "title": "[The potential role of organic and conventional yoghurt consumption in the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease].",
    "abstract": "Health is an important motivation for the consumption of both organic and functional foods. Organic food contains fewer pesticide residues and statistically more selected health-related compounds such as polyphenols in plant products and polyunsaturated fatty acids in milk and meat products. Recent studies suggest that the gut-liver axis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, so probiotics could be a therapeutic tool. Comparing the health effects of yoghurt from organic origin with so-called conventional yoghurt is difficult, because there is no biomarker that would signal the difference with good specificity and sensitivity. The aim of this study was to investigate numerous biomarkers to evaluate the difference between yoghurt from conventional and organic origin and their health effects in NAFLD. We performed a prospective, cohort study consisting of 37 (age = 51.73 &#xb1; 11.82, male = 21, female = 16) patients with NAFLD at the 2nd Department of Internal Medicine of the Semmelweis University, Budapest. Diagnosis of NAFLD was based on ultrasonography and the exclusion of other etiololgy. The patients were examined also with shear wave elastography to evaluate the hepatic fibrosis stage. We divided the patients randomly into two groups. The patients consumed individually daily 300 grams of yoghurt from organic (n = 21) or conventional (n = 16) origin for 8 weeks. We collected 37 routine laboratory data, measured 4 cytokines, 3 markers of the redox-homeostasis and 14 body composition values before, after, and 12 weeks after the yoghurt consumption. We found a mild elevation of vitamin D and a minimal reduction of LDL after the yoghurt consumption, but in the other 35 routine laboratory data there was no statistical difference. Adiponectin and leptin levels were elevated after the yoghurt consumption in the conventional group. In contrast, we found significant decrease of adiponectin levels in the organic group after the treatment. Only the adiponectin tendency was different in the two groups. The induced free radical content was also statistically lower after the yoghurt consumption. In the body composition measurements, there were no significant differences. These data suggest that adiponectin could be a possible biomarker to evaluate the effectiveness of probiotic treatment in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Our work can serve as a basis for future studies investigating relationships between organic yoghurt consumption and health outcomes. Orv Hetil. 2020; 161(35): 1466-1474.",

    "abstract": "&#x39d;on-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is estimated to be the most common cause of end-stage liver disease in the next years. Vitamin E has shown beneficial effects as a possible scavenger of oxidative stress products, which play a major role in pathogenesis of the disease. The purpose of the present meta-analysis is to investigate the effects of vitamin E supplementation in biochemical and histological parameters in adult patients with NAFLD. Literature search was performed in major electronic databases (MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and Embase) up to June 2020 for randomized clinical trials, which examined vitamin E versus placebo treatment in adults with NAFLD. Changes in liver enzymes were considered as primary outcomes while changes in histological, biochemical, and metabolic parameters as secondary. Quality of evidence was assessed through risk of bias according to the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Eight studies were included in qualitative analysis and seven in quantitative analysis. Vitamin E reduced the values of liver enzymes compared with placebo (-7.37&#xa0;IU/L, 95% confidence interval: -10.11 to -4.64 for alanine aminotransferase, and -5.71&#xa0;IU/L, 95% confidence interval: -9.49 to -1.93 for aspartate aminotransferase). Additionally, vitamin E improved statistically significantly liver pathology in every individual histological parameter as well as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, and serum leptin values. Vitamin E can improve biochemical and histological characteristics of NAFLD patients, especially of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis patients. The results indicate that vitamin E could be a promising choice and be considered as a treatment option in patients with NAFLD.",

The present study aimed to evaluate changes in oxidative stress, adipokines, liver enzyme, and body composition following treatment with chromium picolinate (CrPic) among patients with NAFLD. The current randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted on 46 NAFLD patients with the age range of 20-65&#x2009;years. Patients were randomly classified into two groups, receiving either 400&#x2009;&#xb5;g CrPic tablets in two divided doses of 200&#x2009;&#xb5;g (23 patients) or placebo (23 patients) daily for 12&#x2009;weeks. The participants' body composition and biochemical parameters were evaluated at the baseline and after 12&#x2009;weeks. Serum levels of liver enzymes reduced significantly only in the CrPic group (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05 for all), but not between the groups after the intervention. Besides, there were significant differences between the study groups regarding body weight and body fat mass, total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, leptin, and adiponectin post-intervention (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.017, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.032, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.023, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.012, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003, and P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.042, respectively). However, glutathione peroxidase and resistin levels did not differ significantly between groups (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.127 and P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.688, respectively). This study showed that consuming 400&#x2009;&#xb5;g/day of CrPic for 12&#x2009;weeks in patients with NAFLD causes a significant change in leptin, adiponectin, oxidative stress (expect glutathione peroxidase), and body weight, compared to baseline. Nevertheless, it does not affect liver enzymes. Therefore, the CrPic supplementation may improve adipokines, some anthropometric indices, and oxidative stress in patients with NAFLD.",

    "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is defined as a reproductive endocrine disease that results in a low-grade inflammatory and pro-oxidant state. Dietary factors, including n-3 fatty acids, may have a key role in improving metabolic disorders in PCOS patients. The present study aimed to investigate the influence of n-3 fatty acid supplementation on inflammatory and oxidative stress (OS) markers in patients with PCOS. A systematic literature search of Medline/PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus and Lilacs, until November 2019, was conducted. Randomised clinical trials that reported inflammatory and OS markers as endpoints in women with PCOS receiving n-3 fatty acid supplementation were included. The pooled estimates of the weighted mean differences (WMD) and the standard mean differences (SMD) were calculated. Random effects models were adopted to measure the pooled outcomes. Among the 323 studies retrieved, ten fulfilled the inclusion criteria for a meta-analysis. We founded a significant decrease in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (SMD -0&#xb7;29 (95 % CI -0&#xb7;56, -0&#xb7;02) mg/l) and an increase in adiponectin (WMD 1&#xb7;42 (95 % CI 1&#xb7;09, 1&#xb7;76) ng/ml) concentrations in the intervention group when compared with the placebo group. No statistically significant results were found in the meta-analysis for visfatin, nitric oxide, GSH or malondialdehyde levels or total antioxidant capacity. The data suggest that supplementation of n-3 fatty acids could reduce the inflammatory state in women with PCOS, through a decrease in hs-CRP and an increase in adiponectin levels.",

Saffron and its constituents are reported to have several properties such as anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic effects. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial with two parallel groups including 76 eligible men and female patients with NAFLD aged 18-65, recruited from Hazrat Rasul Akram Hospital in Tehran, Iran. NAFLD was defined by a Gastroenterologist based on the American Gastrointestinal and Liver Association standards. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups receiving daily supplementation of either one tablet of 100&#x2009;mg saffron (n =&#x2009;38) or one placebo (n =&#x2009;38) for 12&#x2009;weeks.

    "abstract": "Leptin is associated with cardiovascular risk. Some studies analyzed the potential association between leptin and arterial stiffness, an independent cardiovascular risk factor. However, the studies that investigated this association provided inconsistent and heterogeneous results. We performed a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the available studies on the relationship between leptin and arterial stiffness to achieve definitive conclusions. A systematic search of the on-line databases available (up to December 2019) was conducted including the observational studies that reported the evaluation of the relationship between non-invasively assessed arterial stiffness (expressed by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity) and leptin. For each study, the effect size was standardized and pooled using a random effect model. Sensitivity analysis, heterogeneity, publication bias, meta-regression and sub-group analyses were also assessed. Ten studies met the pre-defined inclusion criteria and provided 11 cohorts with 7,580 total participants. Leptin levels were positively and significantly associated with risk of increased arterial stiffness (odds ratio 1.04; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01), with no significant heterogeneity among studies. Likewise, pooled analysis of correlation showed a significant and positive association between leptin and pulse wave velocity (z&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.27, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01), with significant heterogeneity among studies. The results of this meta-analysis indicate that leptin is positively associated with arterial stiffness. This association significantly adds to the recognized value of leptin in cardiovascular disease.",

    "abstract": "The worldwide obesity epidemic is a major health problem driven by the modern food environment. Recently, it has been shown that smell perception plays a key role in eating behavior and is altered in obesity. However, the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon are not well understood yet. Since the olfactory system is closely linked to the endocrine system, we hypothesized that hormonal shifts in obesity might explain this relationship. In a within-subject, repeated-measures design, we investigated sensitivity to a food and a non-food odor in the hungry and sated state in 75 young healthy (26 normal weight, 25 overweight, and 24 obese) participants (37 women). To determine metabolic health status and hormonal reactivity in response to food intake, we assessed pre- and postprandial levels of insulin, leptin, glucose, and ghrelin. Odor sensitivity did not directly depend on body weight status/body mass index (BMI) or hunger state. However, we could establish a strong negative mediating effect of insulin resistance on the relationship between BMI/waist-hip ratio and olfactory sensitivity for the food odor. These findings indicate an impact of metabolic health status on sensitivity to food odors. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms behind altered smell perception in obesity.",

    "title": "Effect of weight-loss diet combined with taurine supplementation on body composition and some biochemical markers in obese women: a randomized clinical trial.",
    "abstract": "Taurine (Tau), an endogenous non-protein and sulfuric-amino acid, is involved in various biological pathways including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidation, insulin resistance inhibition, and lipid profile improvement. According to some experimental and clinical studies, insulin resistance and excess body weight are associated with reduced serum level of Tau. Therefore, this study was aimed to evaluate Tau supplementation and a diet-induced weight-loss intervention on body composition and some biochemical indices of obese women. Participants were divided randomly into the intervention (standard weight-loss group&#x2009;+&#x2009;cap Tau 3 g/day for 8&#xa0;weeks, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;20) and control (standard weight-loss group&#x2009;+&#x2009;cap placebo for 8&#xa0;weeks, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;18) groups. To achieve weight loss, all participants received an individualized diet that included a 30% reduction in their total energy intake. Chi-square test was applied to compare categorical variables between two groups at baseline. Paired t test and independent-sample t test were also used to analyze the parametric continuous data within and between the two groups, respectively. Analysis of covariance was run for controlling the confounding variables. At the post-intervention, the mean changes of total cholesterol (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03), leptin (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0. 006), total adiponectin (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04), and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03) decreased significantly in Tau group compared with the control group. No significant results were found in the mean changes of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, anthropometric measurements, glycemic indices, and liver enzymes between the two groups (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). The findings showed that Tau supplementation along with a weight-loss diet may be more effective in improving the lipid profile and metabolic risk factors compared with a weight-loss diet alone.",

    "abstract": "This meta-analysis was performed to obtain a more comprehensive estimation of the role of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2241766 in the ADIPOQ gene in the occurrence of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Relevant studies were identified from digital databases such as Embase, PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, WanFang, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). Odds ratios (ORs) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were pooled by means of fixed- or random-effects models. Interstudy heterogeneity was examined using the Q test and I <sup>2</sup> statistic, and sensitivity analysis was implemented to test the statistical stability of the overall estimates. Begg's funnel plot and Egger's test were applied to inspect potential publication bias among the included studies. The overall ORs reflected a positive correlation between the ADIPOQ rs2241766 polymorphism and susceptibility to DKD in the GG vs. TT and GG vs. TT+TG comparisons (OR = 1.51, 95%CI = 1.16 - 1.95; OR = 1.43, 95%CI = 1.11 - 1.85). After stratification analyses by ethnicity and disease type, a similar trend was also revealed in the Caucasian and African subgroups as well as in the type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) subgroup. The ADIPOQ rs2241766 polymorphism may be associated with an increased risk of DKD, especially in Caucasian and African populations as well as in T2DM patients.",

    "abstract": "Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is observing an accelerating prevalence rate of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) influenced by gene-environment interaction of modifiable and nonmodifiable factors. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the heritability and genetic risk of T2DM in SSA. We reviewed all published articles on T2DM in SSA between January 2000 and December 2019 and available in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Studies that reported on the genetics and/or heritability of T2DM or indicators of glycaemia were included. Data extracted included the study design, records of family history, pattern and characteristics of inheritance, genetic determinants, and effects estimates. The pattern and characteristics of T2DM heritability in SSA are preference for maternal aggregation, higher among first degree compared to second-degree relatives; early age-onset (&lt;50 years), and inherited abnormalities of beta-cell function/mass. The overall prevalence of T2DM was 28.2% for the population with a positive family history (PFH) and 11.2% for the population with negative family history (NFH). The pooled odds ratio of the impact of PFH on T2DM was 3.29 (95% CI: 2.40-4.52). Overall, 28 polymorphisms in 17 genes have been investigated in relation with T2DM in SSA. Almost all studies used the candidate gene approach with most (45.8%) of genetic studies published between 2011 and 2015. Polymorphisms in ABCC8, Haptoglobin, KCNJ11, ACDC, ENPP1, TNF-&#x3b1;, and TCF7L2 were found to be associated with T2DM, with overlapping effect on specific cardiometabolic traits. Genome-wide studies identified ancestry-specific signals (AGMO-rs73284431, VT11A-rs17746147, and ZRANB3) and TCF7L2-rs7903146 as the only transferable genetic risk variants to SSA population. TCF7L2-rs7903146 polymorphism was investigated in multiple studies with consistent effects and low-moderate statistical heterogeneity. Effect sizes were modestly strong [odds&#x2009;ratio = 6.17 (95% CI: 2.03-18.81), codominant model; 2.27 (95% CI: 1.50-3.44), additive model; 1.75 (95% CI: 1.18-2.59), recessive model]. Current evidence on the heritability and genetic markers of T2DM in SSA populations is limited and largely insufficient to reliably inform the genetic architecture of T2DM across SSA regions.",

Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the circulating leptin level, soluble LepR level and related gene polymorphism in SLE patients. We performed a meta-analysis comparing the circulating leptin level, LepR level and their gene polymorphism in patients with SLE to controls, and evaluate the relationship between leptin levels, LepR levels and SLE disease activity. Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane, CNKI, WanFang and VIP databases were searched systematically with no restriction to languages and years (up to Feb. 2020). Stata v. 14.0 was used to calculate statistical data. 34 articles involving 7337 SLE patients and 6866 healthy controls were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with the controls, SLE patients had a significantly higher level of leptin, in particular for active SLE patients, regardless of sample size, source, or assay method. The elevated leptin level was only found in the female SLE group, but not in the male SLE group. Apart from the South American subgroup, other ethnicity subgroups showed significantly higher levels of leptin in SLE patients. A marginally lower level of LepR in SLE patients was also observed. The LepR gene rs1137101 variant (i.e. AG+GG) was borderline significantly associated with the increased risk of SLE. Our meta-analysis revealed thta SLE patients had an elevated leptin level and decreased LepR level. LepR gene rs1137101 mutation might be associated with increased susceptibility to SLE.",

Berries rich in polyphenols and unsaturated fatty acids have been able to prevent both obesity and adipose tissue inflammation, improving metabolic functions in human subjects and animal models of obesity. Ju&#xe7;ara has been considered a super fruit owing to its nutritional composition and relevant biological activities with an interesting response in animals. Thus, we aimed to verify the potential antiobesogenic effect of ju&#xe7;ara supplementation in humans. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial with 35 adults with obesity of both sexes. They were assessed for resting metabolic rate, anthropometry and body composition, blood pressure, metabolic parameters and adipokines. Subsequently, they were randomized into two groups to use or not (placebo) 5 g lyophilized ju&#xe7;ara for 6 weeks. Supplementation with ju&#xe7;ara was significantly effective in reducing body fat, increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and doubling serum adiponectin. Besides, ju&#xe7;ara supplementation, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and neck circumference were predictors to explain the enhancement in adiponectin. Ju&#xe7;ara supplementation was determinant to improve adiponectin levels, and it may be considered a novel strategy for the treatment of obesity-related metabolic diseases.",

HIIT improved circulating adiponectin (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.02), leptin (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.02), and TNF-&#x3b1; (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.003) when compared to CON. There were no differences between groups in IL-6 and CRP. Intervention duration was a significant moderator for the effect of HIIT on IL-6, and leptin (P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.05). High-intensity interval training improves circulating TNF-&#x3b1;, leptin and adiponectin, thereby indicating that it may be an effective and time-efficient intervention for controlling low-grade inflammation in individuals with metabolic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a pro-inflammatory risk factor for progression of CKD and cardiovascular disease. We hypothesized that implementation of caloric restriction and endurance exercise would improve adipocytokine profiles in patients with moderate to severe CKD. We enrolled patients with moderate to severe CKD through a multi-center pilot randomized trial of diet and exercise in a 4-arm design (dietary restriction of 10%-15% reduction in caloric intake, exercise three times/week, combined diet and exercise, and control) (NCT01150851). Adipocytokines (adiponectin and leptin) were measured at the beginning and end of the study period as secondary outcomes. Treatment effect was analyzed in a multivariable model adjusted for baseline outcome values, age, gender, site and diabetes. A total of 122 participants were consented, 111 were randomized (42% female, 25% diabetic, and 91% hypertensive), 104 started intervention and 92 completed the study (Figure&#xa0;1). Plasma adiponectin levels increased significantly in response to diet by 23% (95% CI: 0.2%, 49.8%, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.048) among participants randomized to the caloric restriction and usual activity arm but not to exercise, whereas circulating leptin did not change by either treatment. Our data suggest that dietary caloric restriction increases plasma adiponectin levels in stage 3-4 CKD patients, with limited effect on leptin levels. These findings suggest the potential for improving the metabolic milieu of CKD with moderate calorie restriction.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown a beneficial effect of curcuminoids supplementation on serum concentrations of adipokines; however, there are no published studies that have examined this effect among critically ill patients. We aimed to assess the effects of supplementation with curcuminoids on serum concentrations of leptin and adiponectin in critically ill patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). In this trial, 62 critically ill patients with TBI, aged 18-65&#x2009;years, were randomly allocated to receive either 500&#x2009;mg/day curcuminoids (co-administered with 5 mg/day piperine) or matched placebo for 7&#x2009;days. Patients in both intervention groups received routine treatments for TBI as well as enteral nutrition. Serum concentrations of leptin and adiponectin were measured at baseline and at the end of trial. We found a significant reduction in serum levels of leptin in both curcuminoids (47.1%) and placebo (22.8%) groups; though the magnitude of reduction was greater in the former (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.05). Supplementation with curcumioinds was not found to alter serum concentrations of adiponectin (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;.05). Supplementation with curcumioinds significantly reduced serum levels of leptin but had no significant effect on adiponectin levels in critically ill patients with TBI. Further clinical trials, particularly those with a long-term period, are needed to confirm our findings.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin (APN) has cardioprotective properties and bisoprolol has been reported to increase myocardial APN expression and reduce myocardial damage. Administration of landiolol, which has a higher cardio-selectivity and shorter half-life than bisoprolol, during the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may increase serum APN and high-molecular weight (HMW)-APN, an active form of APN, in patients with stable angina pectoris (SAP). We recruited 70 patients with SAP and randomized them to intravenous landiolol during PCI (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;35) or control group (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;35). The primary endpoint was serum APN and HMW-APN level 3&#xa0;days after PCI. There was no difference in the primary endpoint between the landiolol and control groups (8.93&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.24 vs. 10.18&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.81&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/mL, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.35 and 3.36&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.75 vs. 4.28&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.13&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/mL, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.20) for APN and HMW-APN levels, respectively.

    "title": "Brown adipose tissue transplantation as a novel alternative to obesity treatment: a systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Obesity, a global challenge, is a complex disorder linked to various diseases. Different kinds of treatments are currently used to treat or control this pandemic. Despite their positive effects on controlling obesity, they still have limitations and side effects including digestive problems, difficulties of daily infusion of some drugs, surgical complications, and weight regain. All these issues cause these conventional methods not to have desirable efficacy. In this regard, brown adipose tissue (BAT) transplantation as a new investigational treatment is proposed, which has beneficial effects with no documented side effect in studies up to now. This systematic review protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (Registration Number: CRD42018110045). The systematical search was conducted on Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, Embase, and ProQuest databases. The quality assessments in the included studies and data gathering were conducted independently by two authors. The main variables were anthropometric indices including body weight, levels of leptin, IGF-1, glucagon, adiponectin, fasting blood glucose, and UCP-1. Following the search in mentioned databases, ten articles were entered into this systematic review. In most studies, weight gain and white adipocyte size were reduced in the BAT transplant group. It seems that the transplantation leads to the regeneration of healthy adipose tissue by activating the endogenous BAT. Since BAT transplantation is one of the possible future treatments of obesity, many studies are conducted to evaluate the outcomes and related procedures precisely, so it can finally step into clinical application.",

    "title": "Cardiovascular diseases and metabolic abnormalities associated with obesity: What is the role of inflammatory responses? A systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Obesity is a chronic disease responsible for a high morbidity and mortality rate, with an increasing worldwide prevalence. Obesity is associated with immune responses characterized by chronic systemic inflammation. This article focuses on the mechanisms that explain the proposed link between obesity-associated diseases and inflammation. Also, it describes the role of inflammatory molecules in obesity-associated metabolic abnormalities. More than 200 articles were selected and consulted by an online English search using various electronic search databases. Predefined key-words for the pathogenesis of obesity-induced inflammation and associated diseases, as well as the role of various inflammatory molecules, were used. We have summarized the data of the articles consulted in this research and we have found that obesity is associated with a low-grade inflammation resulting from the change of adipose tissue (AT). The AT produces a variety of inflammatory molecules called adipocytokines that are involved in the onset of systemic low-grade inflammation which is the link between obesity and associated-chronic abnormalities; such as insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, diabetes, and some cancers. Also, we have searched all the inflammatory molecules involved in this pathogenesis and we have briefly described the role of 16 of them which are the most related to obesity-associated inflammation. The results have shown that there are inflammatory molecules that have a positive relationship with the pathogenesis of obesity-related diseases and others have a negative relationship with this pathogenesis. Inflammation plays a crucial role in the development of various metabolic-abnormalities related to obesity. In this regard, the management of obesity may help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and other metabolic complications by inhibiting inflammatory mechanisms.",

Despite not being fully understood, obesity-related EAC seems to have different carcinogenic pathways. This comprehensive review will thoroughly evaluate the current literature, describing the underlying mechanisms that help understanding the strong association between obesity and esophageal cancer. The risk of esophageal cancer among obese individuals could be partially explained by several factors: high prevalence of GERD; linear association between central adiposity and Barrett&#xb4;s esophagus development; low levels of adiponectin and high levels of leptin that alter cell proliferation processes; insulin-resistant state that creates a tumorigenesis environment; and changes in the esophageal microbiota due to unhealthy dietary habits that promote carcinogenesis.

    "abstract": "Recently, some studies claim that adipokines may modulate plasma lipids. More interestingly, the ADRB3 Trp64Arg polymorphism may regulate adipokines and play an essential role in lipids metabolism. This study aims to clarify the associations of ADRB3 Trp64Arg polymorphism with plasma adipokines and lipid levels. Twenty-two studies (5527 subjects) and 121 studies (54,059 subjects) were respectively identified for the association analyses of adipokines and lipids. Standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to estimate the strength of the Trp64Arg variant in adipokines and plasma lipids. All results were recalculated after eliminating the studies with heterogeneity. The carriers of the C allele (Arg at 64th position was encoded by the C allele) had higher levels of leptin and lower levels of adiponectin than the non-carriers. The carriers of the C allele had higher levels of triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) than the non-carriers. Subgroup analysis certified an ethnicity (Asians), disease status (obesity), and gender (females) specific association. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the analysis results were robust and stable. Meta-regression indicated that obesity was related to adiponectin. The C allele carriers of Trp64Arg polymorphism had a slight but significant influence on lipid levels, and the remarkable effects specific existed in obese Asian women. The associations of Trp64Arg polymorphism with dyslipidemia may partly be mediated by the effect of this polymorphism on adipokines. The association of Trp64Arg polymorphism with obesity may partly be mediated by the effect of this polymorphism on adipokines. The C allele carriers had abnormal levels of adipokines and lipids, and it indicated that the Trp64Arg polymorphism might represent a genetic risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD).",

    "abstract": "Evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggests that coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) can regulate adipokine levels to impact inflammation and oxidative stress in conditions of metabolic syndrome. Here, prominent electronic databases such as MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE were searched for eligible RCTs reporting on any correlation between adipokine levels and modulation of inflammation and oxidative stress in individuals with metabolic syndrome taking CoQ10. The risk of bias was assessed using the modified Black and Downs checklist, while the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool was used to evaluate the quality of evidence. Results from the current meta-analysis, involving 318 participants, showed that CoQ10 supplementation in individuals with metabolic syndrome increased adiponectin levels when compared to those on placebo (SMD: 1.44 [95% CI: -0.13, 3.00]; I<sup>2</sup> = 96%, p &lt; 0.00001). Moreover, CoQ10 supplementation significantly lowered inflammation markers in individuals with metabolic syndrome in comparison to those on placebo (SMD: -0.31 [95% CI: -0.54, -0.08]; I<sup>2</sup> = 51%, p = 0.07). Such benefits with CoQ10 supplementation were related to its ameliorative effects on lipid peroxidation by reducing malondialdehyde levels, concomitant to improving glucose control and liver function. The overall findings suggest that optimal regulation of adipokine function is crucial for the beneficial effects of CoQ10 in improving metabolic health.",

    "abstract": "Background: Prediabetes has proven to have many unfavourable impacts on the cardiovascular system.Methods: The OPERA (Oulu Project Elucidating Risk of Atherosclerosis) study included 1045 middle-aged subjects followed from the years 1990-1993 to 2014. The focus was on peptide hormones.Results: Plasma resistin levels were higher among prediabetics (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.001), particularly impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001), but not impaired fasting glucose (IFG) patients than among normal glucose tolerance (NGT) or diabetes groups. Diabetics showed lower resistin levels than IGT subjects (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). IGT or diabetes groups showed lower adiponectin and higher leptin levels compared to the NGT group (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). The IFG group had the highest blood pressure and left ventricular mass index, even higher than the diabetic group.

Serum liver enzyme levels, lipid profile, adiponectin concentrations, and hepatic steatosis grade were measured for all patients at baseline and the end of the trial. GCE supplementation significantly reduced BMI [mean difference (MD): -0.57 and 95 % confidence interval (CI): -0.84 to -0.29, P&#x202f;&lt;&#x202f;0.001] and increased serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD: 7.06, 95 % CI: 0.25-13.87, P&#x202f;&lt;&#x202f;0.05) compared to the control group.

    "title": "Association between serum adiponectin concentrations and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin has been implicated to play a role in the pathophysiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Many studies have assessed serum adiponectin concentrations in COPD patients. However, results from different reports were not consistent. To assess the association of serum adiponectin concentrations and COPD, a meta-analysis was performed. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library were searched for eligible studies. Data were extracted, and then standard mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Thirteen studies involving a total of 1131 cases and 689 controls were included in this meta-analysis. Combined data indicated that the serum adiponectin levels were higher in COPD patients than those in controls (SMD: 1.09, 95% CI [0.73-1.45], P &lt; 0.001). In the subgroup analyses by disease period, there were similar results in stable COPD patients (SMD: 0.77, 95% CI [0.47-1.07], p &lt;0.001; I2 = 83.9%, P &lt; 0.001), AECOPD patients (SMD: 2.51, 95% CI [0.71-4.30], P = 0.006; I2 = 95.2%, P &lt; 0.001) and mixed COPD patients (SMD: 1.21, 95% CI [0.67-1.75], P &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, the serum adiponectin levels were higher in AECOPD patients than those in stable COPD patients (SMD: 1.06, 95% CI [0.13-1.99], P = 0.026). This meta-analysis indicates that patients with COPD have higher serum adiponectin concentration than healthy controls.",

    "title": "Leptin levels are not affected by enalapril treatment after an uncomplicated myocardial infarction, but associate strongly with changes in fibrinolytic variables in men.",
    "abstract": "Leptin, an adipocyte-derived hormone, is involved in the regulation of body weight and is associated with obesity-related complications, notably cardiovascular disease (CVD). A putative link between obesity and CVD could be induction of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) synthesis by leptin. In this study, we hypothesized that the beneficial effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) enalapril on PAI-1 levels is mediated by effects on leptin levels. The association between leptin and components of the fibrinolytic system was evaluated in a non-prespecified post hoc analysis of a placebo-controlled randomized, double-blind trial where the effect of the ACEi enalapril on fibrinolysis was tested. A total of 46 men and 37 women were randomized to treatment with enalapril or placebo after (median 12&#x2009;months) an uncomplicated myocardial infarction. At baseline, the participants were stable and had no signs of congestive heart failure. Leptin and fibrinolytic variables (mass concentrations of PAI-1, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and tPA-PAI complex) were measured at baseline, and after 10&#x2009;days, 6&#x2009;months and 12&#x2009;months. Enalapril treatment did not change leptin levels, which increased significantly during 1 year of follow-up (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.007). Changes in leptin levels were strongly associated with changes of tPA mass (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.001), tPA-PAI complex (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.003) and of PAI-1 (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.006) in men, but not in women. Leptin levels are not influenced by treatment with an ACEi. In contrast, leptin associates strongly with changes in fibrinolytic variables notably with a sex difference, which could be of importance for obesity-related CVD.",

    "title": "Reduced circulating levels of chemokine CXCL14 in adolescent girls with polycystic ovary syndrome: normalization after insulin sensitization.",
    "abstract": "CXCL14 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand-14) is a chemokine released by active brown fat, showing protective effects against insulin resistance in experimental models. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in adolescent girls is usually related to hepato-visceral fat excess and insulin resistance, and associates with comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes. Treatment with a low-dose combination of one antiandrogen and antimineralocorticoid drug (spironolactone) and two insulin sensitizers (pioglitazone/metformin) (SPIOMET) is particularly effective in improving these metabolic derangements. Adipose tissue may be involved in the metabolic alterations of PCOS, and it is a likely target of therapeutic action. We investigated the alterations in CXCL14 levels and the effects of drugs composing SPIOMET treatment on CXCL14 in human adipocytes. We studied 51 adolescent patients with PCOS and 21 age-matched healthy controls. Thirty-one adolescent patients with PCOS under SPIOMET or oral contraception-based treatment were also studied. For studies in vitro, Simpson Golabi Behmel Syndrome (SGBS) adipose cells were used. Gene expression for CXCL14 and other genes was quantified using quantitative real-time PCR. The levels of CXCL14 and adipokines in serum and cell culture media were determined by ELISA. Serum CXCL14 levels are reduced in patients with PCOS. One-year SPIOMET treatment normalized CXCL14 concentrations and improved the metabolic status of patients with PCOS. Pioglitazone induced CXCL14 expression in differentiating human SGBS adipocytes, in parallel with the induction of marker genes of brown adipogenesis. Spironolactone induced CXCL14 expression and release in differentiated human adipocytes. Insulin sensitization with SPIOMET normalizes the abnormally low levels of CXCL14 in girls with PCOS. This is consistent with the effects of pioglitazone and spironolactone inducing CXCL14 expression and promoting a brown-like phenotype in adipocytes. CXCL14 may be a novel biomarker for PCOS as well as a potential mediator of the beneficial effects of the SPIOMET combination and may hold promise as a therapeutic modulator of the disorder.

This study assessed the effects of GTE on endurance training (ET) induced changes on irisin, pro-inflammatory cytokines, adiponectin and anthropometric indices in overweight middle-aged males. Participants were randomly assigned to three groups (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;15): endurance training&#x2009;+&#x2009;placebo (ET&#x2009;+&#x2009;P), endurance training&#x2009;+&#x2009;green tea extract supplementation (ET&#x2009;+&#x2009;GTE), and no endurance training&#x2009;+&#x2009;placebo (P). The ET intervention consisted of an 8-week training program that included circuit training, fast walking or jogging performed three times/week at a moderate intensity (40-59% of the heart rate reserve). Participants received 500&#xa0;mg/day GTE using a green tea capsule. Serum concentrations of interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#x3b1;), irisin, adiponectin, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were measured prior to and after the 8-week training intervention. Both exercise interventions decreased IL-6 and hs-CRP (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05), and increased adiponectin (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01) levels; changes in these variables were greater in the ET&#x2009;+&#x2009;GTE group compared to the ET&#x2009;+&#x2009;P and P groups (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01).

    "abstract": "The differential diagnosis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) between Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) is important for designing an effective therapeutic regimen. However, without any adequate gold standard method for differential diagnosis currently, therapeutic design remains a major challenge in clinical practice. In this context, recent studies have showed that circulating leptin stands out as a potential biomarker for the categorization of IBDs. Thus, we aimed to summarize the current understanding of the prognostic and diagnostic value of serum leptin in patients with IBDs. A systematic search was performed in PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases. Articles that aimed to study the relationship between circulating levels of leptin and IBDs were included. Finally, the meta-analysis was performed with the mean serum leptin levels in patients with IBDs and healthy controls using RevMan 5.3 software, with I2 &gt; 50% as a criterion for substantial heterogeneity. Nineteen studies were included. Serum leptin levels among patients with IBDs and healthy controls did not show a significant difference (95% CI, -2.15 to 0.57; I2, 86%, P &#x2264; 0.00001). Similarly, there was no association of leptin levels with the activity of IBDs (95% CI, -0.24 to 0.06; I2, 50%; P = 0.13). However, serum leptin levels were significantly higher in patients with CD than those in patients with UC (95% CI, -2.09 to -0.37; I2, 7%; P &#x2264; 0.36). This review suggested that serum leptin levels might be a promising biomarker to help in the differentiation between CD and UC.",

    "abstract": "Early-life exposure to improved nutrition is associated with decreased risk of diabetes but increased risk of obesity. Leptin positively correlates with adiposity and has glucose-lowering effects, thus it may mediate the association of early-life nutrition and long-term glycemic status. We aimed to investigate the role of leptin in the differential association between early-life nutrition and the risks of obesity and diabetes. We analyzed data from a Guatemalan cohort who were randomly assigned at the village level to receive nutritional supplements as children. We conducted mediation analysis to examine the role of leptin in the associations of early-life nutrition and adult cardiometabolic outcomes. Among 1112 study participants aged (mean&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;SD) 44.1&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;4.2 y, 60.6% were women. Cardiometabolic conditions were common: 40.2% of women and 19.4% of men were obese, and 53.1% of women and 41.0% of men were hyperglycemic or diabetic. Median (IQR) leptin concentration was 15.2&#xa0;ng/mL (10.2-17.3&#xa0;ng/mL) in women and 2.7&#xa0;ng/mL (1.3-5.3&#xa0;ng/mL) in men. Leptin was positively correlated with BMI (Spearman's &#x3c1; was 0.6 in women, 0.7 in men). Women exposed to improved nutrition in early life had 2.8-ng/mL (95% CI: 0.3, 5.3&#xa0;ng/mL) higher leptin and tended to have lower fasting glucose (-0.8&#xa0;mmol/L; -1.8, 0.2&#xa0;mmol/L, nonsignificant) than unexposed women. There were no significant differences in leptin (-0.7&#xa0;ng/mL; -2.1, 0.8&#xa0;ng/mL) or fasting glucose (0.2&#xa0;mmol/L; -0.5, 0.9&#xa0;mmol/L) in men exposed to improved nutrition in early life compared with unexposed men. Leptin mediated 34.9% of the pathway between early-life nutrition and fasting glucose in women. The mediation in women was driven by improved pancreatic &#x3b2;-cell function. We did not observe the mediation effect in men. Leptin mediated the glucose-lowering effect of early-life nutrition in women but not in men.",

We searched Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar, and ISI Web of Science from inception up to July 2019. Mean difference for leptin and adiponectin were calculated by subtracting the change from baseline in each study group. Summary estimates for the overall effect of ALA on serum leptin and adiponectin concentrations were calculated using random effects model.

The aim of this systematic review is to accumulate current literature evidence in order to examine the pattern of serum adipokine levels among preeclamptic women and asses their potential efficacy in the prediction of the disease. Medline, Scopus, CENTRAL, Clinicaltrials.gov and Google Scholar databases were systematically searched from inception. All observational studies reporting serum adipokine values among preeclamptic and healthy pregnant women were held eligible. A total of 163 studies were included, comprising 23,482 women. Leptin was evaluated in 91 studies and its values were found to be significantly elevated in preeclamptic women during all pregnancy trimester, independently of disease onset and severity. Preeclampsia was also associated with increased serum fatty acid binding protein-4 and chemerin levels, when measured both during the 1st and 3rd trimester. Data concerning the rest adipokines were either conflicting or limited to reach firm conclusions. Quality of evidence was evaluated to be high for leptin, moderate for serum fatty acid binding protein-4 and chemerin and low for the other adipokines. The existing evidence suggests that preeclampsia is linked to increased levels of leptin, chemerin and fatty acid binding protein-4 in all pregnancy trimesters and forms of the disease. Inconsistent data currently exists concerning the role of the other adipokines. Large-scale prospective studies should longitudinally evaluate the serum concentration of novel adipokines and define the optimal threshold and timing of measurement to be widely applied in clinical practice.",

    "title": "Metformin use in obese mothers is associated with improved cardiovascular profile in the offspring.",
    "abstract": "Maternal obesity increases the risk for pregnancy complications and adverse neonatal outcome and has been associated with long-lasting adverse effects in the offspring, including increased body fat mass, insulin resistance, and increased risk for premature cardiovascular disease. Lifestyle interventions in pregnancy have produced no or modest effects in the reduction of adverse pregnancy outcomes in obese mothers. The Metformin in Obese Pregnant Women trial was associated with reduced adverse pregnancy outcomes and had no effect on birthweight. However, the long-term implications of metformin on the health of offspring remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to assess whether prenatal exposure to metformin can improve the cardiovascular profile and body composition in the offspring of obese mothers. In 151 children from the Metformin in Obese Pregnant Women trial, body composition, peripheral blood pressure, and arterial pulse wave velocity were measured. Central hemodynamics (central blood pressure and augmentation index) were estimated with the use of an oscillometric device. Left ventricular cardiac function and structure were assessed by echocardiography. Children were 3.9&#xb1;1.0 years old, and 77 of them had been exposed to metformin prenatally. There was no significant difference in peripheral blood pressure, arterial stiffness, and body composition apart from gluteal and tricep circumferences, which were lower in the metformin group (P&lt;.05). The metformin group, compared with the placebo group,&#xa0;had lower central hemodynamics (mean adjusted decrease, -0.707&#xa0;mm&#xa0;Hg for aortic systolic blood pressure, -1.65 mm Hg for aortic pulse pressure, and -2.68% for augmentation index; P&lt;.05 for all) and lower left ventricular diastolic function (adjusted difference in left atrial area, -0.525 cm<sup>2</sup>, in isovolumic relaxation time, -0.324 msec, and in pulmonary venous systolic wave, 2.97 cm/s; P&lt;.05 for all). There were no significant differences in metabolic profile between the groups. Children of obese mothers who were exposed prenatally to metformin, compared with those who were exposed to placebo, had lower central hemodynamic and cardiac diastolic indices. These results suggest that the administration of metformin in obese pregnant women potentially may have a beneficial cardiovascular effect for their offspring.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia are diseases that collectively increase the risk of patients developing cardiovascular complications. Several incretin-based drugs are reported to improve lipid metabolism, and one of these medications, anagliptin, is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor that has been shown to decrease serum triglyceride and low-density lipoproteins cholesterol. This study aimed to conduct an investigation into the effects of anagliptin on serum lipid profiles. This multicenter, open-label, randomized (1:1), parallel group study was designed to evaluate the effects of anagliptin on serum lipid profiles (triglycerides, lipoproteins, apolipoproteins, and cholesterol fractions). The study involved 24 patients with type 2 diabetes at two participating hospitals for a period of 24 weeks. Patients were randomly assigned to the anagliptin (n = 12) or control (n = 12) groups. Patients in the anagliptin group were treated with 200 mg of the drug twice daily. Patients in the control group did not receive anagliptin, but continued with their previous treatment schedules. Lipid metabolism was examined under fasting conditions at baseline and 24 weeks. Patients treated with anagliptin for 24 weeks exhibited significantly reduced levels of serum apolipoprotein B-48, a marker for lipid transport from the intestine, compared with the control group patients (P &lt; 0.05). After 24 weeks of treatment, serum adiponectin levels were significantly raised, whereas glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were significantly lower compared with the baseline in the anagliptin group (P &lt; 0.05), but not in the control group. This study showed that the DPP-4 inhibitor anagliptin reduces fasting apolipoprotein B-48 levels, suggesting that this drug may have beneficial effects on lipid metabolism possibly mediated by the inhibition of intestinal lipid transport.",

    "title": "The effects of flaxseed supplementation on metabolic status in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a randomized open-labeled controlled clinical trial.",
    "abstract": "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is known as the most common endocrine disorder of women in reproductive ages. With the increasing prevalence of PCOS in different countries, the use of herbal medicine as an alternative treatment is growing in these patients. This&#x2002;study&#x2002;aimed&#x2002;to&#x2002;evaluate&#x2002;the&#x2002;effects of flaxseed powder supplementation on metabolic biomarkers of patients with PCOS. This randomized open-labeled controlled clinical trial was conducted on 41 patients with PCOS. The participants were randomized to take either flaxseed powder (30&#x2009;g/day) plus lifestyle modification or only lifestyle modification for 12&#x2009;weeks. Anthropometric and biochemical evaluations were performed for all patients at the beginning and end of the study. The flaxseed group showed a significant reduction in body weight, insulin concentration, Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), Triglycerides (TG), high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP), and leptin and an increase in Quantitative Insulin-Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI), High Density Lipoprotein (HDL), and adiponectin compared to the baseline (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Flaxseed supplementation also led to a significant reduction in insulin concentration, HOMA-IR, TG, hs-CRP, Interleukin 6 (IL- 6), and leptin and an increase in QUICKI, HDL, and adiponectin compared to the control group (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). No significant changes were observed in other parameters. Flaxseed supplementation plus lifestyle modification was more effective compared to lifestyle modification alone in biochemical and anthropometric variables in patients with PCOS. The trial protocol was approved by the Ethics Board at Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences and was registered at Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (code: IRCT20120704010181N11).",

    "abstract": "Abdominal obesity is characterized by low-grade inflammation and plays a central role in the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Dietary factors can influence low-grade inflammation and affect adipose tissue function. To investigate the separate and combined effects of whey protein and cereal fiber on inflammatory markers and adipose tissue gene expression in abdominal obesity. We performed a 12-week, double-blind, randomized controlled dietary intervention in 65 adults with abdominal obesity. The participants were randomized to 4 groups using a 2 &#xd7; 2 factorial design; they received either 60 g/day of whey protein or maltodextrin in combination with high-fiber wheat bran products (30 g fiber/day) or low-fiber refined wheat products (10 g fiber/day). Plasma concentrations of tumor necrosis factor &#x3b1; (TNF-&#x3b1;), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), and adiponectin were measured before and after intervention. Changes in gene expression related to inflammation, insulin signaling, and lipid metabolism were measured in abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue. After intervention, TNF-&#x3b1; was reduced for both high-fiber groups compared with baseline, but did not significantly differ from the low-fiber groups. There were no differences in fasting or postprandial inflammatory markers between the groups. The relative gene expression of ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1 (S6K1) was increased after whey protein compared with maltodextrin consumption. Intake of whey protein in combination with high cereal fiber content did not differentially affect low-grade inflammation or adipose tissue gene expression compared with maltodextrin and low fiber content in individuals with abdominal obesity.",

    "abstract": "Increased leptin and decreased adiponectin levels are reported in coronary artery disease (CAD) as well as in obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Less is known regarding the impact of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on these biomarkers. We aimed to determine variables associated with leptin and adiponectin in adults with CAD and nonsleepy OSA, and evaluate the effect of CPAP adjusted for confounding factors. This was one of the secondary outcomes of the RICCADSA trial, conducted in Sweden between 2005 and 2013. From 244 revascularized CAD and OSA patients (apnoea-hypopnoea index &gt;15/h) without excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale score &lt;10), 196 with blood samples at baseline, after 3, and 12 months were included in the randomized controlled trial arm; of those, 98 were allocated to auto-titrating CPAP, and 98 to no-CPAP. No significant changes in leptin and adiponectin levels were observed during follow-up, whereas Body-Mass-Index and waist circumference increased in both CPAP and no-CPAP groups with no significant between-group differences. Alterations in plasma leptin were determined by changes in waist circumference (beta coefficient 2.47; 95% confidence interval 0.77-4.40), whereas none of the analyzed parameters was predictive for changes in adiponectin levels. No association was found with CPAP adherence. CPAP had no significant effect on leptin and adiponectin in this cohort of nonsleepy OSA patients. An increase in waist circumference predicted an increase in plasma levels of leptin after 12 months, suggesting that lifestyle modifications should be given priority in adults with CAD and OSA regardless of CPAP treatment.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the roles of adiponectin (ADIPOQ) rs266729 and melatonin receptor 1B (MTNR1B) rs10830963 polymorphisms in patients with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The databases including Web of science, PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched for case-control studies updating on Feb 15th, 2019. 12 studies were finally included containing 3759 GDM patients and 4422 controls. The associations between two polymorphic sites (rs266729 and rs10830963) and GDM susceptibility were analyzed according to the pooled odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Our pooled results indicated that ADIPOQ rs266729 can increase the GDM risk in Asian (dominant: GG+CG vs. CC, OR&#xa0;= 2.079, 95%CI: 1.012-4.270, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.046) and European (allele: G vs. C, OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.353, 95%CI: 1.001-1.829, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.049 dominant: GG+CG vs. CC, OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.522, 95%CI: 1.031-2.245, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.034 heterozygote: CG vs. CC, OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.517, 95%CI: 1.006-2.287, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.047), but decrease in American population (allele: G vs. C, OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.663, 95%CI: 0.501-0.878, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.004 (dominant: GG+CG vs. CC, OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.642, 95%CI: 0.456-0.903, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.011 recessive: GG vs. CC+CG, OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.496, 95%CI: 0.250-0.981, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.044).

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is enhanced by various mechanisms. Serum oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is a useful prognostic marker in diabetic patients with coronary artery disease. To examine the effects of Theracurmin&#xae;, a highly absorbable curcumin preparation, on glucose tolerance, adipocytokines, and oxidized LDL, we conducted a double-blind placebo-controlled parallel group randomized trial in patients with impaired glucose tolerance or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. We randomly divided the patients with impaired glucose tolerance or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and stable individuals into the placebo group and the Theracurmin&#xae; (180&#x2009;mg daily for 6 months) group. Of the 33 patients analyzed, 18 (14 males and 4 females) were administered placebo and 15 (9 males and 6 females) were administered Theracurmin&#xae;. The patient characteristics did not differ between the two groups. The primary endpoint, HbA1c, did not differ significantly between the two groups. However, the level of &#x3b1;1-antitrypsin-low-density lipoprotein (AT-LDL), the oxidized LDL, significantly increased (p = 0.024) in the placebo group from the beginning of the trial up to 6 months, although there was no such change in the Theracurmin&#xae; group. The percentage change in BMI from the beginning of the trial up to 6 months tended to be higher in the Theracurmin&#xae; group than in the placebo group. Patients in the Theracurmin&#xae; group tended to have a larger percentage change in adiponectin and LDL-C than those in the placebo group. Patients in the Theracurmin&#xae; group showed a smaller percentage change in AT-LDL than those in the placebo group. This study suggests that the highly absorbable curcumin could potentially inhibit a rise in oxidized LDL in patients with impaired glucose tolerance or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the prognostic value of elevated adiponectin level in CAD patients. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed and Embase databases up to May 10, 2019. Studies evaluating the association between adiponectin level and major adverse cardiovascular events (death, stroke, acute coronary syndrome or coronary revascularisation), cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality in CAD patients were included. Pooled multivariable adjusted risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) was calculated for the highest vs the lowest category of adiponectin level. Twelve studies including 10,974 CAD patients were included. Elevated adiponectin level was independently associated with higher risk of cardiovascular (RR 1.93; 95% CI 1.55-2.42; p&#xa0;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and all-cause mortality (RR 1.96; 95% CI 1.64-2.34; p&#xa0;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) in CAD patients. However, CAD patients with higher adiponectin level did not significantly increase major cardiovascular events risk (RR 1.12; 95% CI 0.86-1.45; p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.407) after adjustment for potential confounders. This meta-analysis indicates that elevated adiponectin level is an independent predictor of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in CAD patients. Measurement of blood adiponectin level has potential to identify CAD patients who have high risk of death.",

Subjects were randomly divided into two groups (exercise intervention [EXP; n = 10] and control [CON; n = 10]). The EXP subjects performed resistance and aerobic exercise training program three times per week for 12 weeks, and the CON subjects maintained their regular lifestyle during the intervention period. Body composition was estimated using bioelectrical impedance analysis equipment. Cardiometabolic biomarkers (glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), HOMA &#x3b2;-cell function, and leptin) and RBC hemorheological parameters (RBC deformability and aggregation) were analyzed. Percent body fat decreased significantly in the EXP group during the intervention period but increased significantly in the CON group. Insulin increased significantly in the CON group over the 12-week period and both insulin and HOMA-IR were significantly higher in the CON group than in the EXP group at post-test. RBC deformability (RBC EI_3Pa) and aggregation (RBC AI_3Pa) improved significantly only in the EXP group. The present study suggests that combined exercise training can be useful for improving cardiometabolic biomarkers and RBC hemorheological parameters in obese older men and may help prevent metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases.",

Recent data have demonstrated that the expression of Nrg4 is substantially down-regulated in mouse and human obesity, making its regulatory aspect intriguing. Because of the close relationship between Nrg4, obesity, and associated metabolic diseases, this systematic review aimed to assess the association of Nrg4 with obesity and related metabolic disturbances, emphasizing its possible mechanisms of action in these disorders. We searched PubMed/Medline, ScienceDirect, Scopus, EMBASE, ProQuest, and Google Scholar up until June 2019. The evidence reviewed here indicates that Nrg4 may contribute to the prevention of obesity and related metabolic complications by elevating brown adipose tissue activity, increasing the expression of thermogenic markers, decreasing the expression of lipogenic/adipogenic genes, exacerbating white adipose tissue browning, increasing the number of brite/beige adipocytes, promoting hepatic fat oxidation and ketogenesis, inducing neurite outgrowth, enhancing blood vessels in adipose tissue, increasing the circulatory levels of healthy adipokines, and improving glucose homeostasis. Thus, Nrg4 appears to be a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of obesity and associated metabolic complications. However, prospective cohort studies are warranted to confirm these outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The predictive value of serum adiponectin for hypertensive cardiovascular outcomes is unknown. This study was performed to investigate the association of adiponectin with incident cardiovascular and renal events (CV events) in hypertensive patients. We performed post-hoc analysis on 1,228 hypertensive patients enrolled in the ATTEMPT-CVD study, a prospective randomized study comparing the effects of two antihypertensive therapies. The participants were divided into quartiles of baseline serum total adiponectin or high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed to determine the prognostic factors associated with CV events. Kaplan-Meier analysis for CV events by quartiles of baseline total adiponectin showed that patients in the highest total adiponectin quartile (Q4) had more CV events (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0135). On the other hand, no significant difference was noted regarding the incidence of CV events among patients stratified by HMW adiponectin quartile (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.2551). Even after adjustment for potential confounders, the highest total adiponectin quartile (Q4) remained independently associated with incident CV events in hypertensive patients (HR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.949: 95%CI 1.051-3.612; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0341). These results showed that total adiponectin, but not HMW adiponectin, was independently associated with the incidence of CV events in treated hypertensive patients, thereby highlighting total adiponectin as a valuable predictor for hypertensive cardiovascular outcomes.",

Fetal biometry including abdominal circumference (AC), estimated fetal weight (EFW), and adiposity measurements (mid-thigh fat mass, subscapular fat mass, abdominal fat mass) were obtained from ultrasound assessments at 28 and 36&#x2009;weeks' gestation. Maternal markers included C reactive protein (CRP), leptin and adiponectin concentrations, measured at 28 and 36&#x2009;weeks' gestation and fasting triglycerides and glucose concentrations measured at 28&#x2009;weeks' gestation. There were negative associations identified between maternal serum adiponectin and fetal ultrasound markers of biometry and adiposity.

    "abstract": "The evidence that fetal life and early infancy are critical or sensitive ages for later development of cardiometabolic disease is based on flawed methods for comparing different age periods. Moreover, most previous studies have limited their focus to weight gain, rather than growth in length/height or body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)2). We undertook a secondary analysis of data from the Promotion of Breastfeeding Intervention Trial (1996-2010), a birth cohort study nested within a large cluster-randomized trial in the Republic of Belarus, that had repeated measurements of weight and length/height taken from birth to 11.5 years of age. We used mixed-effects linear models to analyze associations of changes in standardized weight, length/height, and body mass index during 5 age periods (conception to birth, birth to age 3 months, ages 3-12 months, ages 12 months-6.5 years, and ages 6.5-11.5 years) with fasting glucose, insulin, insulin resistance, &#x3b2;-cell function, and adiponectin at age 11.5 years. We observed strong associations between the metabolic markers and all 3 growth measures, with the largest magnitudes being observed during the latest age period (ages 6.5-11.5 years) and negligible associations during gestation and the first year of life. Later age periods appear more sensitive than earlier periods to the adverse metabolic association with rapid growth in childhood.",

    "abstract": "There are still no FDA approved drugs for NAFLD so far. Vitamin D may be a good therapeutic option for NAFLD patients due to its insulin sensitizing and anti-inflammatory properties. The purpose is to investigate the effect of oral vitamin D supplementation on various parameters in NAFLD patients. In this double blind randomized placebo controlled trial, 109 patients of NAFLD diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound and liver enzymes were divided into two groups for treatment with oral capsule of vitamin D3 50,000 IU and capsule placebo weekly for a period of 12 weeks. Anthropometric, chemical, metabolic and inflammatory parameters were assessed pre and post treatment by using SPSS 16. After 12 weeks oral treatment with vitamin D , its level increased significantly in vitamin D group from 12.5&#xb1;4.2 to 24.5&#xb1;3.8 ng/ml p =0.003 vs placebo group. This rise was further accompanied by decrease in HOMA-IR (4.56&#xb1;1.6 to 3.26&#xb1; 1.8 p=0.003) liver enzymes (i.e. ALT: 72.&#xb1;17.6 to 54.5&#xb1;14.5 IU/L p=0.04; AST: 68&#xb1;14.5 to 46.&#xb1; 10.5 p =0.002) serum CRP 3.25&#xb1;0.68 to 2.28&#xb1;0.44 mg/L p =0.06 and increase in serum adiponectin 8.56 &#xb1;1.12 to 10.44&#xb1;2.35 mg/L p =0.03 as compared to placebo group. However non significant changes were observed in both groups in terms of body weight, BMI, and serum lipid profiles. Vitamin D supplementation not only improved its own status but also caused a significant amelioration in metabolic, chemical and inflammatory parameters in NAFLD patients. So it should be consider as an adjunctive therapy in NAFLD patients.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety, mood, trauma- and stressor-related disorders confer increased risk for metabolic disease. Adiponectin, a cytokine released by adipose tissue is associated with these disorders and obesity via inflammatory processes. Available data describing associations with mental disorders remain limited and conflicted. A systematic search was conducted for English, peer-reviewed articles from inception until February 2019 that assessed for serum or plasma adiponectin levels in adults with an anxiety, mood or trauma-related disorder. Diagnoses were determined by psychiatric interview, based on DSM-IV, DSM-5 or ICD-10 criteria. Analyses were performed using STATA 15 and Standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval was applied to pool the effect size of meta-analysis studies. In total 65 eligible studies were included in the systematic review and 30 studies in this meta-analysis. 19,178 participants (11,262 females and 7916 males), comprising healthy adults and adults with anxiety, mood and trauma-related disorders, were included. Overall results indicated an inverse association between adiponectin levels and examined mental disorders. Specifically, patients with an anxiety disorder (SMD&#x200a;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-1.18&#x202f;&#xb5;g/mL, 95% CI, -2.34; -0.01, p&#xa0;&#x200a;=&#xa0;0.047); trauma or stressor-related disorder (SMD&#xa0;&#x200a;=&#xa0;&#x200a;-0.34&#x202f;&#xb5;g/mL, 95% CI, -0.52; -0.17, p&#xa0;&#x200a;=&#xa0;0.0000) or bipolar disorder (SMD&#x200a;&#xa0;=&#xa0;&#x200a;-0.638&#x202f;&#xb5;g/mL, 95% CI, -1.16, -0.12, p&#xa0;&#x200a;=&#xa0;0.017) had significant lower adiponectin levels compared to healthy adults. Heterogeneity, potential publication bias, and lack of control for important potential confounders were significant limitations. Peripheral adiponectin levels appear to be inversely associated with anxiety, mood, trauma- and stressor related disorders and may be a promising biomarker for diagnosis and disease monitoring.",

The random effects model was used for deriving a summary of mean estimates with their corresponding SDs. Out of 313 records, 6 trials that enrolled 652 subjects were included. The pooled results showed that curcumin supplementation significantly increased adiponectin concentrations in comparison with placebo (WMD: 0.82 Hedges' g; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.33 to 1.30, P&#x2c2;0.001).

    "abstract": "Menopause, which occurs following a declined ovarian activity and reduced estrogen levels, can lead to long-term changes in lipid and glycemic profiles and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. Cornelian cherry (Cornus mas) is rich in phytochemicals and antioxidants, which appears to be useful in reducing the postmenopausal complications. This interventional, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial carried out on 84 menopaused women aged 45-60 years old. They were randomly divided into two groups. The treatment group received three capsules of 300 mg of Cornus mas extract (CME), and control group received three capsules of 300 mg of starch powder per day for 8 weeks. Then, BMI, waist circumference, glycemic indices, lipid profile, serum apoproteinase, apoprotein B100, fibrinogen, and leptin were measured. The dietary intakes were evaluated using 24-hr dietary recall questionnaire. The consumption of CME in comparison with the control group resulted in a significant reduction in weight, body mass index, waist circumference, LDL to HDL ratio, total cholesterol to HDL ratio, and fibrinogen. There was also a significant increase in HDL and ApoA1 levels in the treatment group. Furthermore, there was a significant decrease in BMI, waist circumference, fasting insulin, and insulin resistance index after 8 weeks of using CME. Summing up the results, it can be concluded that CME can have possible effects on decreasing BMI, waist circumference, and improving some aspects of lipid profile and glycemic indices in postmenopausal women.",

    "abstract": "Cholesterol efflux is the initial step in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway by which excess cholesterol in peripheral cells is exported and subsequently packaged into high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. Adiponectin is the most abundantly secreted adipokine that possesses anti-inflammatory and vasculoprotective properties via interaction with transmembrane receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2. Evidence suggests that low levels of adiponectin may be a useful marker for atherosclerotic disease. A proposed anti-atherogenic mechanism of adiponectin involves its ability to promote cholesterol efflux. We performed a systematic review of the role of adiponectin in cholesterol efflux and HDL biogenesis, and of the proteins and receptors believed to be implicated in this process. Nineteen eligible studies (7 clinical, 11 fundamental, 1 clinical&#x202f;+&#x202f;fundamental) were identified through Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, and Pubmed, that support the notion that adiponectin plays a key role in promoting ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux and in modulating HDL biogenesis via activation of the PPAR-&#x3b3;/LXR-&#x3b1; signalling pathways in macrophages. AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 are suggested to also be implicated in this process, however the data are conflicting/insufficient to establish any firm conclusions. Once the exact mechanisms are unravelled, adiponectin may be critical in defining future treatment strategies directed towards increasing HDL functionality and ultimately reducing atherosclerotic disease.",

    "title": "Role of leptin as a biomarker for early detection of renal cell carcinoma? No evidence from a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the commonest from of renal neoplasm. Although surgery is a successful curative treatment for localized RCC, most patients are diagnosed with advanced or metastatic RCC, which has poor prognosis. RCC is classified by stage and grade using tissue samples. Whilst these provide good prognostic information, they are not very useful for early detection. Proteins that are dysregulated in patient's serum can be a valuable alternative and less invasive biomarker for early detection of the disease. For this reason, a hypothesis was formed that leptin is a possible biomarker for early detection and prognostication of RCC. The literature has disparate results on the usefulness of leptin as a biomarker for the early detection of RCC. Hence, a systematic review and a meta-analysis was carried out to investigate whether serum leptin could be a reliable diagnostic and prognostic factor in RCC patients. Literature on the available cohort and case-control studies on serum leptin in RCC was searched in electronic databases and included to evaluate this adipokine in the progression of RCC. The relevant studies were evaluated for the diagnostic and prognostic value of leptin in RCC patients. Overall, only 6 original research studies matched selection criteria and were included for meta-analysis. This study was hypothesised that; leptin might be a useful biomarker for early detection and prognostication of RCC. However, the data were presented in this study did not support our hypothesis. Serum leptin levels in RCC patients do not strongly associate with the development or progression of RCC, thus cannot act as a biomarker for early detection in RCC in patients. Extending our hypothesis further to include levels of obesity and RCC development may be worthwhile, but studies are currently limited.",

    "title": "Effect of dietary intervention, with or without co-interventions, on inflammatory markers in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a systematic literature review.",
    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a spectrum of liver disorders, ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), with inflammation acting as a key driver in its pathogenesis and progression. Diet has the potential to mediate the release of inflammatory markers; however, little is known about the effects of various diets. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effect of dietary interventions on cytokines and adipokines in patients with NAFLD. The electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library were searched for clinical trials investigating dietary interventions, with or without supplementation, on cytokines and adipokines in NAFLD patients. Basic characteristics of populations, dietary intervention protocol, cytokines, and adipokines were extracted for each study. Quality of evidence was assessed using the American Dietetic Association criteria. Nineteen studies with a total of 874 participants were included. The most frequently reported inflammatory outcomes were C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x3b1;), interleukin 6 (IL-6), adiponectin, and leptin. Hypocaloric, isocaloric, or low-fat diets significantly (P &lt; 0.05) lowered levels of CRP, TNF-&#x3b1;, and adiponectin. The addition of nutraceutical or pharmacological supplementation to dietary interventions appeared to elicit additional benefits for all of the most frequently reported inflammatory markers. Hypo- or isocaloric diets alone, or with co-interventions that included a nutraceutical or pharmacological supplementation, appear to improve the inflammatory profile in patients with NAFLD. Thus, anti-inflammatory diets may have the potential to improve underlying chronic inflammation that underpins the pathophysiological mechanisms of NAFLD. In the absence of any known liver-sensitive markers, the use of cytokines and adipokines as a surrogate marker of liver disease should be further investigated in well-controlled trials.",

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial with two parallel groups, fifty patients with NAFLD were randomized to receive daily supplementation with either two capsules of &#x3b1;-LA (each capsule containing 600 mg &#x3b1;-LA) or two placebo capsules, daily for 12 weeks. At the baseline, all participants received consultation on how to implement a healthy diet into their daily lives. Anthropometric measures, dietary intakes, liver enzymes and adipokines were assessed at the baseline and after 12 weeks of intervention. A significant reduction was observed in the serum levels of insulin (P = 0.024) and leptin (P = 0.019) in the &#x3b1;-LA group compared to the placebo group, but changes in anthropometric and body composition measures, serum glucose (FSG), resistin, irisin and liver enzymes did not differ between the groups. &#x3b1;-LA supplementation resulted in a statistically significant elevation in the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) (P = 0.033), serum levels of adiponectin (P = 0.008) and adiponectin-to-leptin ratio (P = 0.007) compared to the placebo. The liver steatosis intensity improved significantly. Nonetheless, no significant differences were observed between the study groups in the liver steatosis intensity, at the end of the study. According to the results, &#x3b1;-LA supplementation for 12 weeks improved insulin resistance, serum levels of insulin, adiponectin and leptin without changing anthropometric measures, serum liver enzymes, resistin and irisin.",

    "title": "Potential roles of chromium on inflammatory biomarkers in diabetes: A Systematic.",
    "abstract": "Diabetes, as a low-grade chronic inflammatory disease, causes disruption in proper function of immune and metabolic system. Chromium is an important element required for normal lipid and glucose metabolism. Chromium deficiency is correlated with elevation in cardiometabolic risk, which results from increased inflammation. This systematic review was conducted to discover the potential roles of chromium on&#xa0;inflammatory&#xa0;biomarkers. Eligible studies were all in vitro, animal and human studies published in English-language journals from inception until October 2018. PubMed, Scopus, Embase, ProQuest and Google Scholar databases were searched to fined interventional studies from the effects of chromium on inflammatory&#xa0;biomarkers such as tumour necrosis factor a (TNF-a), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukins, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and adipocytokines in hyperglycaemia and diabetes. Out of 647 articles found in the search, only 14 articles were eligible for analysis, three in vitro studies, eight animal studies and three human studies. Twelve of the 14 studies included in this review, chromium significantly decreased inflammatory factors. The findings of this review indicate, based on in vitro and in vivo studies, that chromium might have potential anti-inflammatory properties, but some of the studies did not show anti-inflammatory effects for chromium (two studies). There are only three studies in humans with controversial results. Therefore, more consistent randomized double-blind controlled trials are needed to reach relevant clinical recommendations, as well as to determine the precise mechanism, of chromium on inflammation in diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common chronic liver diseases worldwide. Evidence showed that anthocyanins might have effects on NAFLD. Protective effects of Cornelian cherry (Cornus mas L.) extract, as an anthocyanins-rich source, on liver were reported in animal studies. However, very few clinical trials were conducted in this regard. Thus, the aim of this research will be to evaluate the effect of supplementation with total anthocyanin-base standardized cornelian cherry fruit extract on liver function (Serum levels of Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), cytokeratin-18 fragment M30 (CK-18&#x2009;M30), as well as steatosis and fibrosis of liver), tumor necrosis factor &#x3b1; (TNF-&#x3b1;), malondealdehyde (MDA), and adiponectin in patients with NAFLD.

    "abstract": "Several studies have demonstrated the decreased insulin resistance (IR) in persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treated with glimepiride. Those suggest this might be associated with observed higher concentrations of adiponectin. We assessed if there is a difference in IR and metabolic syndrome components between glimepiride and glibenclamide treatment as well as adiponectin concentration in T2DM. Our research observed 20 T2DM patients treated with glibenclamid and 20 switched to glimepiride (n = 20) treatment for 24 weeks. Anthropometric measurements and laboratory analysis were performed at the beginning and at the end of treatment while IR was accessed by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). The glimepiride group revealed better glycaemic control compared to glibenclamide group. Moreover, the adiponectin concentration increased (23.9 &#xb1; 17.3 to 29.1 &#xb1; 12.2 ng/mL, p = 0.087) whereas it decreased in the glibenclamide group (34.3 &#xb1; 22.6 to 20.3 &#xb1; 11.3 ng/mL, p = 0.011) following 24 weeks of treatment. The serum adiponectin and HOMA-IR were inversely correlated within the group of glibenclamide (r = -0.667, p = 0.009). The present study demonstrates that glimepiride might have beneficial effect on IR compared to glibenclamide, as suggested. However, this observation needs further study investigation among other formulations of SU.",

    "title": "Effect of a 24-week weight management program on serum leptin level in correlation to anthropometric measures in obese female: A randomized controlled clinical trial.",
    "abstract": "Obesity is a major contributor to preventable disease and death across the globe. Obesity is complex. Although its risk factors are myriad and compounding, there is an urgent need for a deeper understanding of the way risk factors interact with each other. Leptin is a peptide regulates food intake and body weight. However, the notion of leptin as an anti-obesity hormone was called into question because obesity is typically associated with high leptin levels and not leptin deficiency thus, we aimed to measure leptin levels in obese female in correlation to anthropometric measures and to evaluate the impact of weight loss on its level and metabolic parameters. case-control study enrolled 40 control groups, 50 obese women. We measured anthropometric measures BMI, Waist/hip ratio (WHR). Fat mass index (FMI%) and free fat mass index (FFMI%) were assessed by dual energy X-Ray absorptiometry (DEXA) The serum levels of leptin were measured by ELISA. Our results revealed that serum leptin levels were higher in obese women compared to controls. Moreover, it was positively correlated to anthropometric measures, glycemic and lipid profile. Linear regression analysis revealed that BMI was the main independent studied parameters associated with serum leptin level among other clinical and laboratory biomarkers. Interestingly, after 12 weeks of following the Mediterranean diet (MD)-based weight loss program, serum leptin levels were decreased. Logistic regression analysis was performed to detect the main predictors' biomarkers associated with weight loss among obese women. We found that serum leptin and FMI% were an independent predictor of response with odds ratios of 1.69 and 1.64 respectively (P&#x202f;&lt;&#x202f;0.001), Receiver operating characteristic analyses revealed that the AUC of serum leptin in discriminating obese women from lean ones was 0.893 (95% CI&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.815-0.917) with sensitivity&#x202f;=&#x202f;90%, specificity&#x202f;=&#x202f;96%, and the cutoff values was 36.32&#x202f;ng/ml. Serum leptin could be a valuable diagnostic marker of obesity and its comorbidities. Moreover, significant weight loss leads to decrease serum leptin levels and improvement of glycemic and lipid profiles.",

    "abstract": "The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is recognised to reduce risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), in part, via its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which may be mediated via effects on body fat distribution. Diet efficacy via these mechanisms is however unclear in patients with diagnosed CHD. This study aimed to determine: (1) the effect of ad libitum MedDiet versus low-fat diet intervention on adiposity, anti-inflammatory marker adiponectin, oxidative stress marker malondialdehyde (MDA) and traditional CVD risk markers, and (2) whether improvement in MedDiet adherence score in the pooled cohort was associated with these risk markers, in a pilot cohort of Australian patients post coronary event. Participants (62&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;9 years, 83% male) were randomised to 6-month ad libitum MedDiet (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;34) or low-fat diet (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;31). Pre- and post-intervention, dietary adherence, anthropometry, body composition (Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry) and venepuncture measures were conducted. The MedDiet group reduced subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) area compared to the low-fat diet group (12.5&#xa0;cm<sup>2</sup> more, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.04) but not visceral adipose tissue or other body composition measures. In the pooled cohort, participants with greatest improvement in MedDiet adherence score had significantly lower waist circumference (-2.81&#xa0;cm, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.01) and SAT area (-27.1&#xa0;cm<sup>2</sup>, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.04) compared to participants with no improvement in score at 6-months. There were no changes in adiponectin, MDA or other risk markers in the MedDiet compared to low-fat diet group, and no differences in 6-month levels between categories of improvement in MedDiet score (p&#xa0;&gt;&#xa0;0.05). Within the MedDiet group only, the proportion of participants taking beta-blocker medication reduced from baseline to 6-months (71% vs. 56%, p-trend&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.007). Adherence to 6-month ad libitum MedDiet reduced subcutaneous fat and waist circumference which discounts the misconception that this healthy but high fat diet leads to body fat gain. The effect of MedDiet on body fat distribution and consequent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, as well as need for medications, in patients with CHD warrants exploration in larger studies. Clinically significant effects on these markers may require adjunct exercise and/or caloric restriction. ACTRN12616000156482.",

    "abstract": "Open vascular surgery interventions are not infrequently hampered by complication rates and durability. Preclinical surgical models show promising beneficial effects in modulating the host response to surgical injury via short-term dietary preconditioning. Here, we explore short-term protein-calorie restriction preconditioning in patients undergoing elective carotid endarterectomy to understand patient participation dynamics and practicalities of robust research approaches around nutritional/surgical interventions. We designed a pilot prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled study in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. After a 3:2 randomization to a 3-day preoperative protein-calorie restriction regimen (30% calorie/70% protein restriction) or ad libitum group, blood, clinical parameters, and stool samples were collected at baseline, pre-op, and post-op days 1 and 30. Subcutaneous and perivascular adipose tissues were harvested periprocedurally. Samples were analyzed for standard chemistries and cell counts, adipokines. Bacterial DNA isolation and 16S rRNA sequencing were performed on stool samples and the relative abundance of bacterial species was measured. Fifty-one patients were screened, 9 patients consented to the study, 5 were randomized, and 4 completed the trial. The main reason for non-consent was a 3-day in-hospital stay. All 4 participants were randomized to the protein-calorie restriction group, underwent successful endarterectomy, reported no compliance difficulties, nor were there adverse events. Stool analysis trended toward increased abundance of the sulfide-producing bacterial species Bilophila wadsworthia after dietary intervention (P = .08). Although carotid endarterectomy patients held low enthusiasm for a 3-day preoperative inpatient stay, there were no adverse effects in this small cohort. Multidisciplinary longitudinal research processes were successfully executed throughout the nutritional/surgical intervention. Future translational endeavors into dietary preconditioning of vascular surgery patients should focus on outpatient approaches.",

    "abstract": "Obesity has been proposed as a risk factor for prostate cancer (PCa). In obesity, serum levels of the appetite-regulating hormones-leptin, adiponectin, and ghrelin-become deregulated. To explore whether serum levels of appetite-regulating hormones associate with the incidence of PCa, the incidence of advanced disease, or PCa-specific mortality. PRISMA guidelines were followed. A systematic search for relevant articles published until March 2019 was performed using the databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science. Observational studies with data on serum levels of leptin, adiponectin, or ghrelin and PCa outcome were included. Meta-analysis was used to combine risk estimates. Meta-relative risks (mRRs) were calculated using random effects models. When available, raw data was pooled. Publication bias was assessed by funnel plot and Begg's test. Thirty-five studies were eligible for inclusion. The qualitative analysis indicated that leptin was not consistently associated with any PCa outcome, although several cohorts reported decreased adiponectin levels in men who later developed advanced PCa. Based on the meta-analysis, there was no significant effect of leptin on PCa incidence (mRR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.93 (95% CI 0.75-1.16), p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.52) or advanced PCa (mRR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.90 (95% CI 0.74-1.10), p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.30). There were insufficient studies to estimate the mRR of PCa incidence for men with the highest levels of adiponectin.

    "abstract": "Dehydration in rodents induces anorexia. In humans however, the role of dehydration in energy intake is controversial. This study investigated the effect of extreme fluid restriction on acute energy intake during and after exercise-induced dehydration. Eight physically active participants performed two exercise sessions to induce dehydration. After the exercise, the men were allowed to either rehydrate for 2 h or were maintained in a hypohydrated state, in a randomized manner. After 2 h, they were given cereal bars ad libitum for 1 h. Blood and saliva samples of the participants were collected before the exercise session, after the exercise session, after rehydration, and after the meal. Post-exercise energy intake differed between hypohydrated (1430 &#xb1; 210 kcal) and rehydrated (2190 &#xb1; 780 kcal) trials (p = 0.01). For the concentrations of ghrelin and leptin, there were no significant effects of time (p = 0.94, p = 0.21), between trials (p = 0.09, p = 0.99), or due to a trial-time interaction (p = 0.64, p = 0.68), respectively. The concentrations of peptide YY (PYY) were not different between trials (p = 0.94) but there was a significant effect of time (p = 0.0001) and a trial-time interaction (p = 0.01), with higher levels in the rehydration trial after eating in response to a higher energy intake. For saliva production, there was a significant effect of time (p = 0.02) and a trial-time interaction (p = 0.04), but no between-trial effect (p = 0.08). In conclusion, extreme fluid restriction decreased acute food intake after exercise, which may be explained by a lower flow of saliva.",

    "abstract": "Overweight increases the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and serves as a major risk factor for arthropathy and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). This condition is becoming increasingly prevalent among patients with haemophilia (PWH). Different forms of exercise training could favourably modify weight-related complications, cardiovascular risk factors and the inflammation. To investigate the effects of resistance, aerobic and combined exercises on the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers in overweight patients with moderate haemophilia A. Forty-eight patients with moderate haemophilia A, aged 35-55&#xa0;years, and body mass index (BMI) of 25-30&#xa0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> were randomly assigned to resistance training (RT, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;12), aerobic (AT, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;12), combined training (CT, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;12) and control (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;12) groups. The patients participated in 45-minutes exercise sessions three times a week for 6&#xa0;weeks. Waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), fat mass, fat-free mass, interleukin-10 (IL-10), adiponectin, tumour necrosis factor-&#x3b1; (TNF-&#x3b1;), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were measured before and after the 6&#xa0;weeks of training. There was significant decrease in WC, WHR, BMI and weight in the AT, RT and CT groups as compared to the control group. Total HJHS scores decreased in the AT, RT, CT groups compared to the control groups (P&#xa0;&#x2264;&#xa0;0.001). The decrease in hs-CRP, IL-6 and TNF-&#x3b1; in the CT group was significant compared to the control group (P&#xa0;&#x2264;&#xa0;0.02). The increase in IL-10 and adiponectin was not significant in the RT, AT and CT groups compared to the control group. CT was the most effective training mode for decreasing the pro-inflammatory cytokines and increasing anti-inflammatory markers in overweight patients with haemophilia A.",

    "abstract": "Though most of the observational studies have shown that metformin can reduce serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level in patients of hypothyroidism with diabetes or polycystic ovarian disease, randomised controlled trials are sparse. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of metformin on thyroid function tests (TSH, free T4, and free T3) in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH). In this open label, parallel arm, randomised controlled trial, 60 patients of SCH (TSH 5.5-10&#xa0;mIU/L) were randomised to either metformin group (1500&#xa0;mg/day) or control group. A total of 46 patients (23 in each group) completed the study and no significant difference in serum TSH, free T4 or free T3 was found in between the 2 groups. Neither there was any significant change in serum TSH, free T4 or free T3 (pre and post 6&#xa0;months) within the individual groups. However, the rate of normalisation of serum TSH in patients with negative thyroid antibody was significantly higher than patients with positive thyroid antibody (71.4% vs. 18.8%; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.026) in metformin group in post hoc analysis. Fasting plasma glucose, serum high-density lipoprotein and indices of insulin sensitivity significantly improved in metformin group. Four patients (17%) had mild gastrointestinal adverse effects in the metformin group. We did not find any significant change in thyroid function test in patients with SCH with metformin therapy.",

    "abstract": "The Framingham Stroke Risk Profile (FSRP) is a validated model for predicting 10-year ischemic stroke risk in middle-aged adults, yet has not been demonstrated to consistently translate in older populations. This is a systematic review of independent risk factors measured among <u>&gt;</u> 65 year olds, with subsequent first ischemic stroke, using PRISMA guidelines. We appraised peer-reviewed publications that included participants <u>&gt;</u> 65 years old at risk assessment. Combined with other criteria, results were abstracted from 28 papers reporting six types of stroke risk factors: Serologic/Diagnostic, Conventional, Psychosocial, Genetic, Cognitive, and Antibiotic use. These studies demonstrated levels of serum androgens, C-reactive protein, and advanced glycation endproducts; thrombin generation; left ventricular mass; depressive symptoms; phosphodiesterase 4D single nucleotide polymorphisms; coagulation factor XII gene; peak thrombus generation; and lower cognitive functioning were independent risk factors for ischemic stroke in older adults. Plasma adipokines, free fatty acids and antibiotic use did not predict ischemic stroke. Purpose in life and APOE&#x3b5;2 allele were protective for ischemic stroke. This systematic review provides evidence of risk and protective factors for ischemic stroke in older cohorts that are not included in the FSRP. Further studies are needed to understand whether these factors are important enough to comprise a risk score.",

    "abstract": "Background: Some pilot studies already tried to investigate potential associations of leptin (LEP) and LEP receptor (LEPR) variants with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the results of these studies were not consistent. Thus, we performed the present meta-analysis to explore associations between LEP/LEPR variants and CAD in a larger pooled population.Methods: Systematic literature research of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and CNKI was performed to identify eligible case-control studies on associations between LEP/LEPR variants and CAD. The initial search was conducted in September 2018 and the latest update was performed in December 2018. Q test and I<sup>2</sup> statistic were employed to assess between-study heterogeneities. If probability value(P-value) of Q test was less than 0.1 or I<sup>2</sup> was greater than 50%, random-effect models (REMs) would be used to pool the data. Otherwise, fixed-effect models (FEMs) would be applied for synthetic analyses.Results: A total of ten studies published between 2006 and 2018 were eligible for analyses (1989 cases and 2601 controls). Pooled analyses suggested that LEP rs7799039 variant was significantly associated with CAD under over-dominant model (P=0.0007, odds ratio (OR) = 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14-1.63, I<sup>2</sup> = 41%, FEM) in overall population, and this significant finding was further confirmed in East Asians in subsequent subgroup analyses. However, no positive findings were observed for LEPR rs1137100 and rs1137101 variants in overall and subgroup analyses.Conclusions: Our meta-analysis suggested that LEP rs7799039 variant might affect individual susceptibility to CAD.",

    "abstract": "Background: Adiponectin has been suggested as a marker of many cardiovascular diseases. However, the association between serum adiponectin and incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in general population remains unclear. A meta-analysis was performed to systematically evaluate the potential influence of serum adiponectin at baseline on the incidence of AF during follow-up in general population.Methods: Prospective cohort studies were identified via electronic search of PubMed and Embase databases. A randomized effect model was applied to combine the results. Predefined subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate the influence of study characteristics on the association between baseline adiponectin and risk of new-onset AF.Results: Six cohort studies with 18558 community-derived participants were included, and 3165 AF cases were developed with a mean follow-up duration of up to 22 years.

    "abstract": "Adipose tissue-derived adipokines are pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in metabolic-related diseases and can be influenced by diet and exercise. We aimed to compare the effect of a Mediterranean (MdM) compared with Fast Food (FFM) meal on the exercise induced adipokines changes. In a double blinded cross over trial, 46 participants were randomly assigned to one of two standardized iso-energy pre-exercise meals: FFM or MdM-type. Three hours after each meal, participants completed a treadmill exercise test (EC). Serum adiponectin, resistin, PAI-1, lipocalin-2/NGAL and adipsin were determined by Luminex magnetic bead immunoassay. Wilcoxon signed rank test compared changes before/after meal and before/after EC and a linear mixed model evaluated the effect of meals on the adipokine response to exercise, adjusted for confounders. Thirty-nine participants (mean age of 25, with a standard deviation of 5 years) completed the trial (56% females). For both interventions, a significant reduction of adipsin after each meal and a significant increase of lipocalin, PAI-1, adipsin and resistin, after exercise was observed. When exercise was preceded by a MdM meal a higher increase in adipsin levels was seen. Acute exercise induced an increase of circulatory levels of adipsin, resistin, lipocalin and PAI-1, but not adiponectin. A pre-exercise Mediterranean meal potentiated the increase of adipsin after the exercise test, which possibly relates to the immune regulatory role of adipsin. These changes suggest a cross-talk between the immune and metabolic immediate response to exercise and its modulation by the pre-exercise diet composition.",

    "abstract": "Including carbohydrate/fructose-rich foods (predominantly fruit) in the diets of overweight individuals can improve chronic disease risk factors. We hypothesized dried plums (DP) would improve nutrient consumption, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), lipid and adipokine profiles, and would decrease adiposity and inflammation. To test this, we studied the effects of 8-weeks of twice-daily snacking of macronutrient-matched 100kcal servings of DP or refined carbohydrate-rich snack (low-fat muffins: LFM) on daily energy and nutrient consumption, and chronic disease risk factors in overweight adults. Body weight/composition, waist circumference, blood pressure, plasma glucose, insulin, c-peptide, lipids, TAC, adipokines and inflammation were measured at baseline and throughout the study. Postprandial glucose and insulin were assessed following assigned test foods at baseline and 8-weeks. Repeated measures ANOVAs were undertaken to examine group and time differences. Post-hoc independent and paired samples t-tests were conducted where necessary. DP increased (P&lt;.05) overall intake of dietary fiber and potassium, and TAC, from baseline to 8-weeks. Baseline postprandial glycemia tended (P=.09) to be lower with DP versus LFM, while both groups had a decreased response after 8-weeks. Postprandial insulinemia was lower (P&lt;.05) for DP at both time-points. No differences in body weight/composition, blood pressure, or fasting glucose, insulin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-C, inflammation or adipokines were detected. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) increased (P&lt;.05) throughout the trial following LFM. Overall, DP lessened postprandial insulinemia, improved nutrient consumption and plasma TAC, and maintained plasma LDL-C compared to a macronutrient-matched refined carbohydrate snack, which could decrease chronic disease risk.",

    "title": "The epicardial adipose tissue and the coronary arteries: dangerous liaisons.",
    "abstract": "The adipose tissue (AT) is an endocrine organ that produces adipocytokines (adipokines), able to influence metabolic homeostasis. In the conventional classification, there are two large AT depots, characterized by different paracrine activities: the subcutaneous AT, which would mostly produce cytokines with protective properties against cardiovascular disease; and the visceral AT, responsible for the secretion of cytokines with proinflammatory, prothrombotic, and proatherogenic effects. A third component, the epicardial AT (EAT) is now receiving increasing attention due to its unique anatomical and functional proximity to the myocardium and the coronary arteries. In rodents, the EAT protects the heart from exposure to high levels of free fatty acids, and provides energy to the myocardium under high metabolic demands. The observation that atherosclerotic plaques are more prevalent in regions of coronary arteries surrounded by the EAT, while they tend to be less present in segments penetrating the myocardium (the septal branches and segments under myocardial bridges), has led to the hypothesis of a possible role of the EAT in promoting the development of atherosclerosis through endocrine and paracrine effects, in addition to the role of biomechanical forces affecting transendothelial lipid permeability into the intima. In this article, we review the clinical and molecular evidence linking the EAT and coronary artery disease through a systematic review of the literature. We, here, discuss current diagnostic techniques in evaluating the interaction between EAT and the onset of coronary artery disease and ischaemic heart disease. Finally, we review current knowledge on the underlying mechanisms by which the EAT may affect coronary atherosclerosis, and potential clinical implications of this interaction, making the EAT an attractive target for new therapeutics in cardiovascular disease.",

Further subgroup analyses by ethnicity showed that rs1501299 polymorphism was significantly associated with the susceptibility to CAD in East Asians, whereas rs2241766 polymorphism was significantly associated with the susceptibility to CAD in Caucasians, East Asians and South Asians. Our findings indicated that rs1501299 and rs2241766 polymorphisms both affect the susceptibility to CAD in certain populations.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common and important metabolic diseases in human. Curcumin, which is a natural polyphenol found in turmeric, can be used in treatment of diabetes complications for its antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. In this double-blind randomized clinical trial, 44 patients with Type 2 diabetes randomly assigned to curcumin or placebo group. Patients consumed either 1,500-mg curcumin or placebo daily for 10&#xa0;weeks. Anthropometric measurements were measured at baseline and at the end of the study. Serum concentrations of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and adiponectin were determined after 12-hr fasting at the beginning and end of study. The mean serum level of TG decreased in curcumin group compared with baseline (109&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;36 vs. 124&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;36; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05). At the end of study, the mean concentration of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein decreased in the curcumin group compared to the control (2.9&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;2.9 vs. 3.4&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;4.2; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05). The mean serum concentration of adiponectin increased (64&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;3 vs. 63&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;4; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05) in the treatment group compared with the placebo at the end of the study. The results of the current study indicate that curcumin consumption may reduce diabetes complications through decreasing TG level as well as indicators of inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has become one of the leading causes of liver disease in the western world. In obese patients weight reduction is recommended. Up to now there are no specific guidelines for weight loss in order to reduce hepatic fat content. To investigate the effects of a 24-wk guided lifestyle intervention program compared to a meal replacement regimen based on soy protein. Twenty-six subjects with NASH participated in a randomized single-center study. They were randomly assigned to either meal replacement group (MR-G) with soy-yogurt-honey preparation or to guided lifestyle change group (LC-G) with endurance activity and nutrition counselling. Serum alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), lipid parameters, and adipokines were measured. Liver fat content and lipid composition were determined by magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Body fat mass and lean body mass were assessed using Bod Pod<sup>&#xae;</sup> device. Pre- and post-intervention monitoring of parameters was performed. Statistical analyses were conducted with SPSS software, results were expressed as median (interquartile range). Twenty-two subjects (MR-G, n = 11 and LC-G, n = 11) completed the study (9 women, 13 men; age 52.1 (15.0) years, body mass index (BMI) 32.3 (3.3) kg/m&#xb2;). In both groups a significant weight loss was achieved (MR-G: -6.4 (3.6) kg, P &lt; 0.01; LC-G: -9.1 (10.4) kg, P &lt; 0.01). BMI dropped in both groups (MR-G: -2.3 (1.5) kg/m<sup>2</sup>, P = 0.003; LC-G: -3.0 (3.4) kg/m<sup>2</sup>, P = 0.006). Internal fat and hepatic lipid content were markedly reduced in both groups in comparable amount. There was a strong correlation between reduction in liver fat and decrease in ALT. Likewise, both groups showed an improvement in glycemic control and lipid profile. Changes in adipokines, particularly in adiponectin and leptin were closely related to intrahepatic lipid changes. Comprehensive lifestyle intervention and meal replacement regimen have comparable effects on body and liver fat, as well as decrease in markers of hepatic inflammation among NASH patients.",

    "abstract": "Promoter plays important roles in regulating transcription of genes. Association studies of genetic variants in promoter region with type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk have been reported, but most were limited to small number of individual genetic variants and insufficient sample sizes. In addition, the effect of study populations and demographic characteristics were often neglected. In this study, we conducted a large-scale meta-analysis and subgroup analysis of T2D associated genetic variants in the promoter regions to evaluate their contribution to the susceptibility in T2D. Alleles and genotypes from cohort or case-controlled studies were extracted for future study. Total 41 742 cases and 50 493 controls for three loci were involved in 70 articles. Seventy case-controlled studies of three genes with 41 742 cases and 50 493 controls were included. Meta-analysis showed only rs266729 and rs17300539 of ADIPOQ, and rs1884613, rs2144908, and rs4810424 of HNF4A were significantly associated with T2D risk. Subgroup analysis showed that both rs266729 and rs17300539 of ADIPOQ were associated with the risk of T2D in Caucasian population, but only rs266729 of ADIPOQ in Asian population and rs2144908 in other population including multinational North American. For diagnostic criteria, rs266729 of ADIPOQ and rs2144908 of HNF4A were associated with T2D risk when WHO/ADA diagnostic criteria were used. For genotyping methods, both rs266729 of ADIPOQ and rs2144908 of HNF4A were associated with T2D risk when other than Taqman and Sequencing methods were used. T2D was significantly associated with promoter rs266729, rs17300539, rs1884613, rs2144908, and rs4810424, and the association of T2D risk were affected by study population, diagnostic criteria, and genotype methods.",

    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a significant contributor to global hepatic disorders. ADIPOQ gene single-nucleotide polymorphisms have been associated with NAFLD susceptibility, but with inconsistent results across the studies. This study aimed to investigate the association between ADIPOQ polymorphisms (+276G&gt;T, rs1501299 and -11377C&gt;G, rs266729) and the risk of NAFLD. PubMed, Embase, Wanfang, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases were used to identify the relevant published literature. Statistical analyses were calculated with STATA 11.0 software and RevMan 5.2. Summary odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were generated to assess the strength of the associations. Eleven relevant articles with a total of 3,644 participants (1,847 cases/1,797 controls) were included. Our meta-analysis results revealed that ADIPOQ gene +276G&gt;T polymorphism was not associated with NAFLD under various genetic models (allele model: OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.99, 95% CI [0.69, 1.41]; dominant model: OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.06, 95% CI [0.71, 1.58]; recessive model: OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.83, 95% CI [0.42, 1.65]; homozygous model: OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.86, 95% CI [0.38, 1.95]; heterozygous model: OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.10, 95% CI [0.80, 1.53]; respectively). Moreover, no statistical significant association was found between +276G&gt;T and NAFLD risk in the subgroups. ADIPOQ gene -11377C&gt;G polymorphism significantly increased the risk of NAFLD (allele model: OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.49, 95% CI [1.28, 1.75]; dominant model: OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.64, 95% CI [1.35, 1.99]; recessive model: OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.77, 95% CI [1.16, 2.70]; homozygous model: OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;2.13, 95% CI [1.38, 3.28]; heterozygous model: OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.58, 95% CI [1.29, 1.93]; respectively). ADIPOQ gene -11377C&gt;G may be a risk factor for NAFLD, while there was no association between ADIPOQ gene +276G&gt;T polymorphism and the risk of NAFLD. Further studies are needed to detect the relationship between these ADIPOQ polymorphisms and NAFLD.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to examine whether adding biomarkers to routine clinical parameters improves prediction of radiographic spinal progression in axial spondyloarthritis. One hundred and seventeen patients with ankylosing spondylitis who completed the Effects of NSAIDs on RAdiographic Damage in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ENRADAS) trial were included. Radiographic spinal progression was defined as worsening of the modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spine Score by &#x2a7e;2 points after 2 years. A clinical prediction model was constructed out of baseline syndesmophytes, elevated CRP, cigarette smoking and male sex. The following serum biomarkers were measured at baseline by ELISA: MMP3, VEGF, calprotectin, leptin, high molecular weight adiponectin, osteoprotegerin, sclerostin, N-terminal telopeptide, procollagen type II N-terminal propeptide and serum amyloid A. Repeated cross-validation analyses revealed one biomarker combination with potential added predictive value in addition to the clinical model: leptin + high molecular weight adiponectin + VEGF. This biomarker combination showed an area under the curve (AUC)Biomarkers = 0.731 (95% CI: 0.614, 0.848), which was numerically superior to the clinical model [AUCClinical = 0.665 (95% CI: 0.553, 0.776)]. A combination of clinical parameters + biomarkers showed an improved predictive value compared with the clinical model reflected by AUCClinical+Biomarkers = 0.768 (95% CI: 0.666, 0.871), though not statistically significant (P = 0.051). However, by considering the part of the receiver operating characteristic curve with a specificity &#x2a7e;75% resulting in partial AUC (pAUC), the improvement becomes significant (pAUCClinical+Biomarkers = 0.119; pAUCClinical = 0.053; P = 0.01). Biomarkers show potential to improve the prediction of radiographic spinal progression in axial spondyloarthritis when used in addition to the clinical parameters, though the added value seems to be rather small.",

    "abstract": "Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with high prevalence rates of obesity-related conditions and subclinical inflammation. Adiponectin is produced by adipose tissue and exerts anti-inflammatory activities. We aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies investigating adiponectin levels in BD patients and healthy controls. Electronic databases were searched from their inception until 15th Jan 2019. Random-effects models with the Hedges' g as the effect size (ES) estimate were used. We included 11 studies, representing 477 patients and 380 controls. Pooled data analysis revealed no significant differences in adiponectin levels between BD patients and controls (ES&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.28, 95%CI: -0.34 - 0.90, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.372).

Due to low number of studies, the subgroup analysis of manic patients was not performed; however, a severity of manic symptoms was not associated with the ES estimates. Longer illness duration and a higher percentage of BD type I (BD-I) patients were associated with higher ES estimates. A higher severity of depressive symptoms was associated with lower ES estimates. Heterogeneity was significant in all analyses. Results of the Egger's test were insignificant, showing no publication bias. Our results indicate that adiponectin might be a state marker of BD as it appears to be elevated in euthymia and decreased in depression. Illness progression and a diagnosis of BD-I might contribute to higher adiponectin levels.",

Using systematic reviews and meta-analyses and standardized mean difference as effect size, the levels of three adipokines, leptin, adiponectin and resistin, have been investigated in migraineur subjects in the case-control studies. Using random-effects models, the final analyses demonstrated the standardized mean differences of leptin, adiponectin and resistin as 0.534 (95% confidence interval, 0.169-0.898), 0.439 (95% confidence interval, 0.132-0.746) and 0.194 (95% confidence interval, -0.158-0.546), respectively.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Metabolic related nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most prevalent chronic liver diseases around the world. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1501299 (+276G&gt;T) in the adiponectin gene has been recently revealed to be responsible for susceptibility to NAFLD. This meta-analysis intended to assess the association risk of NAFLD and rs1501299 polymorphism. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a literature search on PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. All involved studies were selected based on our search criteria. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to quantify the strength of the association. Subgroup analysis considered the effects of ethnicity, subject scope, and source of control. Publication bias was assessed by Begg's tests. RESULTS Eight qualified case-control studies with 1639 patients and 1426 controls demonstrated a significant correlation between rs1501299 polymorphism in adiponectin and NAFLD under the dominant model (OR=1.18, 95% CI=1.02-1.36), allelic contrast (OR=1.21, 95% CI=1.09-1.36), homozygote comparison (OR=1.63, 95% CI=1.26-2.01) and the recessive allele model (OR=1.58, 95% CI=1.23-2.02) with evident heterogeneity. No association was observed between the risk of NAFLD and the genotypic variants in heterozygote comparison (OR=1.11, 95% CI=0.95-1.29) without heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis suggested that the sample size could be the potential source of heterogeneity. Source of control was not the reason for between-study heterogeneity and further sensitivity analysis and publication bias revealed good consistency and symmetry in the pooling studies. CONCLUSIONS Results from our current meta-analysis gave insight into the correlation between rs1501299 polymorphism and the risk of NAFLD, indicating the variant of rs1501299 might be related to increased NAFLD susceptibility.",

In 298 patients from the Swedish Pharmacotherapy (SWEFOT) clinical trial, baseline serum levels of 12 proteins were analyzed for association with disease activity based on the 28-joint count Disease Activity Score (DAS28) after 3 months of MTX monotherapy using uni-/multivariate logistic regression. Primary outcome was low disease activity (LDA; DAS28 &#x2264; 3.2). Of 298 patients, 104 achieved LDA after 3 months on MTX. Four of the 12 biomarkers [C-reactive protein (CRP), leptin, tumor necrosis factor receptor I (TNF-RI), and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1)] significantly predicted LDA based on stepwise logistic regression analysis. Dichotomization of patients using receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis-based cutoffs for these biomarkers showed significantly higher proportions with LDA among patients with lower versus higher levels of CRP or leptin (40% vs 23%, p = 0.004, and 40% vs 25%, p = 0.011, respectively), as well as among those with higher versus lower levels of TNF-RI or VCAM-1 (43% vs 27%, p = 0.004, and 41% vs 25%, p = 0.004, respectively). Combined score based on these biomarkers, adjusted for known predictors of LDA (smoking, sex, and age), associated with decreased chance of LDA (adjusted OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.32-0.62). Low baseline levels of CRP and leptin, and high baseline levels of TNF-RI and VCAM-1 were associated with LDA after 3 months of MTX therapy in patients with eRA. Combination of these 4 biomarkers increased accuracy of prediction. [Trial registration number: NCT00764725].",

    "title": "Association of serum leptin with breast cancer: A meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that leptin is associated to the tumorigenesis and progression of breast cancer (BC). However, these studies remain inconsistent. Thus, a meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the role of leptin in the patients with BC. A systematic search in PubMed, Embase, ISI Web of Science, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases was conducted up to September 1, 2017. The standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was applied to pool the effect size. A funnel plot and Egger test were used to evaluate publication bias. Finally, 43 eligible studies were included in the current meta-analysis. Overall, serum leptin levels in BC cases were significantly higher compared with the controls (SMD = 0.61, P&#x200a;&lt;.0001). When subgroup analyses were restricted to ethnicity and menstrual status, higher serum leptin concentration was also detected in patients with BC. Moreover, BC cases with body mass index (BMI) &gt;25 indicated significantly higher serum leptin levels (SMD = 1.48, P = .034). Furthermore, the BC cases with lymph node metastases showed significantly higher serum leptin concentration (SMD = 0.53, P&#x200a;=&#x200a;.015). The present meta-analysis suggests that the serum leptin may profiles as a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and metastasis of BC. In addition, leptin will provide useful information for a therapeutic target to treat BC.",

    "abstract": "The risk for obesity-related diseases increases with the prevalence of obesity. In obesity, adipokines secreted from adipose tissue induce inflammation, causing adverse effects. Recently, adipokines such as apelin, visfatin, and chemerin have been studied. Long-term resistance training improves health in middle-aged women by improving metabolic risk factors, body composition, and muscle strength. However, there is still a lack of evidence on the association of apelin concentration with different exercise types in middle-aged obese women This study aimed to investigate the effects of 8&#x2009;weeks of aerobic and resistance exercises on apelin-12 and apelin-36 levels and thereby verify the effects of different exercise types in obese, middle-aged women. Participants were middle-aged women aged 50-61&#x2009;years, with no experience of systematic exercise in the last 6&#x2009;months, and met the WHO obesity criteria for the Asia-Pacific region of waist circumference&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;80&#x2009;cm and body fat percentage&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;30%. Subjects were selected and allocated to the aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, or no exercise group by block randomization. Body weight, body fat, and body mass index were measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Analysis of variance, the t-test, and Tukey's post-hoc test were performed. A total of 24 participants were selected with eight participants in each group. Both aerobic and resistance exercises were effective in altering the physical composition, showing significant decreases in weight, waist circumference, BMI, and body fat. The aerobic and resistance exercise group showed a significant, positive change in apelin-12 levels. In obese individuals, aerobic and resistance exercise were effective in improving obesity and reducing blood apelin-12 concentration, which is closely correlated with indicators of metabolic syndrome. Future research should focus on comparing the response of apelin to exercise in obese subjects treated with only dietary control and the response in the obese subjects of different ages and sex.

Randomised Clinical Trial. This is the body composition substudy of NEAT 001/ANRS 143, a randomised trial comparing darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) plus either raltegravir (RAL) or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) in 805 ART na&#xef;ve HIV-infected adults. The primary endpoint was percentage change in limb fat at week 96. Secondary endpoints were associations among these changes and metabolic markers (IL-6, insulin, leptin, adiponectin, FGF-23). 126 subjects (61 DRV/r + RAL and 65 DRV/r + TDF/FTC) were included. The rate of change in BMI between groups for RAL versus TDF/FTC at week 96 was 1.5% per 48-week period (p = 0.015). The rate of change in limb fat mass, trunk fat mass, total body fat and total lean mass was for RAL versus TDF/FTC at week 96 was 2.5% (p = 0.38), 7.3% ((p = 0.021), 4.9% (p = 0.061) and 1.3% (p = 0.12) respectively. Baseline insulin and leptin levels were correlated with baseline limb fat and trunk fat mass [r = 0.31 (p = 0.0043)/r = 0.28 (p = 0.0011) for limb fat, and r = 0.63 (p&lt;0.0001)/r = 0.50(p&lt;0.0001) for trunk fat]. After adjustment, a 10% faster increase in leptin between baseline and week 48 was associated with a more rapid increase in limb fat at week 48 (0.5% per 48 weeks, p&lt;0.001), total body fat mass (0.6% per 48 weeks, p&lt;0.001), and trunk fat mass (0.3% per 48 weeks, p = 0.0026).

    "title": "Association between serum/plasma levels of adiponectin and obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome: a meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "The relationship between obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) and a variety of disease from obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease has been investigated previously. Reduced adiponectin levels are also associated with increased risk of these disease. However, whether serum/plasma adiponectin levels in OSAHS patients are lower than their counterparts remain controversial. Therefore, this study evaluated the association between serum/plasma adiponectin levels and OSAHS. We performed a comprehensive literature search to locate eligible articles published on electronic databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, WANFANG (Chinese database), VIP (Chinese Database) and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). Pooled standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated as effect size. Heterogeneity test was performed by Cochrane Q test and I<sup>2</sup> test. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression analysis were employed to detect the sources of the heterogeneity. RevMan 5.3 and Stata 12.0 software were used in this meta-analysis for data synthesis. A total of 20 eligible studies with 28 databases involving 1356 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Results revealed that serum/plasma adiponectin levels in OSAHS patients were significantly lower than that in controls [SMD&#x2009;=&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.71, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.92 to -&#x2009;0.49, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001]. Subgroup analysis indicated that the heterogeneity would decreased when subgroup analysis was stratified by race. In addition, meta-regression analysis also suggested that the adiponectin levels were only significantly correlated with race. The removal of any independent study did not affect the pooled SMD in the sensitivity analysis. The serum/plasma adiponectin levels were significantly lower in OSAHS patients than that in control subjects, suggesting a possible role of adiponectin in OSAHS pathogenesis, deserves further studies as a potential marker of OSAHS.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the intake of yerba mate (YM) and green tea (GT) on serum levels of leptin and paraoxonase-1 (PON-1), compared to control. Controlled, randomized clinical trial (RCT) that evaluated 142 men and women affected by overweight or obesity aged 35-60&#x2009;years, untreated dyslipidemia and no history of coronary artery disease. Participants were randomized to ingest 1000&#x2009;mL GT, YM or apple tea (AT, control group) daily, during eight weeks. Serum PON-1 and leptin levels were analyzed by ELISA immunoassay at the beginning (baseline) and after eight weeks of intervention. The intake of 1&#x2009;l of YM/day resulted in significant increase in serum levels of PON-1 (9.7%; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005). The consumption of GT induced no significant difference in the levels of PON-1 (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.154) and leptin (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.783). Intergroup analysis showed a significant difference (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.036) in the variation of PON-1 levels in the YM group when compared to GT and AT groups. In addition, the increase in PON-1 levels in the YM group was significantly associated with increased HDL-c (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004). The intake of yerba mate increased the antioxidant capacity by increasing serum levels of PON-1 and was positively associated with increased HDL-c, stressing the protective role of this beverage against atherosclerotic diseases.

    "abstract": "Chronodisruption, as caused by such conditions as perturbations of 24-hour rhythms of physiology and behavior, may promote the development of metabolic diseases. To assess the acute effects of sleep curtailment on circadian regulation (i.e., morning-to-evening differences) of white adipose tissue (WAT) transcriptome in normal-weight men. Fifteen healthy men aged 18 to 30 years (mean &#xb1; SEM, 24.0 &#xb1; 0.9years) were studied. In randomized, balanced order they underwent three separate nights with regular sleep duration (8 hours of sleep between 11:00 pm and 7:00 am), sleep restriction (4 hours of sleep between 3:00 am and 7:00 am), and sleep deprivation (no sleep at all). Sleep was polysomnographically evaluated. WAT biopsy samples were taken twice at 9:00 pm and 7:00 am to assess morning-to-evening differences. WAT transcriptome profile was assessed by RNA sequencing, and expression of relevant circadian core clock genes were analyzed. Glucose homeostasis, lipid profile, and adipokines were assessed. Sleep restriction dramatically blunted morning-to-evening transcriptome variations with further dampening after sleep deprivation. Although most core clock genes remained stably rhythmic, morning-to-evening regulated pathways of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism were highly sensitive to sleep loss. In particular, genes associated with carbohydrate breakdown lost rhythmicity after sleep deprivation, with an overall trend toward an upregulation in the morning. In line with specific transcriptional changes in WAT, retinol-binding-protein 4 was increased and &#x3b2;-cell secretory capacity was diminished. Acute sleep loss induces a profound restructuring of morning-to-evening WAT transcriptome with uncoupling from the local clock machinery, resulting in increased WAT carbohydrate turnover and impaired glucose homeostasis. Our data support an optimization of sleep duration and timing to prevent metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Obesity in adolescents is considered a major public health problem; combined interventional approaches such as omega-3 supplementation with lifestyle intervention (LI) might exert synergistic effects and exceed the impact of each individual strategy. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate if the supplementation of omega-3 with LI could improve metabolic and endothelial abnormality in obese adolescents with hypertriglyceridemia. The study involved sixty-nine adolescents with normal weight and seventy obese adolescents with hypertriglyceridemia. All obese adolescents were applied to LI and randomly assigned to omega-3 supplementation or placebo group for 12 weeks. The obese adolescents with hypertriglyceridemia presented increased levels of leptin, retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4), selectin E (sE) and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and decreased levels of adiponectin compared with control subjects. After 12-week intervention, omega-3 supplementation with LI decreased significantly in triglycerides, HOMA, leptin, RBP4, ADMA and sE. Moreover, omega-3 with LI displayed a significant reduction in triglycerides, ADMA and sE in comparison with LI alone. In subjects with omega-3 combined with LI assessed by multivariate regression model, the reduction in triglycerides was the only independent determinant of the decrease in ADMA. The reductions in triglycerides and HOMA were significantly contributed to the changes in sE. Our data indicated that omega-3 combined with LI in short duration significantly improved dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, abnormality of adipokines, endothelial dysfunction in comparison of LI alone, indicating the combined approach is an effective clinical and applicable strategy to control metabolic abnormality and decrease the risks of cardiovascular diseases in obese adolescents.",

    "title": "Resistin is a prognostic factor for death in type 2 diabetes.",
    "abstract": "To investigate the association of leptin, resistin, and tumour necrosis factor &#x3b1; (TNF-&#x3b1;) with prognosis in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Analysis included 284 T2D patients. Apart from routine laboratory parameters, baseline leptin, resistin, and TNF-&#x3b1; concentrations were measured. Patients were followed for a median of 5.4&#xa0;years. The primary endpoint was all-cause death at follow-up. The secondary endpoint was a composite of death, acute coronary syndrome, and stroke or transient ischemic attack. At baseline, median age was 68&#xa0;years, and 48% of patients were female. Data on the primary endpoint were obtained for all patients: 32 (11%) died during follow-up. Data on the secondary endpoint were available for 230 patients, of whom 45 (20%) reached the secondary endpoint. In univariate analyses, older age, heart failure, lower-glomerular filtration rate, and higher resistin, TNF-&#x3b1; and NT-proBNP concentrations were predictors of the study endpoints. Of these variables, only resistin remained an independent predictor of both study endpoints in multivariate models. In receiver-operating characteristic analysis, area under the curve for resistin was 0.7. Resistin concentration of greater than or equal to 11.4&#xa0;ng/mL had sensitivity of 41% and specificity of 91% for prediction of death at follow-up (Youden's index). Higher resistin is associated with reduced survival in T2D, irrespectively of TNF-&#x3b1;. Resistin concentration of above 11&#xa0;ng/mL indicates T2D patients at an increased risk of unfavourable outcomes. Leptin was not a prognostic factor. These results suggest that in T2D, association of resistin with unfavourable outcomes might, at least in part, result from its pro-inflammatory properties.",

    "abstract": "Considering conflicting results on the consequences of all types of obesity surgery, we were to summarize them via a systematic review. Electronic literature search was done via scientific search engines. After the removal of duplicates and selection of articles of interest, 771 studies were included. Insulin resistance indicators were significantly improved after bariatric surgery. Leptin was also significantly decreased while adiponectin was significantly increased. Although the level of metabolic hormones changed after bariatric surgery, they were not statistically significant. Inflammation indicators were significantly decreased. Significant reduction was also detected in PAI-1 and sICAM-1. Bariatric surgery is beneficial in morbidly obese patients. Although treating obesity in a surgical way may cause some complications, the weight loss is generally safe and effective.",

    "abstract": "This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to summarize the effect of resveratrol intake on weight loss. We searched the following databases until July 2018: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Data were pooled using the inverse variance method and expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Out of 831 reports, 36 RCTs were eligible for including to our meta-analysis. The pooled results, using random-effects model showed that resveratrol supplementation significantly decreased body weight (SMD&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.17; 95% CI, -0.33, -0.01; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03; I<sup>2</sup>: 62.6), body mass index (BMI) (SMD&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.20; 95% CI, -0.35, -0.05; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01; I<sup>2</sup>: 60.6), fat mass (SMD&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.32; 95% CI, -0.62, -0.03; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03; I<sup>2</sup>: 77.9) and waist circumference (WC) (SMD&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.42; 95% CI, -0.68, -0.16; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001; I<sup>2</sup>: 75.2), and significantly increased lean mass (SMD&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.21; 95% CI, 0.75, 1.67; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001; I<sup>2</sup>: 87.6). We found no significant effect of resveratrol administration on leptin (SMD&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.20; 95% CI, -0.68, 0.27; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.40; I<sup>2</sup>: 85.3) and adiponectin levels (SMD&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.08; 95% CI, -0.39, 0.55; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.74; I<sup>2</sup>: 91.0). Resveratrol supplementation significantly decreased body weight in obese patients (SMD -0.43; 95% CI, -0.60, -0.26) compared with other diseases (SMD 0.02; 95% CI, -0.29, 0.33), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (SMD -0.17; 95% CI, -0.37, 0.02). Overall, the current meta-analysis demonstrated that resveratrol intake significantly reduced weight, BMI, WC and fat mass, and significantly increased lean mass, but did not affect leptin and adiponectin levels.",

    "title": "High frequency deep transcranial magnetic stimulation acutely increases &#x3b2;-endorphins in obese humans.",
    "abstract": "In obesity, metabolic and voluntary factors regulate appetite, and a dysregulation of the reward pathway was demonstrated in all addiction disorders. Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) is already used to modulate cerebral dopamine activation in neuro-psychiatric diseases. We presently assess the acute effect of high frequency (HF) and low frequency (LF) dTMS on the modulation of the main neuropeptides and neurotransmitters involved in the reward pathway in obese subjects. This study was designed as a double-blind, sham-controlled, randomized clinical trial. Thirty-three obese patients (9 males, 24 females, age 48.1&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;10.6, BMI 36.4&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.7) were enrolled in the study. All patients were studied during a single dTMS session and blood aliquots were drawn before and after a single dTMS session. Metabolic and neuro-endocrine parameters were evaluated before and after: (1) 18&#x2009;Hz dTMS (HF, 13 patients); (2) 1&#x2009;Hz dTMS (LF, 10 patients); (3) Sham treatment (Sham, 10 patients). No statistically significant variations in metabolic parameters, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate were shown acutely. HF showed a significant increase of &#x3b2;-endorphin compared to other groups (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.048); a significant increase of ghrelin in LF (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.041) was also demonstrated. A single session of HF dTMS treatment determines in obese subjects an acute increase of &#x3b2;-endorphin level, indicating an activation of the reward pathway. The present findings constitute proof of principle for a potential application of this methodology in obesity treatment.",

    "abstract": "To determine the difference of serum levels of 10 adipokines (apelin, chemerin, fatty acid-binding protein-4, fibroblast growth factor-21, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, nesfatin-1, omentin-1, resistin, vaspin, and visfatin) among women with gestational diabetes and healthy pregnant controls. Literature search was conducted using the Medline (1966-2018), Scopus (2004-2018), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (1999-2018), Clinicaltrials.gov (2008-2018) and Google Scholar (2004-2018) databases, along with the reference list of the included studies. Ninety-one studies were included in the present review, with a total number of 11,074 pregnant women. A meta-analysis was not conducted due to the high inter-study heterogeneity. Current evidence suggests that fatty acid-binding protein-4 levels are significantly increased in pregnancies complicated with gestational diabetes, while no association of serum apelin and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 with the disease can be supported. Data regarding the rest adipokines are conflicting, since the available studies did not unanimously indicate a significant change of their levels in gestational diabetes. The findings of the present systematic review suggest the promising role of fatty acid-binding protein-4 in the prediction of gestational diabetes, while inconsistent evidence exists regarding the rest novel adipokines. Future cohorts are needed to assess their predictive efficacy and fully elucidate their contribution in the disease.",

    "title": "Serum cytokines, adipokines and ferritin for non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis in chronic liver disease: a systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a major health problem worldwide. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), chronic hepatitis C (CHC), chronic hepatitis B (CHB), and alcoholic liver disease (ALD) are the most common etiologies of CLD. Liver biopsy is the gold standard for assessment of liver fibrosis, however, it is an invasive method. This review attempts to evaluate the usefulness of serum adiponectin, serum leptin, serum ferritin, serum transforming growth factor-&#x3b2;1 (TGF-&#x3b2;1), and serum platelet derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) as non-invasive markers in the diagnosis of liver fibrosis/cirrhosis. A systematic search in MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, and local databases was performed to identify articles published in English or Persian as of November 2017. Studies conducted among CLD patients, with biopsy proven fibrosis/cirrhosis, and providing sufficient details of patients' clinicopathological characteristics were included. In the 95 studies included, there were a total of 15,548 CLD patients. More than 83% of studies were carried out in Asia and Europe. The relationship between liver fibrosis/cirrhosis and serum levels of ferritin, adiponectin, leptin, TGF-&#x3b2;1, and PDGF-BB was assessed in 42, 33, 27, nine, and three studies, respectively. Serum levels of the markers, particularly ferritin, could successfully predict liver fibrosis/cirrhosis, however, these data might not be clinically replicated and further studies are needed.",

    "abstract": "The present randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluated the comparative efficacy of 12 week yoga-based lifestyle intervention (YBLI) and dietary intervention (DI) alone on adipokines, inflammation, and oxidative stress in Indian adults with metabolic syndrome (Met S). A parallel, two arm, RCT was conducted in Integral Health Clinic (IHC), All India Institute of Medical Sciences, India from 2012 to 2014. IHC is an outpatient facility conducting YBLI programs for prevention and management of chronic diseases. Two hundred sixty men and women (20-45 years) visiting the outpatient department of a tertiary care hospital were diagnosed with Met S and randomized 1:1 to receive 12 week YBLI (n = 130) or DI (n = 130). Primary outcomes were change in plasma levels of adipokines (leptin, adiponectin, and leptin:adiponectin ratio), markers of inflammation (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-&#x3b1;, interleukin [IL]-6), markers of oxidative stress (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances [TBARS], 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine [8-OHdG], and superoxide dismutase [SOD]) measured at baseline, 2 weeks, and 12 weeks. YBLI group showed a significant decrease in leptin, leptin:adiponectin ratio, IL-6, 8-OHdG, and TBARS levels, whereas there was a significant increase in adiponectin and SOD levels. No significant changes were noticed in DI alone group. YBLI showed significantly greater reduction in TBARS levels than in DI group, suggestive of reduced oxidative stress in adults with Met S. A 12 week YBLI had a positive impact on oxidative stress versus DI alone in adults with Met S.",
