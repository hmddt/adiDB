    "title": "Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 in the Pathophysiology of Late Life Depression.",
    "abstract": "Late life depression (LLD) is characterized by specific clinical features including a high frequency of vascular form and frequent antidepressant treatment resistance. The expression and functions of the serine protease inhibitor, Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is known to be altered by aging, vascular damage, insulin levels associated with a sedentary lifestyle, chronic stress leading to hypercortisolemia, and inflammatory changes linked to stress responses. These phenomena would be implicated in LLD like vascular depression. This article thus aims to review the existing literature regarding the association between LLD and plasmatic levels of PAI-1, a marker of hypofibrinolysis. We hypothesize that increased age would be associated with changes in PAI-1 plasma level and function which influence LLD pathogenesis and its treatment. Although a large number of studies on PAI-1 changes in the elderly exist, studies about its implications in LLD are sparse. Despite heterogeneous findings regarding the direction of variation in plasmatic PAI-1 levels among elderly participants with LLD, all studies demonstrated an association between PAI-1 levels and current or remitted depressive symptoms. Moreover, disruptions in the concentrations of other biological markers influencing PAI-1 expression, such as cytokines or adipokines, were also observed, notably an increase in the levels of interleukins 6 and 8. LLD genesis appears to be influenced by PAI-1 regulatory loops which are implicated in senescence or cell death. The resistance to antidepressant treatment appears to be linked to distinct biological profiles involving inflammatory and fibrinolytic factors. Taken together these data suggest that PAI-1 pathway may be a promising target of treatment development efforts for LLD, and depression in general.",

    "title": "NK2R control of energy expenditure and feeding to treat metabolic diseases.",
    "abstract": "The combination of decreasing food intake and increasing energy expenditure represents a powerful strategy for counteracting cardiometabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes<sup>1</sup>. Yet current pharmacological&#xa0;approaches require conjugation of multiple receptor agonists to achieve both effects<sup>2-4</sup>, and so far, no safe energy-expending option has reached the clinic. Here we show that activation of neurokinin 2 receptor (NK2R) is sufficient to suppress appetite centrally and increase energy expenditure peripherally. We focused on NK2R after revealing its genetic links to obesity and glucose control. However, therapeutically exploiting NK2R signalling has previously been unattainable because its endogenous ligand, neurokinin A, is short-lived and lacks receptor specificity<sup>5,6</sup>. Therefore, we developed selective, long-acting NK2R agonists with potential for once-weekly administration in humans. In mice, these agonists elicit weight loss by inducing energy expenditure and non-aversive appetite suppression that circumvents canonical leptin signalling. Additionally, a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp reveals that NK2R agonism acutely enhances insulin sensitization. In diabetic, obese macaques, NK2R activation significantly decreases body weight, blood glucose, triglycerides and cholesterol, and ameliorates insulin resistance. These findings identify a single receptor target that leverages both energy-expending and appetite-suppressing programmes to improve energy homeostasis and reverse cardiometabolic dysfunction across species.",

    "abstract": "Obesity and related diseases pose a major health risk, yet current anti-obesity drugs inadequately addressing clinical needs. Here we show AA005, an annonaceous acetogenin mimic, resists obesity induced by high-fat diets and leptin mutations at non-toxic doses, with the alpha subunit of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein (HADHA) as a target identified through proteomics and in vitro validation. Pharmacokinetic analysis shows AA005 enriches in adipose tissue, prompting the creation of adipose-specific Hadha-deficient mice. These mice significantly mitigate diet-induced obesity, echoing AA005's anti-obesity effects. AA005 treatment and Hadha deletion in adipose tissues increase body temperature and energy expenditure in high-fat diet-fed mice. The beneficial impact of AA005 on obesity mitigation is ineffective without uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), essential for thermogenesis regulation. Our investigation shows the interaction between AA005 and HADHA in mitochondria, activating the UCP1-mediated thermogenic pathway. This substantiates AA005 as a promising compound for obesity treatment, targeting HADHA specifically.",

    "abstract": "Secreted proteins have gained more and more attentions, since they can become therapeutic targets, drugs and biomarkers for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease and aging. In 2014, Metrnl (also named Meteorin-like, Cometin, Subfatin, Interleukin-39, Interleukin-41, Meteorin-&#x3b2;, and Metrn-&#x3b2;/Metrn&#x3b2;), as a novel secreted protein released from a certain tissue, was reported by us and others. During the past decade, the number of articles on Metrnl has continued to increase. Different sources of Metrnl have been described with different functions, including Metrnl as an adipokine for insulin sensitization, a cardiokine against cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction, an endothelium-derived factor against endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis, etc. Especially, we show that endothelial Metrnl is a major source for circulating Metrnl levels. Meanwhile, lots of clinical studies have investigated the relationship between blood Metrnl levels and metabolic, inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases. Metrnl appears a protective factor and a promising therapeutic target and/or drug against these diseases, given the relatively consistent conclusion from the preclinical studies. In addition to graphically demonstrating the role of Metrnl in various organs and diseases, this review will mainly describe the discovery of Metrnl, summarize the role of Metrnl in cardiovascular system that is a recently major progress in Metrnl research, and highlight several perspectives for future basic and translational research. Also, we suggest using one name Metrnl instead of other multiple names for the same protein.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin, a unique adipose-derived factor, is significantly downregulated in obesity, making it a crucial target for tumor-related metabolic research. AdipoRon is a novel adiponectin receptor agonist with the advantages of a small molecular weight, high stability and a long half-life. By screening the cervical adipose tissue of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) patients with adipokine antibody array, we found that adiponectin was a potential correlation factor between obesity and PTC progression. AdipoRon has oral activity and is easily absorbed and delivered to target tissues. The effects of AdipoRon on thyroid cancer have not been reported. In this study, we identified adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) and AdipoR2 on the surface of thyroid cancer cell lines. AdipoRon inhibited the proliferation and migration of thyroid cancer cells, limited energy metabolism in thyroid cancer cells, promoted differentiation of thyroid cancer cells, and induced autophagy and apoptosis. Mechanistic studies revealed that AdipoRon inhibited p-mTOR <sup>Ser2448</sup> and p-p70S6K <sup>Thr389</sup>, and activated ULK1 and p-ULK1. ULK1 knockdown suppressed the effect of AdipoRon on LC3BII/I protein and lysosomes. AdipoR2 knockdown reduced AdipoRon-induced autophagy in thyroid cancer cells. This study is the first to demonstrate the role of AdipoRon in PTC. Our findings illustrate a previously unknown function and mechanism of the AdipoRon-AdipoR2-ULK/p-ULK1 axis in PTC and lay the foundation for clinical translation of AdipoRon to PTC. Targeting the AdipoRon-AdipoR2-ULK/p-ULK1 axis may represent a new therapeutic strategy for PTC.",

    "abstract": "Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus are global public health issues. Although males show higher obesity and insulin resistance prevalence, current treatments often neglect sex-specific differences. White adipose tissue (WAT) is crucial in preventing lipotoxicity and inflammation and has become a key therapeutic target. Rosiglitazone (RSG), a potent PPAR&#x3b3; agonist, promotes healthy WAT growth and mitochondrial function through MitoNEET modulation. Recent RSG-based strategies specifically target white adipocytes, avoiding side effects. Our aim was to investigate whether sex-specific differences in the insulin-sensitizing effects of RSG exist on WAT during obesity and inflammation. We used Wistar rats of both sexes fed a high-fat diet (HFD, 22.5% fat content) for 16 weeks. Two weeks before sacrifice, a group of HFD-fed rats received RSG treatment (4 mg/kg of body weight per day) within the diet. HFD male rats showed greater insulin resistance, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and dyslipidemia than females. RSG had more pronounced effects in males, significantly improving insulin sensitivity, fat storage, mitochondrial function, and lipid handling in WAT while reducing ectopic fat deposition and enhancing adiponectin signaling in the liver. Our study suggests a significant sexual dimorphism in the anti-diabetic effects of RSG on WAT, correlating with the severity of metabolic dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "While linagliptin is the most potent dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor, its use is limited due to poor bioavailability and the potential risk of pancreatic injury. Here, we investigated whether the sustained weekly administration of linagliptin could provide better effect compared to frequent daily oral administration. Type 2 diabetes was induced by feeding rats a high fructose/fat/salt diet followed by STZ injection. Compared to the partial glycemic control achieved with daily oral linagliptin, a weekly subcutaneous injection containing about one-fourth of the oral dose produced superior glycemic control, as evidenced by the 4-week postprandial glucose follow-up and oral glucose tolerance test. This was confirmed by the significant increase in serum insulin in the case of the sustained linagliptin administration. Higher levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine adiponectin and lower triglyceride levels were observed after sustained linagliptin administration compared with daily oral linagliptin. In addition, sustained linagliptin displayed a significant increase in &#x3b2;-cells' insulin immunoreactivity when compared with daily linagliptin. More reduction in collagen deposition and caspase-3 immunoreactivity in pancreatic tissue were observed in sustained linagliptin compared with oral linagliptin. In conclusion, sustained linagliptin administration provided superior glycemic control, which seems to be mediated by more reduction in pancreatic injury.",

    "title": "The adipose tissue melanocortin 3 receptor is targeted by ghrelin and leptin and may be a therapeutic target in obesity.",
    "abstract": "Obesity is linked to perturbations in energy balance mechanisms, including ghrelin and leptin actions at the hypothalamic circuitry of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and melanocortin. However, information about the regulation of this system in the periphery is still scarce. Our objective was to study the regulation of the NPY/melanocortin system in the adipose tissue (AT) and evaluate its therapeutic potential for obesity and type 2 diabetes. The expression of the NPY/melanocortin receptors' levels was assessed in the visceral AT of individuals with obesity and altered metabolism. Protein levels of these receptors were evaluated in cultured adipocytes incubated with ghrelin (30 and 100&#xa0;ng/mL) and leptin (1 and 10&#xa0;nM) and in the AT of an animal model with a mutation in the leptin receptor (ZSF1 rat), to understand their regulation by leptin and ghrelin. The vertical sleeve gastrectomy animal model was used to evaluate the putative therapeutic potential of the NPY/melanocortin system. In this study, we unravelled that leptin (1&#xa0;nM and 10&#xa0;nM) selectively reduced the levels of NPY5R and MC3R but no other NPYR/MCRs in cultured adipocytes. In turn, acylated ghrelin (100&#xa0;ng/mL) significantly increased NPY1R, but the inhibition of its receptor also abrogates MC3R levels. However, in the Lepr-deficient ZSF1 rat, both NPY5R and MC3R levels were reduced, along with other NPYRs and MCRs, suggesting that leptin resistance negatively affects NPY and melanocortin signalling. In human adipose tissue, we found a downregulation of genes encoding the NPY and melanocortin receptors in the visceral AT of individuals with obesity and insulin resistance, being correlated with genes regulating metabolic activity. Additionally, diabetic obese rats submitted to vertical sleeve gastrectomy showed increased levels of NPY, melanocortin, ghrelin, and leptin receptors in the AT, including MC3R, suggesting it may constitute a therapeutic target in obesity. Our results suggest that the AT NPY/melanocortin system, particularly the MC3R, may be involved in the neuroendocrine regulation of adipocyte metabolism. Altogether, our work shows MC3R is under the control of the ghrelin/leptin duo, is reduced in patients with obesity and prediabetes, and may constitute a therapeutic target in obesity.",

    "title": "Endothelial Dysfunction in Obesity and Therapeutic Targets.",
    "abstract": "Parallel to the increasing prevalence of obesity in the world, the mortality from cardiovascular disease has also increased. Low-grade chronic inflammation in obesity disrupts vascular homeostasis, and the dysregulation of adipocyte-derived endocrine and paracrine effects contributes to endothelial dysfunction. Besides the adipose tissue inflammation, decreased nitric oxide (NO)-bioavailability, insulin resistance (IR), and oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDLs) are the main factors contributing to endothelial dysfunction in obesity and the development of cardiorenal metabolic syndrome. While normal healthy perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) ensures the dilation of blood vessels, obesity-associated PVAT leads to a change in the profile of the released adipo-cytokines, resulting in a decreased vasorelaxing effect. Higher stiffness parameter &#x3b2;, increased oxidative stress, upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) oxidase in PVAT turn the macrophages into pro-atherogenic phenotypes by oxLDL-induced adipocyte-derived exosome-macrophage crosstalk and contribute to the endothelial dysfunction. In clinical practice, carotid ultrasound, higher leptin levels correlate with irisin over-secretion by human visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues, and remnant cholesterol (RC) levels predict atherosclerotic disease in obesity. As a novel therapeutic strategy for cardiovascular protection, liraglutide improves vascular dysfunction by modulating a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-independent protein kinase A (PKA)-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway in PVAT in obese individuals. Because the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activity, hyperinsulinemia, and the resultant IR play key roles in the progression of cardiovascular disease in obesity, RAAS-targeted therapies contribute to improving endothelial dysfunction. By contrast, arginase reciprocally inhibits NO formation and promotes oxidative stress. Thus, targeting arginase activity as a key mediator in endothelial dysfunction has therapeutic potential in obesity-related vascular comorbidities. Obesity-related endothelial dysfunction plays a pivotal role in the progression of type 2 diabetes (T2D). The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR&#x3b3;) agonist, rosiglitazone (thiazolidinedione), is a popular drug for treating diabetes; however, it leads to increased cardiovascular risk. Selective sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor empagliflozin (EMPA) significantly improves endothelial dysfunction and mortality occurring through redox-dependent mechanisms. Although endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress are alleviated by either metformin or EMPA, currently used drugs to treat obesity-related diabetes neither possess the same anti-inflammatory potential nor simultaneously target endothelial cell dysfunction and obesity equally. While therapeutic interventions with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor&#xa0;agonist liraglutide or bariatric surgery reverse regenerative cell exhaustion, support vascular repair mechanisms, and improve cardiometabolic risk in individuals with T2D and obesity, the GLP-1 analog exendin-4 attenuates endothelial endoplasmic reticulum stress.",

    "abstract": "Despite efforts to elucidate the cellular adaptations induced by obesity, cellular bioenergetics is currently considered a crucial target. New strategies to delay the onset of the hazardous adaptations induced by obesity are needed. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of 4 weeks of melatonin treatment on mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism in the livers of leptin-deficient mice. Our results revealed that the absence of leptin increased lipid storage in the liver and induced significant mitochondrial alterations, which were ultimately responsible for defective ATP production and reactive oxygen species overproduction. Moreover, leptin deficiency promoted mitochondrial biogenesis, fusion, and outer membrane permeabilization. Melatonin treatment reduced the bioenergetic deficit found in ob/ob mice, alleviating some mitochondrial alterations in the electron transport chain machinery, biogenesis, dynamics, respiration, ATP production, and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. Given the role of melatonin in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis, it could be used as a therapeutic agent against adipogenic steatosis.",

    "abstract": "Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) begins with hepatic lipid accumulation, and leptin has antisteatosis properties. In this study, we investigated the effects of leptin on hepatic steatosis and inflammation through the vagal pathway independently of the inhibitory effect of food intake. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were matched for food intake after the high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity model and were injected intraperitoneally with leptin or leptin + lidocaine for 6 weeks. Control rats received equal volumes of saline. Adipose tissue mass, NAFLD activity scores (NAS), hepatic inflammatory factors, hepatic triglyceride content and hepatic lipid metabolism-related protein levels were evaluated. Leptin ameliorated HFD-induced hepatic lipid accumulation, improved NAS, and decreased tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1; (TNF-&#x3b1;), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) levels in the presence of matched intake. Lidocaine decreased the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT3) expression in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and abrogated the leptin-mediated improvement. Leptin increased hypothalamic phosphorylated Janus kinase 2 (p-JAK2) and p-STAT3 expression, as well as the expression of mitochondrial respiratory chain-related genes. Leptin also increased hepatic phosphorylated adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) expression and phosphorylation of its downstream target acetyl Co A carboxylase 1 (ACC1), reducing de novo lipogenesis. Our results suggest that leptin ameliorated hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation by activating the JAK2-STAT3/AMPK pathway through the vagal pathway independently of the inhibitory effect of ingestion. Leptin has the potential to be a drug for early NAFLD treatment.",

    "title": "FNDC4 reduces hepatocyte inflammatory cell death via AMPK&#x3b1; in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.",
    "abstract": "The molecular mediators responsible for the progression of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) to steatohepatitis (MASH) have not yet been completely disentangled. We sought to analyze whether FNDC4, an hepatokine and adipokine with anti-inflammatory properties, is involved in TNF-&#x3b1;-induced inflammatory cell death in patients with MASLD. Plasma FNDC4 (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;168) and hepatic FNDC4 and inflammatory cell death (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;65) were measured in samples from patients with severe obesity with available liver biopsy-proven MASLD diagnosis. The effect of FNDC4 on TNF-&#x3b1;-induced pyroptosis, apoptosis and necroptosis (PANoptosis) and mitochondrial dysfunction was studied in&#xa0;vitro using human HepG2 hepatocytes. Compared with individuals with normal liver, patients with type 2 diabetes and MASLD exhibited decreased hepatic FNDC4 mRNA and protein levels, which were related to liver inflammation. An overexpression of TNF-&#x3b1;, its receptor TNF-R1 and factors involved in inflammatory cell death was also found in the liver of these patients. FNDC4-knockdown in HepG2 hepatocytes increased apoptotic cell death, while FNDC4 treatment blunted NLRP3 inflammasome-induced pyroptosis, apoptosis and necroptosis in TNF-&#x3b1;-stimulated hepatocytes. Moreover, FNDC4 improved TNF-&#x3b1;-induced hepatocyte mitochondrial dysfunction by enhancing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and OXPHOS complex subunits I, II, III and V protein expression. Mechanistically, AMP-activated protein kinase &#x3b1; (AMPK&#x3b1;) was required for the FNDC4-mediated inhibition of cell death and increase in mtDNA content. FNDC4 acts as a hepatocyte survival factor favouring mitochondrial homeostasis and decreasing inflammatory cell death via AMPK&#x3b1;. Collectively, our study identifies FNDC4 as an attractive target to prevent hepatocellular damage in patients with MASLD.",

    "abstract": "Tirzepatide (Tzp), a novel dual agonist glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide/glucagon-like peptide-1, is approved for treating insulin resistance and obesity, and menopausal women consuming a high-calorie diet are a target to study the Tzp effect. Therefore, we aimed to allometrically scale body weight (BW) in Tzp-treated obese diabetic menopausal mice. Three-month-old C57BL/6 female mice had bilateral ovariectomy (Ovx) or a sham procedure and for 12&#x2009;weeks were fed a control diet or a high-fat and high sucrose diet (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;120/each group [control (C), obese diabetic (Od), Ovx (O), sham (S), Tzp (T)]). Tzp was subcutaneously administered (10&#x2009;nmol/kg) or vehicle once a day for an additional 4&#x2009;weeks. The analysis considered log-transformed data and the allometric equation log y&#x2009;=&#x2009;log a&#x2009;+&#x2009;b log x. Od and OdO showed more upward slopes than C and CO. In C, BW was non-allometric by T administration. Od and OdO showed slightly positive slopes (more prominent in OdO than Od). OdT and OdOT showed negative slopes, significant intercepts, and more robust Pearson coefficients than untreated ones. A potent drug effect was seen with BW allometric decline. Interactions between diet versus Ovx and diet versus Tzp affected weight gain. Diet versus Ovx versus Tzp affected food intake. A model was developed to show three usual factors observed in mature women. Notably, Tzp improved the metabolism and weight loss of OdO mice. Tzp-treated mice showed negative allometric BW across treatment time, which is a quantitative assessment that allows better comparison between results.",

    "abstract": "Heart failure represents the terminal stage of various cardiovascular diseases. This study aims to explore the pharmacological mechanisms underlying the protective effect of Ginsenoside Rg3 against heart failure. Potential targets of Ginsenoside Rg3 were identified using SwissTargetPrediction and the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database, while heart failure-related genes were retrieved from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database, Therapeutic Target Database, DisGeNET, and PharmGKB. Overlapping of Ginsenoside Rg3 targets with heart failure-related genes identified drug-disease interaction genes. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were conducted on the drug-disease interaction genes to elucidate their biological functions. A protein-protein interaction network was constructed using the drug-disease interaction genes, and the hub genes were identified by topological analysis. Additionally, we validate the expression of IL-6 and TNF by real-time PCR. The intersection of Ginsenoside Rg3 targets and heart failure-related genes yielded 15 drug-disease interaction genes. Enrichment analysis highlighted the involvement of inflammation-related GO terms and KEGG pathways, such as positive regulation of interleukin-8 and -6 production, regulation of immune effector process, cytokine receptor binding, cytokine activity, adipocytokine signaling pathway, and IL-17 signaling pathway, which are implicated in the cardioprotective effect. Topological analysis revealed four hub genes: STAT3, CASP3, TNF, and IL-6. The application of Ginsenoside Rg3 significantly reversed the elevated levels of IL-6 and TNF in the isoproterenol-treated H9c2 cell line. Our findings suggest that the cardioprotective effect of Ginsenoside Rg3 may be mediated through its anti-inflammation properties. Further research is required to elucidate and validate the detailed cardioprotective mechanisms of Ginsenoside Rg3.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of hyper-phosphorylated tau and amyloid beta (A&#x3b2;) are key pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Increasing evidence indicates that in the early pre-clinical stages of AD, phosphorylation and build-up of tau drives impairments in hippocampal excitatory synaptic function, which ultimately leads to cognitive deficits. Consequently, limiting tau-related synaptic abnormalities may have beneficial effects in AD. There is now significant evidence that the hippocampus is an important brain target for the endocrine hormone leptin and that leptin has pro-cognitive properties, as activation of synaptic leptin receptors markedly influences higher cognitive processes including learning and memory. Clinical studies have identified a link between the circulating leptin levels and the risk of AD, such that AD risk is elevated when leptin levels fall outwith the physiological range. This has fuelled interest in targeting the leptin system therapeutically. Accumulating evidence supports this possibility, as numerous studies have shown that leptin has protective effects in a variety of models of AD. Recent findings have demonstrated that leptin has beneficial effects in the preclinical stages of AD, as leptin prevents the early synaptic impairments driven by tau protein and amyloid &#x3b2;. Here we review recent findings that implicate the leptin system as a potential novel therapeutic target in AD.",

    "abstract": "Intrauterine adhesion (IUA) is manifestations of endometrial fibrosis and excessive extracellular matrix deposition. C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein-6 (CTRP6) is a newly identified adiponectin paralog which has been reported to modulate the fibrosis process of several diseases; however, the endometrial fibrosis function of CTRP6 remains unknown. Our study aimed to assess the role of CTRP6 in endometrial fibrosis and further explore the underlying mechanism. Here, we found that the expression of CTRP6 was downregulated in the endometrial tissues of IUA. In vitro experiments demonstrated the reduced level of CTRP6 in facilitated transforming growth factor-&#x3b2;1 (TGF-&#x3b2;1)-induced human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs). In addition, CTRP6 inhibited the expression of &#x3b1;-smooth muscle actin (&#x3b1;-SMA) and collagen I in TGF-&#x3b2;1-treated HESCs. Mechanistically, CTRP6 activated the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and protein kinase B (AKT) pathway in HESCs, and AMPK inhibitor (AraA) or PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) pretreatment abolished the protective effect of CTRP6 on TGF-&#x3b2;1-induced fibrosis. CTRP6 markedly decreased TGF-&#x3b2;1-induced Smad3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, and AMPK or AKT inhibition reversed these effects. Notably, CTRP6-overexpressing treatment alleviated the fibrosis of endometrium in vivo. Therefore, CTRP6 ameliorates endometrial fibrosis, among which AMPK and AKT are essential for the anti-fibrotic effect of CTRP6 via the Smad3 pathway. Taken together, CTRP6 may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of intrauterine adhesion.",

    "abstract": "Sleep and stress interact bidirectionally by acting on brain circuits that affect metabolism. Sleep and its alterations have impact on blood leptin levels, metabolic hormone that regulates appetite. Brain expresses the receptors for the peptide hormone leptin produced from adipocytes. The hypothalamic orexin neurons are low during sleep and active when awake, influenced by a complex interaction with leptin. Thymoquinone was found to be the major bioactive component of&#xa0;Nigella sativa. The aim of this study was to study the role of thymoquinone on sleep restriction and its mitigating effect on leptin-mediated signaling pathway in rat brain. 30 adult male Wistar rats were divided into 5 groups with 6 animals in each group:&#xa0;Control;&#xa0;Thymoquinone (TQ); Corn oil; Chronic Sleep restriction (CSR); and CSR&#x2009;+&#x2009;TQ. After 30&#xa0;days,&#xa0;behavioral analysis, antioxidant, lipid profile, glucose level, liver and kidney function test, neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and mRNA expression in in vivo studies were also assessed and pharmacokinetic and docking were done for thymoquinone.&#xa0;Thymoquinone has also shown good binding affinity to the target proteins. CSR has&#xa0;induced oxidative stress in the discrete brain regions and plasma.&#xa0;Current study has shown many evidences that sleep restriction has altered the neurobehavioral, antioxidant status, lipid profile, neurotransmitters, neuropeptide levels, and feeding behavior which damage the Orexin-leptin&#xa0;system which regulates the sleep and feeding that leads to metabolic dysfunction. The potentiality of Thymoquinone was revealed in in silico studies, and its action in in vivo studies has proved its effectiveness. The study concludes that Thymoquinone has exhibited its effect by diminishing the metabolic dysfunction by its neuroprotective, antioxidant, and hypolipidemic properties.",

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability and is the leading known single-gene cause of autism spectrum disorder. Patients with FXS display varied behavioural deficits that include mild to severe cognitive impairments in addition to mood disorders. Currently, there is no cure for this condition; however, there is an emerging focus on therapies that inhibit mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent protein synthesis owing to the clinical effectiveness of metformin for alleviating some behavioural symptoms in FXS. Adiponectin (APN) is a neurohormone that is released by adipocytes and provides an alternative means to inhibit mTOR activation in the brain. In these studies, we show that Fmr1 knockout mice, like patients with FXS, show reduced levels of circulating APN and that both long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in the dentate gyrus (DG) are impaired. Brief (20 min) incubation of hippocampal slices in APN (50 nM) was able to rescue both LTP and LTD in the DG and increased both the surface expression and phosphorylation of GluA1 receptors. These results provide evidence for reduced APN levels in FXS playing a role in decreasing bidirectional synaptic plasticity and show that therapies which enhance APN levels may have therapeutic potential for this and related conditions.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Long-term potentiation: 50 years on'.",

    "title": "Analysis of the Level of Adiponectin and Selected Cytokines in Patients with Knee Osteoarthritis.",
    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a degenerative disease that is continuously targeting people of different ages, but especially the elderly population, the number of which tends to increase continuously at the global level. Apart from age, excess weight can influence the evolution of the disease, with obesity being associated with a weak inflammation stage and an imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. The present work aimed to analyze specific biomarkers, namely ACRP-30, IL-10, TNF-&#x3b1;, and IL-6, in knee synovial fluid, and correlate them with KOA patients' clinical data, radiographic changes, and functional and pain scores. Materials and Methods: 24 subjects with KOA and over 50 years of age participate in the present study. Synovial fluid was harvested using ultrasound guidance from the target knees of the enrolled KOA patients, and the levels of ACRP-30, IL-10, TNF-&#x3b1;, and IL-6 were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). All patients underwent a supine X-ray at the target knee and were classified using Kellgren-Lawrence (K-L) grading. The Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) was used to assess self-reported physical function, pain, and stiffness. Results: The obtained results highlighted a significant correlation between age and adiponectin level (p = 0.0451, r = -0.412). Also, the IL-10 values are lower in cases where the intensity of the pain is more pronounced (p = 0.0405, r = -0.421). In addition, analyzing the data by gender, it was observed that in the case of males, stiffness is more related to age (p = 0.0079, r = 0.7993), compared to women (p = 0.0203, r = 0.6223). In the case of women, the progression of the disease tends to increase more intensively the WOMAC score's total values (p = 0.00031, r = 0.8342), compared with men (p = 0.0289, r = 7013). Regarding interleukins and BMI, significant correlations were observed only in the case of men. Conclusions: A significant correlation between age and adiponectin, and adiponectin and IL-6, suggests that advanced age may contribute to adiponectin reduction. Comparing men with women, it was observed that men's age is more related to rigidity, and IL-6 and IL-10 are directly correlated to BMI; in addition, women seem to be more sensitive to pain and stiffness.",

    "abstract": "Myxomatous valve disease (MVD) is the most common cause of mitral regurgitation, leading to impaired cardiac function and heart failure. MVD in a mouse model of Marfan syndrome includes valve leaflet thickening and progressive valve degeneration. However, the underlying mechanisms by which the disease progresses remain undefined. Mice with Fibrillin 1 gene variant Fbn1<sup>C1039G/+</sup> recapitulate histopathologic features of Marfan syndrome, and Wnt (Wingless-related integration site) signaling activity was detected in TCF/Lef-lacZ (T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor-&#x3b2;-galactosidase) reporter mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed from mitral valves of wild-type and Fbn1<sup>C1039G/+</sup> mice at 1 month of age. Inhibition of Wnt signaling was achieved by conditional induction of the secreted Wnt inhibitor Dkk1 (Dickkopf-1) expression in periostin-expressing valve interstitial cells of Periostin-Cre; tetO-Dkk1; R26rtTA; TCF/Lef-lacZ; Fbn1<sup>C1039G/+</sup> mice. Dietary doxycycline was administered for 1 month beginning with MVD initiation (1-month-old) or MVD progression (2-month-old). Histological evaluation and immunofluorescence for ECM (extracellular matrix) and immune cells were performed. Wnt signaling is activated early in mitral valve disease progression, before immune cell infiltration in Fbn1<sup>C1039G/+</sup> mice. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed similar mitral valve cell heterogeneity between wild-type and Fbn1<sup>C1039G/+</sup> mice at 1 month of age. Wnt pathway genes were predominantly expressed in valve interstitial cells and valve endothelial cells of Fbn1<sup>C1039G/+</sup> mice. Inhibition of Wnt signaling in Fbn1<sup>C1039G/+</sup> mice at 1 month of age prevented the initiation of MVD as indicated by improved ECM remodeling and reduced valve leaflet thickness with decreased infiltrating macrophages. However, later, Wnt inhibition starting at 2 months did not prevent the progression of MVD. Wnt signaling is involved in the initiation of mitral valve abnormalities and inflammation but is not responsible for later-stage valve disease progression once it has been initiated. Thus, Wnt signaling contributes to MVD progression in a time-dependent manner and provides a promising therapeutic target for the early treatment of congenital MVD in Marfan syndrome.",

    "abstract": "White adipose tissue (WAT) is involved in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study explored its potential as an antirheumatic target. WAT status of healthy and adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rats were compared. The contribution of WAT to RA pathology was evaluated by pre-adipocyte transplant experiments and by dissecting perirenal fat pads of AIA rats. The impact of RA on WAT was investigated by culturing pre-adipocytes. Proteins differentially expressed in WAT of healthy and AIA rats were identified by the UPLC/MS<sup>2</sup> method. These together with PPAR&#x3b3; siRNA and agonist were used to treat pre-adipocytes in vitro. The medium was used for THP-1 monocyte culture. Compared with healthy controls, AIA WAT was smaller but secreted more leptin, eNAMPT, MCP-1, TNF-&#x3b1;, and IL-6. AIA rat pre-adipocytes increased the levels of these adipokines in healthy recipients. RA patients' serum induced a similar secretion change and impaired differentiation of pre-adipocytes. Adipectomy eased AIA-related immune abnormalities and arthritic manifestations. Hepatokines PON1, IGFBP4, and GPIHBP1 were among the differential proteins in high levels in RA blood, and induced inflammatory secretions by pre-adipocytes. GPIHBP1 inhibited PPAR&#x3b3; expression and caused differentiation impairment and inflammatory secretion by pre-adipocytes, a similar outcome to PPAR&#x3b3;-silencing. This endowed the cells with an ability to activate monocytes, which can be abrogated by rosiglitazone. Certain hepatokines potentiate inflammatory secretions by pre-adipocytes and expedite RA progression by inhibiting PPAR&#x3b3;. Targeting this signalling or abnormal WAT secretion by various approaches may reduce RA severity.",

    "title": "Interleukin-4 inhibits the hypothalamic appetite control by modulating the insulin-AKT and JAK-STAT signaling in leptin mutant mice.",
    "abstract": "Our previous research identified interleukin-4 (IL-4) as a key regulator of glucose/lipid metabolism, circulatory leptin levels, and insulin action, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for obesity and related complications. This study aimed to further elucidate the role of IL-4 in regulating hypothalamic appetite-controlling neuropeptides using leptin dysfunctional Leptin<sup>145E/145E</sup> mice as the experimental model. IL-4 significantly reduces body weight, food intake, and serum glucose levels. Our data demonstrated that IL-4 exhibits multiple functions in regulating hypothalamic appetite control, including downregulating orexigenic agouti-related peptide and neuropeptide Y levels, promoting expression of anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin, alleviating microenvironmental hypothalamic inflammation, enhancing leptin and insulin pathway, and attenuating insulin resistance. Furthermore, IL-4 promotes uncoupling protein 1 expression of white adipose tissue (WAT), suggesting its role in triggering WAT-beige switch. In summary, this study uncovers novel function of IL-4 in mediating food-intake behaviors and metabolic efficiency by regulating hypothalamic appetite-control and WAT browning activities. These findings support the therapeutic potential of targeting hypothalamic inflammation and reducing adiposity through IL-4 intervention for tackling the pandemic increasing prevalence of obesity and associated metabolic disorders.",

    "title": "Homotherapy for heteropathy: Interleukin-41 and its biological functions.",
    "abstract": "Interleukin-41 (IL-41) is a newly discovered cytokine, named Cometin, Subfatin, meteorin-like transcription (Metrnl), and so forth. It is widely expressed in animals and can exert its biological roles through autocrine and paracrine forms. It has functions such as anti-inflammatory, improving body metabolism, regulating immunity, regulating fat metabolism and participates in the process of autoimmune disease or inflammatory injury. It plays an important role in psoriasis, diabetes, Crohn's disease (CD), osteoarthritis, Kawasaki disease (KD), Graves' disease, autoimmune hepatitis, infertility, obesity, sepsis, cardiovascular diseases and respiratory diseases. This paper reviews the biological functions of IL-41, the relationship between IL-41 and diseases, the effects of IL-41 in the cytokine network and the possible signalling pathways. In order to explore the same target or the same drug for the treatment of different diseases from the perspective of homotherapy for heteropathy, cytokine strategies based on IL-41 have been put forward for the precise treatment of immune diseases and inflammatory diseases. It is worth noting that IL-41 related preparations for lung protection and smoking cessation are interesting research fields.",

    "abstract": "Mibavademab (previously known as REGN4461), a fully human monoclonal antibody, is being investigated for the treatment of conditions associated with leptin deficiency. Here, we report pharmacokinetics (PKs), pharmacodynamics, and immunogenicity from a phase I study in healthy participants (NCT03530514). In part A, lean or overweight healthy participants were randomized to single-ascending-dose cohorts of 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, 10, and 30&#x2009;mg/kg intravenous (i.v.), or 300 and 600&#x2009;mg subcutaneous doses of mibavademab or placebo. In part B, overweight or obese participants were randomized to receive multiple doses of mibavademab (15&#x2009;mg/kg i.v. loading dose and 10&#x2009;mg/kg i.v. at weeks 3, 6, and 9) or placebo, stratified by body mass index and baseline leptin levels: low leptin (&lt;5&#x2009;ng/mL) or relatively low leptin (5-8&#x2009;ng/mL in men and 5-24&#x2009;ng/mL in women). Fifty-six and 55 participants completed the single-ascending-dose and multiple-dose parts, respectively. In the single-ascending-dose cohorts, mibavademab PKs were nonlinear with target-mediated elimination, greater than dose-proportional increases in exposure, and there were no dose-dependent differences in total soluble leptin receptor (sLEPR) levels in serum over time. Following multiple-dose administration of mibavademab in participants with leptin &lt;8&#x2009;ng/mL, lower mean mibavademab concentrations, higher mean total sLEPR concentrations, and larger mean decreases in body weight than in the relatively low leptin cohorts were observed. Baseline leptin was correlated with mibavademab PKs and pharmacodynamics. No treatment-emergent anti-mibavademab antibodies were observed in any mibavademab-treated participant. Results from this study collectively inform further development of mibavademab to treat conditions associated with leptin deficiency.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to environmental pollutants, including nanomaterials, has a significant impact on tumor progression. The increased demand for black phosphorus nanosheets (BPNSs), driven by their exceptional properties, raises concerns about potential environmental contamination. Assessing their toxicity on tumor growth is essential. Herein, we employed a range of biological techniques, including cytotoxicity measurement, bioinformatics tools, proteomics, target gene overexpression, Western blot analysis, and apoptosis detection, to investigate the toxicity of BPNSs across A549, HepG-2, MCF-7, and Caco-2&#xa0;cell lines. Our results demonstrated that BPNSs downregulated the expression of ADIPOQ and its associated downstream pathways, such as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and other unidentified pathways. These downregulated pathways ultimately led to mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. Notably, the specific downstream pathways involved varied depending on the type of tumors. These insightful findings not only confirm the consistent inhibitory effects of BPNSs across different tumor cells, but also elucidate the cytotoxicity mechanisms of BPNSs in different tumors, providing valuable information for their safe application and health risk assessment.",

    "abstract": "The diverse beneficial effects of adiponectin-receptor signaling, including its impact on the regulation of inflammatory processes in vivo, have resulted in development of adiponectin receptor agonists as a treatment for metabolic disorders. However, there are no established non-invasive bioassays for detection of adiponectin target engagement in humans or animal models. Here, we designed an assay using small amounts of blood to assess adiponectin action. Specifically, we tested effects of the small 10-amino acid peptide adiponectin receptor agonist, ALY688, in a sublethal LPS endotoxemia model in mice. LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in serum were significantly reduced in mice treated with ALY688, assessed via multiplex ELISA in flow cytometry. Furthermore, ALY688 alone significantly induced TGF-&#x3b2; release in serum 1&#xa0;h after treatment and was elevated for up to 24&#xa0;h. Additionally, using a flow-cytometry panel for detection of changes in circulating immune cell phenotypes, we observed a significant increase in absolute T cell counts in mice after ALY688 treatment. To assess changes in intracellular signaling effectors downstream of adiponectin, phospho-flow cytometry was conducted. There was a significant increase in phosphorylation of AMPK and p38-MAPK in mice after ALY688 treatment. We then used human donor immune cells (PBMCs) treated with ALY688 ex vivo and observed elevation of AMPK and p38-MAPK phosphorylation from baseline in response to ALY688. Together, these results indicate we can detect adiponectin action on immune cells in vivo by assessing adiponectin signaling pathway for AMPK and p38-MAPK, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. This new approach provides a blood-based bioassay for screening adiponectin action.",

    "abstract": "Aging-related cardiac dysfunction poses a major risk factor of mortality for elderly populations, however, efficient treatment for aging-related cardiac dysfunction is far from being known. Isthmin-1 (ISM1) is a novel adipokine that promotes glucose uptake and acts indispensable roles in restraining inflammatory and fibrosis. The present study aims to investigate the potential role and molecular mechanism of ISM1 in aging-related cardiac dysfunction. Aged and matched young mice were overexpressed or silenced with ISM1 to investigate the role of ISM1 in aging-related cardiac dysfunction. Moreover, H9C2 cells were stimulated with D-galactose (D-gal) to examine the role of ISM1 in vitro. Herein, we found that cardiac-specific overexpression of ISM1 significantly mitigated insulin resistance by promoting glucose uptake in aging mice. ISM1 overexpression alleviated while ISM1 silencing deteriorated cellular senescence, cardiac inflammation, and dysfunction in natural and accelerated cardiac aging. Mechanistically, ISM1 promoted glycolysis and activated Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) through increasing glucose uptake. ISM1 increased glucose uptake via translocating GLUT4 to the surface, thereby enhancing glycolytic flux and hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) flux, ultimately leading to increased SIRT1 activity through O-GlcNAc modification. ISM1 may serve as a novel potential therapeutic target for preventing aging-related cardiac disease in elderly populations. ISM1 prevents aging-related cardiac dysfunction by promoting glycolysis and enhancing SIRT1 deacetylase activity, making it a promising therapeutic target for aging-related cardiac disease.",

    "title": "Antidiabetic features of AdipoAI, a novel AdipoR agonist.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin is an antidiabetic endogenous adipokine that plays a protective role against the unfavorable metabolic sequelae of obesity. Recent evidence suggests a sinister link between hypoadiponectinemia and development of insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes (T2D). Adiponectin's insulin-sensitizing property is mediated through the specific adiponectin receptors R1 and R2, which activate the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) &#x3b1; pathways. AdipoAI is a novel synthetic analogue of endogenous adiponectin with possibly similar pharmacological effects. Thus, there is a need of orally active small molecules that activate Adipoq subunits, and their downstream signaling, which could ameliorate obesity related type 2 diabetes. In the study we aim to investigate the effects of AdipoAI on obesity and T2D. Through in-vitro and in-vivo analyses, we investigated the antidiabetic potentials of AdipoAI and compared it with AdipoRON, another orally active adiponectin receptors agonist. Our results showed that in-vitro treatment of AdipoAI (0-5&#x2009;&#xb5;M) increased adiponectin receptor subunits AdipoR1/R2 with increase in AMPK and APPL1 protein expression in C2C12 myotubes. Similarly, in-vivo, oral administration of AdipoAI (25&#x2009;mg/kg) observed similar effects as that of AdipoRON (50&#x2009;mg/kg) with improved control of blood glucose and insulin sensitivity in diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice models. Further, AdipoAI significantly reduced epididymal fat content with decrease in inflammatory markers and increase in PPAR-&#x3b1; and AMPK levels and exhibited hepatoprotective effects in liver. Further, AdipoAI and AdipoRON also observed similar results in adipose tissue. Thus, our results suggest that low doses of orally active small molecule agonist of adiponectin AdipoAI can be a promising therapeutic target for obesity and T2D.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer remains a major public health challenge worldwide. The identification of accurate biomarkers is critical for the early detection and effective treatment of breast cancer. This study utilizes an integrative machine learning approach to analyze breast cancer gene expression data for superior biomarker and drug target discovery. Gene expression datasets, obtained from the GEO database, were merged post-preprocessing. From the merged dataset, differential expression analysis between breast cancer and normal samples revealed 164 differentially expressed genes. Meanwhile, a separate gene expression dataset revealed 350 differentially expressed genes. Additionally, the BGWO_SA_Ens algorithm, integrating binary grey wolf optimization and simulated annealing with an ensemble classifier, was employed on gene expression datasets to identify predictive genes including TOP2A, AKR1C3, EZH2, MMP1, EDNRB, S100B, and SPP1. From over 10,000 genes, BGWO_SA_Ens identified 1404 in the merged dataset (F1 score: 0.981, PR-AUC: 0.998, ROC-AUC: 0.995) and 1710 in the GSE45827 dataset (F1 score: 0.965, PR-AUC: 0.986, ROC-AUC: 0.972). The intersection of DEGs and BGWO_SA_Ens selected genes revealed 35 superior genes that were consistently significant across methods. Enrichment analyses uncovered the involvement of these superior genes in key pathways such as AMPK, Adipocytokine, and PPAR signaling. Protein-protein interaction network analysis highlighted subnetworks and central nodes. Finally, a drug-gene interaction investigation revealed connections between superior genes and anticancer drugs. Collectively, the machine learning workflow identified a robust gene signature for breast cancer, illuminated their biological roles, interactions and therapeutic associations, and underscored the potential of computational approaches in biomarker discovery and precision oncology.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer has a special tumor microenvironment compared to other solid tumors, which is usually surrounded by a large number of adipocytes that can produce and secrete fatty acids and adipokines. Adipocytes have a remodeling effect on breast cancer lipid metabolism, while fatty acids and lipid droplets can make breast cancer cells more aggressive. Lipid metabolism, especially the synthesis of fatty acids, is an important cellular process for membrane biosynthesis, energy storage, and signal molecule production. Therefore, blocking the lipid supply to cancer cells or changing the lipid composition has an important impact on the signal transmission and cell proliferation of cancer cells. Alterations in lipid availability can also affect cancer cell migration, induction of angiogenesis, metabolic symbiosis, evasion of immune surveillance, and cancer drug resistance. Fatty acid synthesis and metabolism have received extensive attention as potential targets for cancer therapy, and studies on modulating the tumor lipid microenvironment to improve the sensitivity of antitumor drugs have also been discussed; however, strategies to target these processes have not been translated into clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Preeclampsia is a life-threatening disease of pregnancy that lacks effective pharmaceuticals which can target its pathogenesis. Since preeclampsia involves complex pathological processes, including autophagy, this study aims to explore autophagy-related mechanisms of preeclampsia and to screen potential drugs. Firstly, the datasets GSE75010, GSE24129, GSE66273, and autophagic genes lists were downloaded from public databases. Then, a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was applied to filter autophagic-related hub genes of preeclampsia. The differential expression levels of the hub genes were validated with datasets GSE24129 and GSE66273. Next, the GO and KEGG enrichment, protein-protein interacting (PPI) network, as well as the downstream pathways was analyzed via the starBase, STRING and Cytoscape to determine the functions and regulatory network of the hub genes. Additionally, the immune microenvironment of preeclampsia was investigated by the CIBERSORTX database. Finally, three herb ingredients, berberine, baicalein, and luteolin were screened by molecular docking in comparison to pravastatin, metformin, and aspirin, to predict potential drugs for treating preeclampsia. A total of 54 autophagy-related genes were filtered by WGCNA. After filtering with |GS| &gt; 0.5 and |MM| &gt; 0.8, three hub genes, namely PKM, LEP, and HK2, were identified and validated. Among these genes, PKM and LEP were overexpressed in women older than 35 years old ( p&lt;0.05; p&lt;0.05); the expression of PKM, LEP, and HK2 differed remarkably in women with different BMI (all p&lt;0.05); PKM overexpressed in women with hypertension (p&lt;0.05). The regulatory network of hub genes demonstrated that they were mainly enriched in metabolic pathways, including the AMPK signaling pathway, glucagon signaling pathway, adipocytokine signaling pathway, and central carbon metabolism. Then, immune microenvironment analysis turned out that M2 macrophages were reduced in preeclampsia women (p&lt;0.0001) and were negatively correlated with the expression of PKM (r=-0.2, p&lt;0.05), LEP (r=-0.4, p&lt;0.0001), and HK2 (r=-0.3, p&lt;0.001). Lastly, molecular docking showed baicalein and luteolin could bind intimately to hub genes. PKM, LEP, and HK2 could be promising biomarkers for preeclampsia, which might regulate the pathogenesis of preeclampsia via metabolism pathways and immune microenvironment. Baicalein and luteolin could be potential therapeutics for preeclampsia.",

BAT plays a crucial role in regulating energy expenditure and systemic insulin sensitivity, making it an attractive target for the treatment of obesity and metabolic diseases. Recent research suggests that impaired BAT function and mass may contribute to the link between metabolic disturbances and reproductive issues in PCOS. Additionally, abnormal white adipose tissue (WAT) can exacerbate these conditions by releasing adipokines and nonesterified fatty acids. In this review, we explored the impact of WAT changes on BAT function in PCOS and discussed the potential of BAT activation as a therapeutic strategy to improve PCOS symptoms. We propose that BAT activation holds promise for managing PCOS; however, further research is needed to confirm its efficacy and to develop clinically feasible methods for BAT activation.",

    "abstract": "Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) have shown neuroprotective effects in obese mice. However, whether SGLT2i can ameliorate high-fat diet (HFD)-related ovulation disorders remains unknown. The aim of this research was to investigate whether dapagliflozin improves HFD-induced ovulatory dysfunction by attenuating microglia-mediated hypothalamic inflammation. C57BL/6J female mice fed HFD were treated with dapagliflozin (1 mg/kg) for 22 weeks. Plasma insulin, leptin, luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (E2), and IL-1&#x3b2; levels were also tested. Microglial morphology, cell numbers, and SGLT2 expression were evaluated using immunofluorescence. The expression of IL-1&#x3b2;, NLRP3, kisspeptin, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), SGLT2, insulin, and leptin receptors in the hypothalamus was determined using immunohistochemical staining. We also examined the effects of dapagliflozin on glucose metabolism and the release of inflammatory factor in palmitic acid (PA)-treated HMC3 cells. As expected, dapagliflozin improved HFD-induced metabolic disturbances, peripheral versus central insulin and leptin resistance and also restored the regular estrous cycle. Furthermore, dapagliflozin blunted microglia activation, NLRP3 inflammasome priming, hypothalamic inflammation, and increased the expression of GnRH and kisspeptin at proestrus in the hypothalamus. Additionally, dapagliflozin markedly reduced IL-6 and NO release and fat accumulation, decreased lactic acid production and glucose consumption, and inhibited mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and hexokinase 2 (HK2) expression in PA-treated HMC3 cells. These effects suggest that dapagliflozin reduced the mTOR/HK2-mediated aerobic glycolysis. Dapagliflozin improved HFD-related ovulation disorders by regulating glucose metabolism through mTOR/HK2 signaling and attenuating microglia-mediated hypothalamic inflammation. These results validate the novel role for the neuroprotection of SGLT2i in HFD-induced obesity and ovulation disorders.",

    "title": "The slow-release adiponectin analog ALY688-SR modifies early-stage disease development in the D2.<i>mdx</i> mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.",
    "abstract": "Fibrosis is associated with respiratory and limb muscle atrophy in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Current standard of care partially delays the progression of this myopathy but there remains an unmet need to develop additional therapies. Adiponectin receptor agonism has emerged as a possible therapeutic target to lower inflammation and improve metabolism in mdx mouse models of DMD but the degree to which fibrosis and atrophy are prevented remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the recently developed slow-release peptidomimetic adiponectin analog, ALY688-SR, remodels the diaphragm of murine model of DMD on DBA background (D2.mdx) mice treated from days 7-28 of age during early stages of disease. ALY688-SR also lowered interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA but increased IL-6 and transforming growth factor-&#x3b2;1 (TGF-&#x3b2;1) protein contents in diaphragm, suggesting dynamic inflammatory remodeling. ALY688-SR alleviated mitochondrial redox stress by decreasing complex I-stimulated H2O2 emission. Treatment also attenuated fibrosis, fiber type-specific atrophy, and in vitro diaphragm force production in diaphragm suggesting a complex relationship between adiponectin receptor activity, muscle remodeling, and force-generating properties during the very early stages of disease progression in murine model of DMD on DBA background (D2.mdx) mice. In tibialis anterior, the modest fibrosis at this young age was not altered by treatment, and atrophy was not apparent at this young age. These results demonstrate that short-term treatment of ALY688-SR in young D2.mdx mice partially prevents fibrosis and fiber type-specific atrophy and lowers force production in the more disease-apparent diaphragm in relation to lower mitochondrial redox stress and heterogeneous responses in certain inflammatory markers. These diverse muscle responses to adiponectin receptor agonism in early stages of DMD serve as a foundation for further mechanistic investigations.NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY There are limited therapies for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. As fibrosis involves an accumulation of collagen that replaces muscle fibers, antifibrotics may help preserve muscle function. We report that the novel adiponectin receptor agonist ALY688-SR prevents fibrosis in the diaphragm of D2.mdx mice with short-term treatment early in disease progression. These responses were related to altered inflammation and mitochondrial functions and serve as a foundation for the development of this class of therapy.",

    "title": "Mulberry leaf multi-components exert hypoglycemic effects through regulation of the PI-3K/Akt insulin signaling pathway in type 2 diabetic rats.",
    "abstract": "Phytochemicals have unique advantages in the treatment of diabetes due to their multi-target activity and low toxicity. Mulberry leaves, a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, have been used in the prevention and treatment of diabetes for centuries. The main active ingredients in mulberry leaves with regards to the hypoglycemic effect are 1-deoxynojirimycin, flavonoids, and polysaccharides. However, the combined hypoglycemic effects and mechanisms of mulberry leaf multi-components remain unclear. This study explored the anti-diabetic effects of mulberry leaf multi-components (MMC) and the role of the PI-3K/Akt insulin signalling pathway in improving insulin resistance. The main chemical components of MMC were analyzed using the phenol-sulfuric acid method, aluminum nitrate-sodium nitrite method, and HPLC-ultraviolet/fluorescence detection method. The T2DM rat model was created via feeding a high-fat diet and peritoneal injection of streptozotocin. T2DM rats were divided into four groups: model, model plus metformin, model plus low-dose, and model plus high-dose MMC groups (100 and 200&#xa0;mg/kg body weight/day, respectively), and plus normal group for a total of five groups. MMC was administered by oral gavage for six weeks. Fasting blood glucose and serum lipid profiles were measured using a glucometer and an automatic biochemistry analyzer, respectively. Serum insulin and adipocytokine levels were analyzed by ELISA. Hepatic glucose metabolizing enzyme activity was evaluated by ELISA and the double antibody sandwich method. Expression of PI-3K/Akt signalling pathway proteins was analyzed by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Extracted 1-deoxynojirimycin, flavonoid, and polysaccharide purity was 70.40%, 52.34%, and 32.60%, respectively. These components were then mixed at a ratio of 1:6:8 to form MMC. MMC significantly reduced serum glucose, insulin, and lipid levels. In diabetic rats, MMC enhanced insulin sensitivity and alleviated inflammatory and oxidative damage by lowing adipocytokine levels and increasing anti-oxidative enzyme activity. Insulin resistance was also mitigated. MMC regulated the activity of key downstream enzymes of hepatic glucose metabolism via activating the expression of PI-3K, Akt, PDX-1, and GLUT4 at the mRNA and protein levels, thereby correcting hepatic glucolipid metabolism disorders and exerting a hypoglycemic effect. MMC ameliorated hepatic glucolipid metabolism disorders and improved insulin resistance in T2DM rats by activating the PI-3K/Akt signaling pathway. These results highlight the multi-component, multi-target, and combined effects of MMC, and suggest it may be further developed as a hypoglycemic drug.",

    "title": "Exploring the logic and conducting a comprehensive evaluation of AdipoRon-based adiponectin replacement therapy against hormone-related cancers-a systematic review.",
    "abstract": "The potential benefits of adiponectin replacement therapy extend to numerous human diseases, with current research showing particular interest in its effectiveness against specific cancer forms, especially hormone-related. However, limitations in the pharmacological use of the intact protein have led to a focus on alternative options. AdipoRon is an extensively studied non-peptidic drug candidate for adiponectin replacement therapy. While researchers have explored the efficacy and therapeutic applications of AdipoRon in various disease conditions, their effects against cancer models advanced more, with no review regarding AdipoRon's efficacy against hormone-related cancers being published. The present systematic review aims to fill this gap. Preclinical evidence was compiled from PubMed, EMBASE, COCHRANE, and Google Scholar following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, and the manuscript's quality assessment was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Checklist Critical Appraisal Tool for Systematic Reviews' Quality. The included nine studies incorporated various cell and animal models of the pancreas, gynaecological system, and osteosarcoma cancers. AdipoRon demonstrated effectiveness against pancreatic cancer by activating p44/42 MAPK, mitochondrial dysfunction, and AMPK-mediated inhibition of ACC1. In gynaecological cancers, it exhibited promising anticancer effects through the activation of AMPK, potential inhibition of mTOR, and modulation of the SET1B/BOD1/AdipoR1 signaling cascade. Against osteosarcoma, AdipoRon worked by perturbing ERK1/2 signaling and reducing p70S6K phosphorylation. AdipoRon shows promise in preclinical studies, but human trials are crucial for clinical safety and effectiveness. Caution is needed due to potential off-target effects, especially in cancer therapy with multi-target approaches. Structural biology and computational methods can help predict these effects.",

    "title": "SIRT1 inhibitors within Qing-Luo-Yin alleviated white adipose tissues-mediated inflammation in antigen-induced arthritis mice.",
    "abstract": "White adipose tissues (WAT) release large amounts of inflammatory mediators, which are responsible for the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The current study investigated the involvement of WAT in the treatments of antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) mice with the herbal formula Qing-Luo-Yin (QLY). Cytokines and biochemical/metabolic indicators were determined by ELISA and colorimetry methods, respectively. Monocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry. Tissues were subjected to PCR, western-blot and histological analyses. Pre-adipocytes were cultured in the different mouse serum from the in vivo experiment, and some of them were treated by certain compounds or/and lipopolysaccharide. Afterwards, the catalytic activity and thermostability of SIRT1 were tested. Gene/protein expression and cytokine production were investigated too. NAMPT and SIRT1 were silenced in some cells by siRNA. AIA mice suffered from inflammatory adipokines-mediated metabolism and immune disorders. Besides joint protective effects, QLY therapies favored adipocyte differentiation and suppressed inflammatory adipokines release. The up-regulation of fatty acid oxidation and inflammatory monocyte polarization was therefore inhibited in peripheral tissues. PPAR&#x3b3; expression was generally promoted by QLY. Whereas, SIRT1 activity was always impaired, indicated by the declined NAD<sup>+</sup> levels and the increased ace-p65 expression. QLY effectively inhibited eNAMPT release in AIA mouse serum-cultured pre-adipocytes. This effect was antagonized by resveratrol (a SIRT1 agonist) and overshadowed by NAMPT silencing. QLY-related compounds berberine, dioscin and sophocarpine showed high binding affinities to SIRT1, stabilized this protein, and inhibited its deacetylation activity in vitro. Their effects on ace-p65 expression were weakened when SIRT1 was silenced. SIRT1 inhibitors in QLY reduced eNAMPT production and up-regulated PPAR&#x3b3; in AIA mice, leading to inflammation remission. These clues show that except for the well-known anti-inflammatory functions, SIRT1 participates in inflammatory reactions too and could be a potential anti-rheumatic target.",

    "title": "DHA alleviated hepatic and adipose inflammation with increased adipocyte browning in high-fat diet-induced obese mice.",
    "abstract": "Obesity is associated with accumulation of inflammatory immune cells in white adipose tissue, whereas thermogenic browning adipose tissue is inhibited. Dietary fatty acids are important nutritional components and several clinical and experimental studies have reported beneficial effects of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on obesity-related metabolic changes. In this study, we investigated effects of DHA on hepatic and adipose inflammation and adipocyte browning in high-fat diet-induced obese C57BL/6J mice, and in vitro 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation. Since visceral white adipose tissue has a close link with metabolic abnormality, epididymal adipose tissue represents current target for evaluation. A course of 8-week DHA supplementation improved common phenotypes of obesity, including improvement of insulin resistance, inhibition of macrophage M1 polarization, and preservation of macrophage M2 polarization in hepatic and adipose tissues. Moreover, dysregulated adipokines and impaired thermogenic and browning molecules, considered obesogenic mechanisms, were improved by DHA, along with parallel alleviation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and mitochondrial DNA stress-directed innate immunity. During 3T3-L1 preadipocytes differentiation, DHA treatment decreased lipid droplet accumulation and increased the levels of thermogenic, browning, and mitochondrial biogenesis molecules. Our study provides experimental evidence that DHA mitigates obesity-associated inflammation and induces browning of adipose tissue in visceral epididymal adipose tissue. Since obesity is associated with metabolic abnormalities across tissues, our findings indicate that DHA may have potential as part of a dietary intervention to combat obesity.",

    "title": "<i>Actinidia deliciosa</i> Extract as a Promising Supplemental Agent for Hepatic and Renal Complication-Associated Type 2 Diabetes (In Vivo and In Silico-Based Studies).",
    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic metabolic condition associated with obesity, oxidative stress-mediated inflammation, apoptosis, and impaired insulin signaling. The utilization of phytochemical therapy generated from plants has emerged as a promising approach for the treatment of diabetes and its complications. Kiwifruit is recognized for its substantial content of antioxidative phenolics. Therefore, this work aimed to examine the effect of Actinidia deliciosa (kiwi fruit) on hepatorenal damage in a high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T2D in rats using in vivo and in silico analyses. An increase in hepatic and renal lipid peroxidation was observed in diabetic rats accompanied by a decrease in antioxidant status. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that there were observable inflammatory and apoptotic responses in the hepatic and renal organs of rats with diabetes, along with a dysregulation of the phosphorylation levels of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), protein kinase B (Akt), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling proteins. However, the administration of kiwi extract to diabetic rats alleviated hepatorenal dysfunction, inflammatory processes, oxidative injury, and apoptotic events with activation of the insulin signaling pathway. Furthermore, molecular docking and dynamic simulation studies revealed quercetin, chlorogenic acid, and melezitose as components of kiwi extract that docked well with potential as effective natural products for activating the silent information regulator 1(SIRT-1) pathway. Furthermore, phenolic acids in kiwi extract, especially syringic acid, P-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, and ferulic acid, have the ability to inhibit the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) active site. In conclusion, it can be argued that kiwi extract may present a potentially beneficial adjunctive therapy approach for the treatment of diabetic hepatorenal complications.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of recurrent pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is currently unclear. Therefore, developing targeted preventive measures is difficult. This study identified potential key pathways, crucial genes, comorbidities, and therapeutic targets associated with the occurrence and development of recurrent POP. The original microarray data GSE28660, GSE53868, and GSE12852 were downloaded from the GEO database. Identification and validation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and hub genes associated with recurrent POP were performed using R software and cytoHubba of Cytoscape. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed using the STRING tool and visualized using Cytoscape. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome (KEGG) enrichment analyses were effectively performed using DAVID platforms. In addition, the NetworkAnalyst platform was used to explore and visualize the miRNA-hub gene network, TF-hub gene network, hub gene-disease network, and hub gene-drug/chemical network. A total of 110 DEGs and 6 hub genes (ADIPOQ, IL6, PPARG, CEBPA, LPL, and LIPE) were identified in this study. These genes were primarily enriched in the PPAR, AMPK, and adipocytokine, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and signaling pathways related to glycerol metabolism. Moreover, 96 miRNAs and 97&#xa0;TFs were identified to as being associated with recurrent POP. These genes were closely linked to adipocyte metabolism and distribution, energy metabolism, and the longevity regulatory pathway. In addition, 192 diseases or chronic complications were potentially related to the recurrence of POP, including diabetes, hypertension, obesity, inflammatory diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Furthermore, 954 drugs or compounds were shown to have therapeutic potential for recurrent POP, and the most critical target drugs were dexamethasone, bisphenol A, efavirenz, 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, and estradiol. The results of this study revealed that ADIPOQ, IL6, PPARG, CEBPA, LPL, and LIPE as potential hub genes associated with recurrent POP, and these hub genes may aid in the understanding of the mechanism underlying POP recurrence and the development of potential molecular drugs.",

    "abstract": "The pathophysiology of osteoarthritis (OA) is closely linked to autophagy abnormalities in articular chondrocytes, the sole mature cell type in healthy cartilage. Nevertheless, the precise molecular mechanism remains uncertain. Previous research has demonstrated that leptin activates mTORC1&#xa0;, thereby inhibiting chondrocyte autophagy during the progression of OA. In this study, it is demonstrated that the presence of leptin induces a substantial increase in the expression of STAT3, leading to a notable decrease in REDD1 expression and subsequent phosphorylation of p70S6K, a recognized downstream effector of mTORC1. Conversely, inhibition of leptin yields contrasting effects. Additionally, the potential advantages of utilizing a sustained intra-articular release of a leptin inhibitor (LI) via an injectable, thermosensitive poly(D,L-lactide)-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(D,L-lactide) (PDLLA-PEG-PDLLA: PLEL) hydrogel delivery system for the purpose of investigating its impact on cartilage repair are explored. The study conducted on LI-loaded PLEL (PLEL@LI) demonstrates remarkable efficacy in inhibiting OA and displays encouraging therapeutic advantages in the restoration of subchondral bone and cartilage. These findings establish a solid foundation for the advancement of a pioneering treatment approach utilizing PLEL@LI for OA.",

    "abstract": "Psoriasis is an immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease with a complex etiology involving environmental and genetic factors. Psoriasis patients often require long-term treatment. Shanyaotianua decoction (STT), a typical traditional Chinese medicine prescription, positively affects psoriasis, although its molecular targets remain unknown. To elucidate its molecular mechanisms, a combination of network pharmacology, bioinformatics analysis, and drug similarity comparisons were employed. Participants were separated into 3 groups: non-lesional (NL), lesions after medication (LM), and psoriasis lesion groups (LS). Based on the Gene Ontology/kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes enrichment analyses, the key targets were mainly enriched for biological processes (immuno-inflammatory responses, leukocyte differentiation, lipid metabolic disorders, and viral infection) with the relevant pathways (Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription and adipocytokine signaling and T-helper 17 cell differentiation), thus identifying the possible action mechanism of STT against psoriasis. Target prediction for 18 STT compounds that matched the screening criteria was performed. Then, the STT compounds were intersected with the differentially expressed genes of the psoriatic process, and 5 proteins were potential targets for STT. Based on the open-source toolkit RDKit and DrugBank database, and through molecular docking and drug similarity comparisons, spinasterol, diosgenin, and 24-Methylcholest-5-enyl-3belta-O-glucopyranoside_qt may be potential drugs for psoriasis.",

    "abstract": "The hallmark of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is aberrant buildup of triglycerides (TGs) in hepatocytes. Many genes promote NAFLD development. Using bioinformatics tools, we investigated the possible effect of statins on genes involved in NAFLD progression. Protein interactions of statins and NAFLD were searched in gene-drug and gene-disease databases. A Protein-Protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to find hub genes and Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) of NAFLD-related genes. Shared protein targets between protein targets of statins and NAFLD-associated genes were identified. Next, targets of each statin were assayed with all modular clusters in the MCODEs related to NAFLD. Biological process and pathway enrichment analysis for shared proteins was performed. Screening protein targets for conventional statins and curated NAFLD-related genes identified 343 protein targets and 70 genes, respectively. A Venn diagram of NAFLD-related genes and protein targets of statins showed 24 shared proteins. The biological pathways on KEGG enrichment associated with the 24 shared protein sets were evaluated and included cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, adipocytokine, PPAR, TNF and AMPK signaling pathways. Gene Ontology analysis showed major involvement in lipid metabolic process regulation and inflammatory response. PPI network analysis of 70 protein targets indicated 13 hub genes (PPARA, IL4, CAT, LEP, SREBF1, PRKCA, CYP2E1, NFE2L2, PTEN, NR1H4, ADIPOQ, GSTP1 and TGFB1). Comparing all seven statins with the three MCODE clusterings and 13 hub genes revealed that simvastatin as the most associated statin with NAFLD. Simvastatin has the most impact on NAFLD-related genes versus other statins.",

    "title": "CTRP3 attenuates inflammation, oxidative and cell death in cisplatin induced HK-2 cells.",
    "abstract": "Cisplatin has been widely studied and found to be a highly effective anti-tumor drug. It has several side effects, including acute kidney injury (AKI). Cisplatin-induced AKI can be primarily attributed to oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. The CTRP3 adipokine is a new adipokine that exhibits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties. Despite this, the role of CTRP3 in AKI remain unclear. In cisplatin-induced AKI models, our findings demonstrated that CTRP3 expression was decreased in human proximal tubule epithelial cells (HK-2). In the in vitro experiments, HK-2 cells were first transfected with an overexpression plasmid of CTRP3 (pcDNA-CTRP3) or a small interfering RNA for CTRP3 (si-CTRP3) and induced by cisplatin; and cell oxidative stress, inflammation, proliferation, and apoptosis were found to be present. Overexpressing CTRP3 inhibited oxidative stress through decreasing malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and increasing the activity of SOD and CAT. The mRNA levels of SOD1 and SOD2 were increased in response to CTRP3 overexpression. Additionally, CTRP3 decreased TNF-&#x3b1; and MCP-1 levels. Moreover, CTRP3 overexpression increased cisplatin-induced cell activity and decreased cell apoptosis, as indicated by the elevated numbers of EdU positive cells and decreased numbers of apoptotic cells. Consistent with these results, the overexpression of CTRP3 effectively elevated the mRNA levels of Bcl-2 and reduced the mRNA levels of Bax. In contrast, inhibition of CTRP3 expression by si-CTRP3 reversed the cisplatin-induced indices. Mechanistically, we found that the overexpression of CTRP3 can increase expression of Nrf2 and inhibit the activation of MAPK phosphorylation (ERK, JNK, and p38). Furthermore, inhibition of ERK, JNK and p38 activity eliminated aggravation of cisplatin-induced inflammation and apoptosis caused by CTRP3 knockdown. Additionally, the cisplatin-induced oxidative stress and activation of MAPK phosphorylation (ERK, JNK, and p38) in HK-2 cells were reversed by Nrf2 suppression by siRNA. Collectively, these results indicated that CTRP3 may identify as a novel target for AKI treatment and protect against cisplatin-induced AKI through the Nrf2/MAPK pathway.",

    "abstract": "Obesity has become a worldwide public health problem and continues to be one of the leading causes of chronic diseases. Obesity treatment is challenged by large drug doses, high administration frequencies and severe side effects. Herein, we propose an antiobesity strategy through the local administration of <sup>Ha</sup>RChr fiber rods loaded with chrysin and grafted with hyaluronic acid and <sup>Ats</sup>FRk fiber fragments loaded with raspberry ketone and grafted with adipocyte target sequences (ATSs). The hyaluronic acid grafts double the uptake levels of <sup>Ha</sup>RChr by M1 macrophages to promote phenotype transformation from M1 to M2 through upregulating CD206 and downregulating CD86 expressions. ATS-mediated targeting and sustained release of raspberry ketone from <sup>Ats</sup>FRk increase the secretion of glycerol and adiponectin, and Oil red O staining shows much fewer lipid droplets in adipocytes. The combination treatment with <sup>Ats</sup>FRk and the conditioned media from <sup>Ha</sup>RChr-treated macrophages elevates adiponectin levels, suggesting that M2 macrophages may secrete anti-inflammatory factors to stimulate adipocytes to produce adiponectin. Diet-induced obese mice showed significant weight losses of inguinal (49.7%) and epididymal (32.5%) adipose tissues after <sup>Ha</sup>RChr/<sup>Ats</sup>FRk treatment, but no effect was observed on food intake. <sup>Ha</sup>RChr/<sup>Ats</sup>FRk treatment reduces adipocyte volumes, lowers serum levels of triglycerides and total cholesterol and restores adiponectin levels to those of normal mice. In the meantime, <sup>Ha</sup>RChr/<sup>Ats</sup>FRk treatment significantly elevates the gene expression of adiponectin and interleukin-10 and downregulates tissue necrosis factor-&#x3b1; expression in the inguinal adipose tissues. Thus, local injection of cell-targeting fiber rods and fragments demonstrates a feasible and effective antiobesity strategy through improving lipid metabolism and normalizing the inflammatory microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "Lifestyle changes have made metabolic disorders as one of the major threats to life. Growing evidence demonstrates that obesity and diabetes disrupt the reproductive system by affecting the gonads and the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Apelin, an adipocytokine, and its receptor (APJ) are broadly expressed in the hypothalamus nuclei, such as paraventricular and supraoptic, where gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is released, and all three lobes of the pituitary, indicating that apelin is involved in the control of reproductive function. Moreover, apelin affects food intake, insulin sensitivity, fluid homeostasis, and glucose and lipid metabolisms. This review outlined the physiological effects of the apelinergic system, the relationship between apelin and metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity, as well as the effect of apelin on the reproductive system in both gender. The apelin-APJ system can be considered a potential therapeutic target in the management of obesity-associated metabolic dysfunction and reproductive disorders.",

    "title": "Matriptase as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus.",
    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder that affects the processing of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. In T2DM, metabolic dysregulation occurs through various pathways caused by increased levels of many adipokines and inflammatory chemokines. Impaired insulin-glucose metabolism occurs in tissues. The proteolytic enzyme matriptase is thought to be closely related to glucose metabolism due to its glycolization sites. Our study aimed to evaluate the correlation between matriptase, a proteolytic enzyme, and metabolic parameters in individuals recently diagnosed with T2DM. We also sought to investigate the potential involvement of matriptase in the development of diabetes. We measured all participants' metabolic laboratory parameters, including basic biochemical tests, hemograms, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and matriptase levels. Our results showed a significant increase in circulating matriptase levels in individuals with T2DM compared to the control group. Furthermore, individuals with metabolic syndrome had significantly higher matriptase levels than those without in the T2DM and control groups. We also observed that T2DM patients had elevated levels of Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), hsCRP, and matriptase, which displayed a positive correlation. Our study is the first to report elevated levels of matriptase in individuals with newly diagnosed T2DM and/or metabolic syndrome. Additionally, we found a significant positive correlation between matriptase levels and metabolic and inflammatory parameters, indicating a potential role for matriptase in the pathogenesis of T2DM and glucose metabolism. Further research on matriptase could lead to its recognition as a novel target for investigation.",

    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Type two diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disease with debilitating complications and high mortality. Evidence indicates that good glycemic control delays disease progression and is hence a target of disease management protocols. Nonetheless, some patients cannot maintain glycemic control. This study aimed to investigate the association between serum leptin levels and several SNPs of the LEP gene with the lack of glycemic control in T2DM patients on metformin therapy. Materials and Methods: In a hospital-based case-control study, 170 patients with poor glycemic control and 170 patients with good glycemic control were recruited. Serum leptin was measured. Patients were genotyped for three SNPs in the LEP gene (rs7799039, rs2167270, and rs791620). Results: Serum leptin was significantly lower in T2DM patients with poor glycemic control (p &lt; 0.05). In multivariate analysis, serum leptin levels significantly lowered the risk of having poor glycemic control (OR = 0.985; CI: 0.976-0.994; p = 0.002); moreover, the GA genotype of rs2167270 was protective against poor glycemic control compared to the GG genotype (OR = 0.417; CI: 0.245-0.712; p = 0.001). Conclusions: Higher serum leptin and the GA genotype of the rs2167270 SNP of the LEP gene were associated with good glycemic control in T2DM patients on metformin therapy. Further studies with a larger sample size from multiple institutions are required to validate the findings.",

The insufficient efficacy of current management strategies for insulin resistance calls for additional therapeutic options. The preponderance of evidence suggests potential beneficial effects of curcumin on insulin resistance, while modern science provides a scientific basis for its potential applications against the disease. Curcumin combats insulin resistance by increasing the levels of circulating irisin and adiponectin, activating PPAR&#x3b3;, suppressing Notch1 signalling, and regulating SREBP target genes, among others. In this review, we bring together the diverse areas pertaining to our current understanding of the potential benefits of curcumin on insulin resistance, associated mechanistic insights, and new therapeutic possibilities.",

    "abstract": "Adipose tissue engineering plays a key role in the reconstruction of soft-tissue defects. The acellular adipose matrix (AAM) is a promising biomaterial for the construction of engineered adipose tissue. However, AAM lacks sufficient adipoinduction potency because of the abundant loss of matrix-bound adipokines during decellularization. An adipose-derived extracellular matrix collagen scaffold, adipose collagen fragment (ACF), was prepared using a novel mechanical method that provides sustained release of adipokines. Here, the authors used label-free proteomics methods to detect the protein components in AAM and ACF. In vivo, ACF was incorporated into AAM or acellular dermal matrix and implanted into nude mice to evaluate adipogenesis. Neoadipocytes, neovessels, and corresponding gene expression were evaluated. The effects of ACF on adipogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells and tube formation by human umbilical vein endothelial cells were tested in vitro. Proteomics analysis showed that ACF contains diverse adipogenic and angiogenic proteins. ACF can release diverse adipokines and induce highly vascularized, mature adipose tissue in AAM, and even in nonadipogenic acellular dermal matrix. Higher expression of adipogenic markers peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha and greater numbers of tubule structures were observed in ACF-treated groups in vitro. The combination of ACF and AAM could serve as a novel and promising strategy to construct mature, vascularized adipose tissue for soft-tissue reconstruction. The combined use of AAM and ACF has been proven to induce a highly vascularized, mature, engineered adipose tissue in the nude mouse model, which may serve as a promising strategy for soft-tissue reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Low-grade inflammation, a common feature of both diabetes and periodontitis, partly accounts for the complexity and refractoriness of diabetes-associated periodontitis. Adiponectin (APN), the most abundant adipokine in human blood, has been widely reported to have anti-inflammatory functions. Herein, we investigated the ability of an APN receptor agonist, AdipoAI, to alleviate diabetes-associated periodontitis. Furthermore, we revealed the possible mechanism underlying its anti-inflammatory effects. The maxillary first molar of Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats was ligated to construct a diabetes-associated periodontitis model, and rats were administered AdipoAI by gavage. We examined diabetes-related indexes, pathological changes in insulin target organs, alveolar bone resorption and systemic and local inflammation. In vitro, transwell assays were used to evaluate monocyte/macrophage migration induced by human gingival fibroblasts (hGFs) with/without AdipoAI treatment. Additionally, we examined chemokine expression levels in hGFs and hGF-induced monocyte/macrophage migration upon siRNA knockdown of Adiponectin receptor expression. Expression of Adipo1/Adipo2 receptors and inflammation-related signalling pathways were examined by IHC and WB, followed by confirmation with an NF-&#x3ba;B P65 inhibitor (BAY 11-7082). AdipoAI lowered fasting blood glucose and serum insulin in ZDF rats and alleviated inflammation in insulin target tissues. Locally, AdipoAI reduced alveolar bone absorption and gingival inflammation. Mechanistically, AdipoAI inhibited hGF-induced monocyte/macrophage migration by reducing CCL2 secretion. In hGFs, AdipoAI attenuated LPS-induced activation of NF-&#x3ba;B P65 and CCL2 expression, which was dependent on the Adipo receptor 1. AdipoAI, with its ability to alleviate inflammatory damage in tissues, is a candidate for diabetes-associated periodontitis treatment.",

    "abstract": "Ginkgo Folium has a favorable effect on non-alcoholic fatty live disease (NAFLD), but its mechanism remains unclear. The aim of this study is to reveal the underlying mechanism of Ginkgo Folium in the treatment of NAFLD. Ingredients of Ginkgo Folium and ingredients-related genes were collected from TCMSP database and SwissTargetPrediction website, respectively. Genecards database was used to obtain NAFLD-related genes. Next, the protein-protein interaction network and key ingredients-genes network were constructed via Cytoscape3.7.0. Based on the Metascape website, gene ontology function analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis were carried out for key genes. Finally, molecular docking was performed to present the interaction between components and genes using AutoDock Vina 1.1.2. Eighteen active ingredients and 10 target genes were screened from Ginkgo Folium. AKT1, TNF, EGFR, PTGS2, MAPK8, PPA&#x3b3;, APP, ESR1, HIF&#x3b1; and PPA&#x3b1; were considered as potential therapeutic targets. These target genes were mainly enriched in insulin resistance, HIF-1, adipocytokine and AMPK signaling pathways. Molecular docking results suggested that Ginkgo Folium active ingredients including luteolin-4'-glucoside, sesamin, luteolin, chryseriol, isorhamnetin and laricitrin showed strong binding capacities with AKT1. The study showed that multi-components in Ginkgo Folium interacted with AKT1 and regulated AKT-AMPK/HIF pathway to alleviate NAFLD. Our findings provided an essential role and basis for new anti-NAFLD drug discovery and further research on Ginkgo Folium.",

This study investigates in-depth the role of leptin and chosen cytokines in the development of malnutrition-inflammation syndrome (MIS) and erythropoietin resistance. Eighty-one hemodialyzed patients with erythropoietin-treated anemia were enrolled in the study. Their body composition was measured. Erythropoietin resistance index was calculated. Blood samples for leptin, IL-6, IL-18, TNF-alpha, and IL-1-alpha serum levels were drawn. Leptin showed negative correlation with erythropoietin resistance index (ERI), whilst IL-6 showed the opposite. IL-6 seemed to be linked more to HD parameters and vintage, while TNF-alpha and leptin were more dependent on body composition. IL-18 and IL-1-alpha did not affect nutritional parameters nor ERI. Modulation of adipokine- and cytokine-related signaling is a promising target in tempering malnutrition in hemodialyzed, and thus achieving better outcomes in anemia treatment. Large clinical studies that target the inflammatory response in hemodialysis, especially regarding IL-6, TNF-alpha, and leptin, would be of great worth.",

    "abstract": "The diabetic population has been increasing in the past decades and diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), a pathology that is defined by the presence of cardiac remodeling and dysfunction without conventional cardiac risk factors such as hypertension and coronary heart diseases, would eventually lead to fatal heart failure in the absence of effective treatment. Impaired insulin signaling, commonly known as insulin resistance, plays an important role in the development of DCM. A family of integral membrane proteins named caveolins (mainly caveolin-1 and caveolin-3 in the myocardium) and a protein hormone adiponectin (APN) have all been shown to be important for maintaining normal insulin signaling. Abnormalities in caveolins and APN have respectively been demonstrated to cause DCM. This review aims to summarize recent research findings of the roles and mechanisms of caveolins and APN in the development of DCM, and also explore the possible interplay between caveolins and APN.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin and leptin are major adipocytokines that control crosstalk between adipose tissue and other organ systems. Hypoadiponectinemia and hypoleptinemia are associated with human metabolic diseases. Compounds with adipocytokine biosynthesis-stimulating activities could be developed as therapeutics against diverse metabolic conditions. In phenotypic screening with human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs), (E)-4-hydroxy-3-(3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)acryloyl)-6-methyl-2H-pyran-2-one (1) was identified to increase adiponectin biosynthesis during adipogenesis and simultaneously to stimulate leptin production. Using the compound 1 structure, the structure-activity relationship study was performed to discover more potent compounds stimulating both adiponectin and leptin production. (E)-3-(3-(2-fluoropyridin-4-yl)acryloyl)-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-2H-pyran-2-one (11) exhibited the most potent adiponectin (EC50, 2.87&#xa0;&#x3bc;M) and leptin (EC50, 2.82&#xa0;&#x3bc;M) biosynthesis-stimulating activities in hBM-MSCs. In a target identification study, compound 11 was characterized as a dual modulator binding to both peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) &#x3b3; and glucocorticoid receptor (GR). This study provides a novel pharmacophore for PPAR&#x3b3;/GR dual modulators with therapeutic potential against human metabolic diseases.",

    "title": "Soy isoflavone ameliorated the alterations in circulating adipokines and microRNAs of mice fed a high-fat diet.",
    "abstract": "Soy protein, containing isoflavones and bioactive peptides, is shown to have anti-obesity effects, but the main contributor and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Recent studies have demonstrated that circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) act as important mediators in obesity and metabolic processes. In this study, we investigated whether soy protein components have distinctive effects on adiposity and circulating miRNA profiles in obese mice. C57BL/6J mice were divided into 4 groups, and each group was fed with a control, high-fat (HF), HF with low-isoflavone soy protein (HF/S), or HF with high-isoflavone soy protein (HF/SI) diet for 16 weeks. In the HF/SI group, changes in the serum adipokine levels, adipocyte diameter, and the number of crown-like structures (CLS) were alleviated compared to those of the HF group. In the HF/S group, the number of CLS was reduced. Decreases in body and adipose tissue weights were not observed in both HF/S and HF/SI groups. Through microarray analysis of serum miRNAs, we identified 23 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) among the groups. The levels of most circulating DEMs were correlated with body weight, serum biochemical parameters, and adipose tissue histology. Functional analysis of predicted target genes of DEMs from both HF vs. CON and HF/S vs. CON comparisons revealed several cancer-related pathways. Only 2 DEMs were identified in the HF/SI vs. CON comparison. In conclusion, the present study confirmed that soy isoflavones are the main contributor to the health-beneficial effects of soy protein in diet-induced obesity. Notably, the extent of serum miRNA dysregulation coincided with obesity and altered the circulating adipokine levels. These findings provide additional insights into the role of soy protein in the regulation of circulating miRNAs in diet-induced obesity. Further work is required to validate the proposed functions of miRNAs in target tissues.",

    "abstract": "Visfatin is an adipocytokine that has been demonstrated to be involved in cardiovascular diseases. This study aims at determining the role of visfatin in sepsis-induced cardiac injury and identify its possible mechanisms. Dynamic changes in visfatin expression in mice with lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced septicemia were measured. Additionally, mice were pretreated with visfatin and further administered LPS to observe the effects of visfatin on cardiac injury. Finally, septic mice were also pretreated with JSH-23 to investigate whether visfatin regulates cardiac injury via the NF-&#x3ba;B p65 pathway. Visfatin expression levels in both the heart and serum were increased in LPS-treated mice and peaked at 6 hours, and visfatin was derived from cardiac macrophages. In septic mice, pretreatment with visfatin reduced the survival rate, worsened cardiac dysfunction, and increased the expression of cardiac injury markers, including creatine kinase myocardial bound (CK-MB) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Treatment with visfatin also increased the infiltration of CD3+ cells and F4/80+ cells, amplified the cardiac inflammatory response, and elevated myocardial cell apoptosis. Treatment with JSH-23 reversed the effects of visfatin in septic mice. This study showed that visfatin amplifies the cardiac inflammatory response and aggravates cardiac injury through the p65 signaling pathway. Visfatin may be a clinical target for preventing cardiac injury in sepsis.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devasting neurodegenerative disease with no cure to date. Therapeutic agents used to treat ALS are very limited, although combined therapies may offer a more effective treatment strategy. Herein, we have studied the potential of nanomedicine to prepare a single platform based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) for the treatment of an ALS animal model with a cocktail of agents such as leptin (neuroprotective) and pioglitazone (anti-inflammatory), which have already demonstrated promising therapeutic ability in other neurodegenerative diseases. Our goal is to study the potential of functionalized mesoporous materials as therapeutic agents against ALS using MSNs as nanocarriers for the proposed drug cocktail leptin/pioglitazone (MSN-LEP-PIO). The nanostructured materials have been characterized by different techniques, which confirmed the incorporation of both agents in the nanosystem. Subsequently, the effect, in vivo, of the proposed drug cocktail, MSN-LEP-PIO, was used in the murine model of TDP-43 proteinopathy (TDP-43<sup>A315T</sup> mice). Body weight loss was studied, and using the rotarod test, motor performance was assessed, observing a continuous reduction in body weight and motor coordination in TDP-43<sup>A315T</sup> mice and wild-type (WT) mice. Nevertheless, the disease progression was slower and showed significant improvements in motor performance, indicating that TDP-43<sup>A315T</sup> mice treated with MSN-LEP-PIO seem to have less energy demand in the late stage of the symptoms of ALS. Collectively, these results seem to indicate the efficiency of the systems in vivo and the usefulness of their use in neurodegenerative models, including ALS.",

    "abstract": "Postbiotics, including bacterial lysates, are considered alternatives to probiotics. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of bacterial lysates (BLs) extracted from Pediococcus acidilactici K10 (K10 BL) and P. acidilactici HW01 (HW01 BL) on the differentiation of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes. Both K10 and HW01 BLs significantly reduced the accumulation of lipid droplets and the amounts of cellular glycerides in 3T3-L1 cells (p &lt; 0.05). However, another postbiotic molecule, peptidoglycan of P. acidilactici K10 and P. acidilactici HW01, moderately inhibited the accumulation of lipid droplets, whereas heat-killed P. acidilactici did not effectively inhibit the lipid accumulation. The mRNA and protein levels of the transcription factors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x3b3; and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein &#x3b1;, responsible for the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, were significantly inhibited by K10 BL and HW01 BL (p &lt; 0.05). Both K10 and HW01 BLs decreased adipocyte-related molecules, adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein and lipoprotein lipase, at the mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, both K10 and HW01 BLs also downregulated the mRNA expression of leptin, but not resistin. Taken together, these results suggest that P. acidilactici BLs mediate anti-adipogenic effects by inhibiting adipogenic-related transcription factors and their target molecules.",

    "abstract": "During chronic SIV/HIV infection, adipose tissue (AT) is the target of both antiretroviral treatment (ART) and the virus. AT might subsequently contribute to the low-grade systemic inflammation observed in patients on ART. To evaluate the inflammatory profile of AT during chronic SIV/HIV infection, we assayed subcutaneous and visceral abdominal AT from non-infected (SIV-, control), ART-na&#xef;ve SIV-infected (SIV+) and ART-controlled SIV-infected (SIV+ART+) cynomolgus macaques for the mRNA expression of genes coding for factors related to inflammation. Significant differences were observed only when comparing the SIV+ART+ group with the SIV+ and/or SIV- groups. ART-treated infection impacted the metabolic fraction (with elevated expression of PPAR&#x3b3; and CEBP&#x3b1;), the extracellular matrix (with elevated expression of COL1A2 and HIF-1&#x3b1;), and the inflammatory profile. Both pro- and anti-inflammatory signatures were detected in AT, with greater mRNA expression of anti-inflammatory markers (adiponectin and CD163) and markers associated with inflammation (TNF-&#x3b1;, Mx1, CCL5 and CX3CL1). There were no intergroup differences in other markers (IL-6 and MCP-1). In conclusion, we observed marked differences in the immune and metabolic profiles of AT in the context of an ART-treated, chronic SIV infection; these differences were related more to ART than to SIV infection per se.",

    "title": "RLIP: A necessary transporter protein for translating oxidative stress into pro-obesity and pro-carcinogenic signaling.",
    "abstract": "Previously, we showed that knockout mice homozygous for deficiency of the mercapturic acid pathway (MAP) transporter protein, RLIP (RLIP<sup>-/-</sup>), are resistant to chemical carcinogenesis, inflammation, and metabolic syndrome (MetS). We also found that RLIP<sup>-/-</sup> mice are highly resistant to obesity caused by a high-fat diet (HFD). Interestingly, these studies showed that kinase, cytokine, and adipokine signaling that are characteristics of obesity were blocked despite the presence of increased oxidative stress in RLIP<sup>-/-</sup> mice. The deficiencies in obesity-inducing kinase, cytokine, and adipokine signaling were attributable to a lack of clathrin-dependent endocytosis (CDE), a process that is severely deficient in RLIP<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Because CDE is also necessary for carcinogenic signaling through EGF, WNT, TGF&#x3b2; and other cancer-specific peptide hormones, and because RLIP<sup>-/-</sup> mice are cancer-resistant, we reasoned that depletion of RLIP by an antisense approach should cause cancer regression in human cancer xenografts. This prediction has been confirmed in studies of xenografts from lung, kidney, prostate, breast, and pancreatic cancers and melanoma. Because these results suggested an essential role for RLIP in carcinogenesis, and because our studies have also revealed a direct interaction between p53 and RLIP, we reasoned that if RLIP played a central role in carcinogenesis, that development of lymphoma in p53<sup>-/-</sup> mice, which normally occurs by the time these mice are 6&#xa0;months old, could be delayed or prevented by depleting RLIP. Recent studies described herein have confirmed this hypothesis, showing complete suppression of lymphomagenesis in p53<sup>-/-</sup> mice treated with anti-RLIP antisense until the age of 8&#xa0;months. All control mice developed lymphoma in the thymus or testis as expected. These findings lead to a novel paradigm predicting that under conditions of increased oxidative stress, the consequent increased flux of metabolites in the MAP causes a proportional increase in the rate of CDE. Because CDE inhibits insulin and TNF signaling but promotes EGF, TGF&#x3b2;, and Wnt signaling, our model predicts that chronic stress-induced increases in RLIP (and consequently CDE) will induce insulin-resistance and enhance predisposition to cancer. Alternatively, generalized depletion of RLIP would antagonize the growth of malignant cells, and concomitantly exert therapeutic insulin-sensitizing effects. Therefore, this review focuses on how targeted depletion or inhibition of RLIP could provide a novel target for treating both obesity and cancer.",

    "abstract": "Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a typical member of the PTP family, considered a direct negative regulator of several receptor and receptor-associated tyrosine kinases. This widely localized enzyme has been involved in the pathophysiology of several diseases. More recently, PTP1B has attracted attention in the field of neuroscience, since its activation in brain cells can lead to schizophrenia-like behaviour deficits, anxiety-like effects, neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation and depression. Conversely, PTP1B inhibition has been shown to prevent microglial activation, thus exerting a potent anti-inflammatory effect and has also shown potential to increase the cognitive process through the stimulation of hippocampal insulin, leptin and BDNF/TrkB receptors. Notwithstanding, most research on the clinical efficacy of targeting PTP1B has been developed in the field of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (TD2M). However, despite the link existing between these metabolic alterations and neurodegeneration, no clinical trials assessing the neurological advantages of PTP1B inhibition have been performed yet. Preclinical studies, though, have provided strong evidence that targeting PTP1B could allow to reach different pathophysiological mechanisms at once. herefore, specific interventions or trials should be designed to modulate PTP1B activity in brain, since it is a promising strategy to decelerate or prevent neurodegeneration in aged individuals, among other neurological diseases. The present paper fails to include all neurological conditions in which PTP1B could have a role; instead, it focuses on those which have been related to metabolic alterations and neurodegenerative processes. Moreover, only preclinical data is discussed, since clinical studies on the potential of PTP1B inhibition for treating neurological diseases are still required.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have demonstrated the antitumor activity of rosiglitazone (RGZ) in cancer cells, including breast cancer cells. However, the molecular targets of RGZ in the inhibition of angiogenesis in breast cancer cells remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the potential targets of RGZ in inhibiting breast cancer angiogenesis using bioinformatics-based analysis. Venn diagram analysis revealed 29 TR proteins. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that TR regulated the adipocytokine, AMPK, and PPAR signaling pathways. Oncoprint analysis showed genetic alterations in FABP4 (14%), ADIPOQ (2.9%), PPARG (2.8%), PPARGC1A (1.5%), CD36 (1.7%), and CREBBP (11%) in patients with breast cancer in a TCGA study. The mRNA levels of FABP4, ADIPOQ, PPARG, CD36, and PPARGC1A were significantly lower in patients with breast cancer than in those without breast cancer. Analysis of gene expression using bc-GenExMiner showed that the mRNA levels of FABP, ADIPOQ, PPARG, CD36, PPARGC1A, and CREBBP were significantly lower in basal-like and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells than in non-basal-like and non-TNBC cells. In general, the protein levels of these genes were low, except for that of CREBBP. Patients with breast cancer who had low mRNA levels of FABP4, ADIPOQ, PPARG, and PPARGC1A had lower overall survival rates than those with high mRNA levels, which was supported by the overall survival related to DNA methylation. Correlation analysis of immune cell infiltration with TR showed a correlation between TR and immune cell infiltration, highlighting the potential of RGZ for immunotherapy. This study explored the potential targets of RGZ as antiangiogenic agents in breast cancer therapy and highlighted FABP4, ADIPOQ, PPARG, PPARGC1A, CD36, and CREBBP as potential targets of RGZ. These findings require further validation to explore the potential of RGZ as an antiangiogenic agent.",

    "title": "Therapeutic effects of the gold nanoparticle on obesity-triggered neuroinflammation: a review.",
    "abstract": "Introduction: Obesity is considered a chronic non-communicable disease characterised by excess body fat. In recent years the prevalence of obesity has grown a lot. Individuals with obesity store the excess of nutrients consumed in the form of fat in adipose tissue, and generate an imbalance of this tissue, where there is the secretion of adipocytokines, which contributes to a peripheral and central inflammatory picture, reaching the central nervous system (CNS), generating neuroinflammation. There is still no effective and safe therapy for the treatment of obesity, many of the drugs marketed has serious side effects. Therefore, there is a search for therapies aimed mainly at reducing inflammation.Objective: In this work the possibility of using a new therapeutic option for obesity will be explored, using nanotechnology. Nanotechnology has gained prominence in recent years for being a promising technology for treatment and as a molecule-in-the-light in inflammatory diseases. Gold nanoparticles (GNP) stand out among nanomaterials because they demonstrate anti-inflammatory characteristics by various pathways, and have been widely used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, including in the CNS, demonstrating excellent results.Result: Thus, the use of GNP for the treatment of obesity is promising due to the inflammatory state of obesity, thus acting as anti-inflammatory at the peripheral and central levels.",

    "title": "Therapeutic Target Analysis and Molecular Mechanism of Melatonin - Treated Leptin Resistance Induced Obesity: A Systematic Study of Network Pharmacology.",
    "abstract": "Obesity is a medical problem with an increased risk for other metabolic disorders like diabetes, heart problem, arthritis, etc. Leptin is an adipose tissue-derived hormone responsible for food intake, energy expenditure, etc., and leptin resistance is one of the significant causes of obesity. Excess leptin secretion by poor diet habits and impaired hypothalamic leptin signaling leads to LR. Melatonin a sleep hormone; also possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The melatonin can attenuate the complications of obesity by regulating its targets towards LR induced obesity. The aim of this study includes molecular pathway and network analysis by using a systems pharmacology approach to identify a potential therapeutic mechanism of melatonin on leptin resistance-induced obesity. The bioinformatic methods are used to find therapeutic targets of melatonin in the treatment of leptin resistance-induced obesity. It includes target gene identification using public databases, Gene ontology, and KEGG pathway enrichment by 'ClusterProfiler' using the R language, network analysis by Cytoscape, and molecular Docking by Autodock. We obtained the common top 33 potential therapeutic targets of melatonin and LR-induced obesity from the total melatonin targets 254 and common LR obesity targets 212 using the data screening method. They are involved in biological processes related to sleep and obesity, including the cellular response to external stimulus, chemical stress, and autophagy. From a total of 180 enriched pathways, we took the top ten pathways for further analysis, including lipid and atherosclerosis, endocrine, and AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications. The top 10 pathways interacted with the common 33 genes and created two functional modules. Using Cytoscape network analysis, the top ten hub genes (TP53, AKT1, MAPK3, PTGS2, TNF, IL6, MAPK1, ERBB2, IL1B, MTOR) were identified by the MCC algorithm of the CytoHubba plugin. From a wide range of pathway classes, melatonin can reduce LR-induced obesity risks by regulating the major six classes. It includes signal transduction, endocrine system, endocrine and metabolic disease, environmental adaptation, drug resistance antineoplastic, and cardiovascular disease.

    "title": "The promise of new anti-obesity therapies arising from knowledge of genetic obesity traits.",
    "abstract": "Obesity is a multifactorial and complex disease that often manifests in early childhood with a lifelong burden. Polygenic and monogenic obesity are driven by the interaction between genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Polygenic variants are frequent and confer small effect sizes. Rare monogenic obesity syndromes are caused by defined pathogenic variants in single genes with large effect sizes. Most of these genes are involved in the central nervous regulation of body weight; for example, genes of the leptin-melanocortin pathway. Clinically, patients with monogenic obesity present with impaired satiety, hyperphagia and pronounced food-seeking behaviour in early childhood, which leads to severe early-onset obesity. With the advent of novel pharmacological treatment options emerging for monogenic obesity syndromes that target the central melanocortin pathway, genetic testing is recommended for patients with rapid weight gain in infancy and additional clinical suggestive features. Likewise, patients with obesity associated with hypothalamic damage or other forms of syndromic obesity involving energy regulatory circuits could benefit from these novel pharmacological treatment options. Early identification of patients affected by syndromic obesity will lead to appropriate treatment, thereby preventing the development of obesity sequelae, avoiding failure of conservative treatment approaches and alleviating stigmatization of patients and their families.",

    "title": "Weight Gain after Treatment of Thyroid Dysfunction and Thyroid Surgery.",
    "abstract": "Thyroid surgery is generally recommended for malignant conditions and for some benign thyroid disorders. Many patients report weight gain after thyroidectomy especially during the first months following surgery. Studies on patients with Graves' disease treated either with antithyroid drugs or radioiodine confirm that these patients frequently gain weight after restoration of thyroid function. Other studies have also shown that there is considerable weight gain after thyroidectomy for both nodular goiter and thyroid cancer. Transient hypothyroidism during the postoperative period is often thought to be associated with weight gain after thyroidectomy. The role of a number of adipocytokines and their interaction with the thyroid function has been investigated in the pathogenesis of weight changes. Levothyroxine replacement or suppressive therapy after thyroidectomy has a different impact on the metabolic parameters independent of TSH levels. The long-term effects of the impaired T3/T4 ratio are not fully understood as there are no sensitive markers to assess the biological response of target organs and tissues. Future studies are needed to identify such parameters, provide new considerations for the treatment of patients after total thyroidectomy, and help determine individual target hormone levels to ensure a sustained euthyroid state.",

    "abstract": "The centenary of insulin discovery represents an important opportunity to transform diabetes from a fatal diagnosis into a medically manageable chronic condition. Insulin is a key peptide hormone and mediates the systemic glucose metabolism in different tissues. Insulin resistance (IR) is a disordered biological response for insulin stimulation through the disruption of different molecular pathways in target tissues. Acquired conditions and genetic factors have been implicated in IR. Recent genetic and biochemical studies suggest that the dysregulated metabolic mediators released by adipose tissue including adipokines, cytokines, chemokines, excess lipids and toxic lipid metabolites promote IR in other tissues. IR is associated with several groups of abnormal syndromes that include obesity, diabetes, metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), cardiovascular disease, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and other abnormalities. Although no medication is specifically approved to treat IR, we summarized the lifestyle changes and pharmacological medications that have been used as efficient intervention to improve insulin sensitivity. Ultimately, the systematic discussion of complex mechanism will help to identify potential new targets and treat the closely associated metabolic syndrome of IR.",

    "title": "Inhibition of visfatin alleviates sepsis-induced intestinal damage by inhibiting Hippo signaling pathway.",
    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to investigate role of Visfatin, one of the pro-inflammatory adipokines, in sepsis-induced intestinal injury and to clarify the potential mechanism. C57BL/6 mice underwent cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) surgery to establish sepsis model in vivo. Intestinal epithelial cells were stimulated with LPS to mimic sepsis-induced intestinal injury in vitro. FK866 (the inhibitor of Visfatin) with or without XMU-MP-1 (the inhibitor of Hippo signaling) was applied for treatment. The expression levels of Visfatin, NF-&#x3ba;B and Hippo signaling pathways-related proteins were detected by western blot or immunohistochemistry. The intestinal cell apoptosis and intestinal injury were investigated by TUNEL staining and H&amp;E staining, respectively. ELISA was used to determine the production of inflammatory cytokines. The expression of Visfatin increased in CLP mice. FK866 reduced intestinal pathological injury, inflammatory cytokines production, and intestinal cell apoptosis in sepsis mice. Meanwhile, FK866 affected NF-&#x3ba;B and Hippo signaling pathways. Additionally, the effects of FK866 on inflammatory response, apoptosis, Hippo signaling and NF-&#x3ba;B signaling were partly abolished by XMU-MP-1, the inhibitor of Hippo signaling. In vitro experiments also revealed that FK866 exhibited a protective role against LPS-induced inflammatory response and apoptosis in intestinal cells, as well as regulating NF-&#x3ba;B and Hippo signaling, whereas addition of XMU-MP-1 weakened the protective effects of FK866. In short, this study demonstrated that inhibition of Visfatin might alleviate sepsis-induced intestinal injury through Hippo signaling pathway, supporting a further research on Visfatin as a therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Cerulein&#x2011;induced pancreatitis resembles human acute pancreatitis in terms of pathological events, such as enzymatic activation and inflammatory cell infiltration in the pancreas. Cerulein is a cholecystokinin analog that increases levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and interleukin&#x2011;6 (IL&#x2011;6) expression level in pancreatic acinar cells. Serum levels of resistin, which is secreted from adipocytes, are reportedly higher in patients with acute pancreatitis than in healthy individuals. Previously, it was shown that the adipokine resistin can aggravate the cerulein&#x2011;induced increase in ROS levels and IL&#x2011;6 expression level in pancreatic acinar cells. Peroxisome proliferator&#x2011;activated receptor&#x2011;gamma (PPAR&#x2011;&#x3b3;) is a key regulator of the transcription and expression of antioxidant enzymes, including heme oxygenase 1 (HO&#x2011;1) and catalase. &#x3b1;&#x2011;lipoic acid, a naturally occurring dithiol antioxidant, can prevent cerulein&#x2011;induced pancreatic damage in rats. In the present study, it was aimed to investigate whether &#x3b1;&#x2011;lipoic acid can attenuate the cerulein/resistin&#x2011;induced increase in IL&#x2011;6 expression and ROS levels via PPAR&#x2011;&#x3b3; activation in pancreatic acinar AR42J cells. The anti&#x2011;inflammatory mechanism of &#x3b1;&#x2011;lipoic acid was determined using reverse transcription&#x2011;quantitative PCR, western blot analysis, enzyme&#x2011;linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescence staining and fluorometry. Treatment with cerulein and resistin increased ROS levels and IL&#x2011;6 expression level, which were inhibited by &#x3b1;&#x2011;lipoic acid in pancreatic acinar cells. &#x3b1;&#x2011;lipoic acid increased the nuclear translocation and expression level of PPAR&#x2011;&#x3b3; and the expression levels of its target genes: HO&#x2011;1 and catalase. The PPAR&#x2011;&#x3b3; antagonist GW9662 and HO&#x2011;1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin reversed the inhibitory effect of &#x3b1;&#x2011;lipoic acid on cerulein/resistin&#x2011;induced increase in ROS and IL&#x2011;6 levels. In conclusion, &#x3b1;&#x2011;lipoic acid inhibits the cerulein/resistin&#x2011;induced increase in ROS production and IL&#x2011;6 expression levels by activating PPAR&#x2011;&#x3b3; and inducing the expression of HO&#x2011;1 and catalase in pancreatic acinar cells.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the genetic variants related to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and its metabolic complications in girls born small for gestational age (SGA). Retrospective birth cohort study. We evaluated 66 women of reproductive age born at term (37-42&#xa0;weeks of gestational age) according to the birth weight in relation to gestational age: 26 SGA and 40 AGA (Adequate for gestational age). Anthropometric and biochemical characteristics were measured, as well as the PCOS prevalence. We analyzed 48 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with PCOS and its comorbidities using TaqMan Low-Density Array (TLDA). miRNet and STRING databases were used to predict target and disease networks. Anthropometric and biochemical characteristics did not differ between the SGA and AGA groups, as well as insulin resistance and PCOS prevalence. Two SNPs were not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the rs2910164 (MIR146A C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;G) and rs182052 (ADIPOQ G&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A). The rs2910164 minor allele frequency (MAF) was increased in SGA (OR, 2.77; 95%; CI, 1.22-6.29), while the rs182052 was increased AGA (OR, 0.34; 95%; CI, 0.13 - 0.88). The alleles related to reduced miRNA-146a (C) and ADIPOQ (A) activity showed increased frequency in SGA. The mature miR-146a targets 319 genes, been the CXCR4, TMEM167A and IF144L common targets and contributes to PCOS. The ADIPOQ main protein interactions were ERP44, PPARGCIA and CDH13. The miR-146a (rs2910164) and ADIPOQ (rs182052) allelic variants are related to birth weight in SGA and may predict health-related outcomes, such as PCOS and obesity risk.",

    "abstract": "Shen Qi Wan (SQW) prescription has been used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) for thousands of years, but its pharmacological mechanism is still unclear. The network pharmacology method was used to reveal the potential pharmacological mechanism of SQW in the treatment of T2DM in this study. Nine core targets were identified through protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, which were AKT1, INSR, SLC2A1, EGFR, PPARG, PPARA, GCK, NOS3, and PTPN1. Besides, this study found that SQW treated the T2DM through insulin resistance (has04931), insulin signaling pathway (has04910), adipocytokine signaling pathway (has04920), AMPK signaling pathway (has04152) and FoxO signaling pathway (has04068) via ingredient-hub target-pathway network analysis. Finally, molecular docking was used to verify the drug-target interaction network in this research. This study provides a certain explanation for treating T2DM by SQW prescription, and provides a certain angle and method for researchers to study the mechanism of TCM in the treatment of complex diseases.

    "abstract": "In our previous study, we reported that arginyl-fructose (AF), one of the Amadori rearrangement compounds (ARCs) produced by the heat processing of Korean ginseng can reduce carbohydrate absorption by inhibiting intestinal carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzymes in both in vitro and in vivo animal models. This reduced absorption of carbohydrate might be helpful to control body weight gain due to excessive carbohydrate consumption and support induced calorie restriction. However, the weight management effect, except for the effect due to anti-hyperglycemic action, along with the potential mechanism of action have not yet been determined. Therefore, the efforts of this study are to investigate and understand the possible weight management effect and mechanism action of AF-enriched barley extracts (BEE). More specifically, the effect of BEE on lipid accumulation and adipogenic gene expression, body weight gain, body weight, plasma lipids, body fat mass, and lipid deposition were evaluated using C57BL/6 mice and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes models. The formation of lipid droplets in the 3T3-L1 treated with BEE (500 and 750 &#xb5;g/mL) was significantly blocked (p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.01, respectively). Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet (30% fat) for 8 weeks with BEE (0.3 g/kg-body weight). Compared to the high fat diet control (HFD) group, the cells treated with BEE significantly decreased in intracellular lipid accumulation with concomitant decreases in the expression of key transcription factors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR&#x3b3;), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBP/&#x3b1;), the mRNA expression of downstream lipogenic target genes such as fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c). Supplementation of BEE effectively lowered the body weight gain, visceral fat accumulation, and plasma lipid concentrations. Compared to the HFD group, BEE significantly suppressed body weight gain (16.06 &#xb1; 2.44 g vs. 9.40 &#xb1; 1.39 g, p &lt; 0.01) and increased serum adiponectin levels, significantly, 1.6-folder higher than the control group. These results indicate that AF-enriched barley extracts may prevent diet-induced weight gain and the anti-obesity effect is mediated in part by inhibiting adipogenesis and increasing adiponectin level.",

    "abstract": "MiR-1908 is a miRNA located in the intron of the fatty acid desaturase 1 (FADS1) gene. The expression level of miR-1908 is abnormal in many diseases such as cancer. miR-1908 can inhibit the expression of at least 27 target genes by binding to the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of target genes. miR-1908 is involved in the biological processes of cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell apoptosis, cancer cell invasion, and metastasis. The expression of miR-1908 is regulated by 11 factors, including lncRNA HOTTIP, adipokines (TNF-&#x3b1;, leptin, and resistin), NF-&#x3ba;B, free fatty acid (FFA), cholesterol, stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1), immune-related transcription factors (STAT1, RB1, and IRF1). The expression of miR-1908 is also affected by the anticancer drug OSW-1, growth hormone (GH), and the anticonvulsant drug sodium valproate. In addition, the aberrant expression of miR-1908 is also related to the prognosis of a variety of cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ovarian cancer (OC), breast cancer, cervical cancer, glioma, high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), osteosarcoma, etc. This article summarizes the abnormal expression pattern of miR-1908 in various diseases and its molecular regulation mechanisms.

However, the related pharmacological effects, especially for monoterpenoids or iridoid glycosides, which have obvious effects on improvement of NAFLD, have not been systematically analyzed. The objective of this review is to systematically examine the molecular mechanisms of monoterpenoids in NAFLD. The signaling pathways of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, insulin, nuclear factor &#x3ba;B, toll-like receptor, adipocytokine, RAC-&#x3b1; serine/threonine protein kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin, 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase, and autophagy have been proven to mediate this protective effect. We further compared the experimental data from animal models, including the dosage of these monoterpenoids in detail, and demonstrated that they are effective and safe candidate drugs for NAFLD. This review provides a reference for the development of NAFLD drugs as well as a research guideline for the potential uses of plant monoterpenoids.",

Ethnopharmacological use of Ononis spinosa L. roots (OSR) for treatment of obesity and metabolic disorders requires &#x430; scientific rationale. The current study examined the anti-adipogenic capacity of OSR and its secondary metabolites ononin (ONON) and maackiain (MACK) in human adipocytes as an in vitro model of obesity. Both ONON and MACK diminished lipid accumulation during adipocyte differentiation. Molecular docking analysis exposed the potential interactions between MACK or ONON and target regulatory adipogenic proteins. Furthermore, results from an RT-qPCR analysis disclosed significant upregulation of AMPK by MACK and ONON treatment. In addition, ONON increased SIRT1, PI3K and ACC mRNA expression, while MACK notably downregulated CEBPA, AKT, SREBP1, ACC and ADIPOQ. The protein level of PI3K, C/EBP&#x3b1;, PPAR&#x3b3; and adiponectin was reduced upon MACK treatment in a concentration-dependent manner. Similarly, ONON suppressed PI3K, PPAR&#x3b3; and adiponectin protein abundance. Finally, our study provides evidence that ONON exerts anti-adipogenic effect by upregulation of SIRT1 and inhibition of PI3K, PPAR&#x3b3; and adiponectin, while MACK induced strong inhibitory effect on adipogenesis via hampering PI3K, PPAR&#x3b3;/C/EBP&#x3b1; signaling and anti-lipogenic effect through downregulation of SREBP1 and ACC. Even though OSR does not hamper adipogenic differentiation, it could be exploited as a source of natural leads with anti-adipogenic potential. The multidirectional mechanism of action of MACK warrant further validation in the context of in vivo obesity models.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of lipids and their metabolites induces lipotoxicity in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Lowering ceramide concentration could reduce the impact of metabolic damage to target organs. Adiponectin improves lipotoxicity through its receptors (AdiopRs), which have sequence homology with ceramidase enzymes. Therefore, cardioprotective role of AdipoR agonism by AdipoRon was investigated. Sixteen-week-old male db/m and db/db mice were fed a diet containing AdipoRon for four weeks. Phenotypic and metabolic profiles with associated cellular signaling pathways involved in lipid metabolism were investigated in the mice heart and human cardiomyocytes to establish treatment effect of AdipoRon. AdipoRon ameliorated insulin resistance, fibrosis, M1-dominant inflammation, and apoptosis in association with reduced accumulations of free fatty acid, triglycerides, and TLR4-related ceramide in the heart. This resulted in overall reduction in the level of oxidative stress which ameliorated cardiac hypertrophy and its function. AdipoRon increased the expression of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 via pAMPK/FoxO1-induced Akt phosphorylation resulting from a decrease in PP2A level. It also increased acid ceramidase activity which reduced ceramide and increased sphingosine-1 phosphate levels in the heart of db/db mice and cultured human cardiomyocytes. Consistent upregulation of AdipoRs and their downstream regulatory pathways involving pAMPK/PPAR&#x3b1;/PGC-1&#x3b1; levels led to lipid metabolism enhancement, thereby improving lipotoxicity-induced peroxisome biogenesis and oxidative stress. AdipoRon might control oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in the heart through increased AdipoR expression, acid ceramidase activity, and activation of AMPK-PPAR&#x3b1;/PGC-1&#x3b1; and related downstream pathways, collectively improving cardiac lipid metabolism, hypertrophy, and functional parameters.",

    "title": "Apelin controls emotional behavior in age- and metabolic state-dependent manner.",
    "abstract": "Apelin is a small peptide secreted by the adipose tissue notably in conditions of obesity-induced hyper-insulinemia. Apelin exerts a range of physiological functions at the periphery including the improvement of insulin sensitivity and the increase of muscle strength or cardiac contractibility. Interestingly, the brain is endowed with a high density of APJ, the single target of apelin, and growing evidence suggests various central actions of this adipokine. Recent studies reported that the intracerebroventricular infusion of apelin modulates emotional states in middle age stressed animals. However, results are so far been mixed and have not allowed for definitive conclusions about the impact of apelin on anxio-depressive-like phenotype. This study aims 1) to evaluate whether serum apelin levels are associated with mood in older adults and 2) to determine the impact of the genetic apelin inactivation in 12-month old mice fed a standard diet (STD) or in 6-month old mice fed a high fat diet (HFD). A higher plasma apelin level was associated with higher depressive symptoms in older adults. In line with these clinical findings, 12-month old apelin knock-out (Ap<sup>-/-</sup>) mice displayed a spontaneous antidepressant-like phenotype. In a marked contrast, 6-month old Ap<sup>-/-</sup> mice harbored a higher degree of peripheral insulin resistance than wild-types in response to HFD and were more prone to develop anxiety while the depressive-like state was not modified. We also provided evidence that such anxious behavior was associated with an impairment of central serotonergic and dopaminergic neuronal activities. Finally, although the insulin sensitizing drug metformin failed to reverse HFD-induced insulin resistance in 6-month old Ap<sup>-/-</sup> mice, it reversed their anxious phenotype. These results emphasize a complex contribution of apelin in the regulation of emotional state that might depend on the age and the metabolic status of the animals. Further investigations are warranted to highlight the therapeutic potential of manipulating the apelinergic system in mood-related disorders.",

    "abstract": "Although pain has lower mortality rates than cancer, diabetes and stroke, pain is a predominate source of distress and disability. However, the management of pain remains an enormous problem. Many drugs used to pain treatment have more or less side effects. Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic target is critical for the treatment of pain. Notably, studies have shown that adipocytokines have a dual role in pain. Growing shreds of evidence shows that the levels of adipocytokines are upregulated or downregulated in the development of pain. In addition, substantial evidence indicates that regulation of adipocytokines levels in models of pain attenuates or promotes pain behaviors. In this review, we summarized and discussed the effect of adipocytokines in pain. These evidence indicates that adipocytokines attenuate or promote pain behaviors through interacting with their receptors, activating serotonin pathway, interacting with &#x3bc;-opioid receptor, activating microglia, infiltrating macrophage and so on. Overall, adipocytokines have some potential in treating pain, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear and need to be further studied.",

    "abstract": "Chemotherapeutic combinational approaches would be more efficient in decreasing toxicity of drug, preventing tumor progression in relation to either drug alone. Hence, the aim of this study is to constract magnetic PLGA/PEG nanoparticles (NPs) co-loaded with Metformin (Met) and Silibinin (Sil) to investigate their cytotoxicity as well as their impact on &#xa0;mRNA expression levels of leptin and leptin receptor genes in A549 lung cancer cells. The synthesized NPs were characterized by FTIR, FE-SEM, and VSM and then, MTT assay was utilized to assess and compare the cytotoxicity of various concentrations of the chemotheruptic molecules in pure and nanoformulated forms as well as in alone and combination state after 48 h exposure time. Moreover, the mRNA levels of leptin and its receptor genes expression were studied by quantitative real-time PCR. By co-encapsulation of Met and Sil into PLGA/PEG/ Fe3O4, cytotoxic efficiency of the compounds considerably augmented for all concentrations. Cytotoxicity assay displayed that combination of Met and Sil had a synergistic concentration-dependent effect on A549 lung cancer cells. Moreover, qPCR data revealed that the expression levels of the leptin and leptin receptor was considerably reduced with increasing concentrations of drug-encapsulated magnetic NPs, especially Met/Sil-encapsulated PLGA/PEG/ Fe3O4 NPs. Present preliminary study shows that co-incorporating Met, Sil, Fe3O4 into PLGA/PEG NPs might provide a more promising and safe treatment strategy for lung cancer.",

    "title": "TNF-<i>&#x3b1;</i> Antagonizes the Effect of Leptin on Insulin Secretion through FOXO1-Dependent Transcriptional Suppression of LepRb in INS-1 Cells.",
    "abstract": "Proinflammatory cytokines play a causal role in the development of hyperinsulinemia and T2MD. FOXO1, a transcription factor which is known to enhance proinflammation, was recently shown to be involved in obesity-induced &#x3b2; cell dysfunction. However, molecular mechanisms for the association remained elusive. In this study, we first found that both leptin (10&#x2009;nM) and TNF-&#x3b1; (20&#x2009;ng/ml) significantly inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) of INS-1E cells. When in combination, the GSIS function of INS-1E cells was significantly increased compared with that of the leptin alone treatment, indicating that TNF-&#x3b1; attenuated the inhibiting effect of leptin on GSIS of INS-1E cells. Similarly, we found that TNF-&#x3b1; has the same inhibitory effect on leptin in regulating insulin synthesis and secretion, and the survival and apoptosis of insulin cells. Further studies showed that TNF-&#x3b1; blocks leptin pathway by reducing the expression of leptin receptor (LepRb, also called OBRb) and inhibiting the activation of STAT3, a key molecule involved in the leptin signaling pathway in INS-1E cells. Besides, the downregulated expression of phosphorylated FOXO1 was found to be involved in the possible mechanism of TNF-&#x3b1;. Overexpression of constitutively active FOXO1 markedly aggravated the LepRb reduction by TNF-&#x3b1; treatment of INS-1E cells, and the endogenous FOXO1 knockdown abolished the effect of TNF-&#x3b1; on INS-1E cells. Furthermore, we have proved that FOXO1 could directly bind to the promoter of LepRb as a negative transcription regulator. Taken together, the results of this study reveal that TNF-&#x3b1;-induced LepRb downregulated in pancreatic &#x3b2; cells and demonstrate that transcriptional reduction of FOXO1 might be the primary mechanism underlying TNF-&#x3b1; promoting INS-1E leptin resistance and &#x3b2; cell dysfunction. Conclusions. Our current studies based on INS-1E cells in vitro indicate that the inflammatory factor TNF-&#x3b1; plays an important role in the development of INS-1E leptin resistance and glucose metabolism disorders, probably through FOXO1-induced transcription reduction of LepRb promoter in pancreatic &#x3b2; cells, and FOXO1 may be a novel target for treating &#x3b2; cell dysfunction in obesity-induced hyperinsulinemia and T2DM.",

    "title": "17&#x3b2;-estradiol rescues the damage of thiazolidinedione on chicken Sertoli cell proliferation via adiponectin.",
    "abstract": "Thiazolidinedione (TZD) is an oral anti-diabetic drug that exhibits some side effects on the male reproductive system by interfering with the steroidogenesis and androgenic activity and also shows anti-proliferative effect on several cell types. This study investigated the effect of TZD on immature chicken Sertoli cell (SC) proliferation and the potential mechanism by which 17&#x3b2;-estradiol regulated this process. Chicken SC viability was investigated under different treatment concentration and time of TZD. 17&#x3b2;-estradiol (0.001&#xa0;&#x3bc;M, 24&#xa0;h) was added to analyze its effects on TZD-mediated cell viability, cell metabolic activity, cell growth, cell cycle progression, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, antioxidant enzyme activity, mitochondria activity, oxygen consumption rate, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level, and mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activity, adiponectin expression and several cell proliferation-related genes mRNA and protein levels. We performed the microRNA (miRNA) array to find TZD-induced differentially expressed miRNAs and validated whether miR-1577 can target on adiponectin via the dual luciferase reporter assay, as well as verified the effect of adiponectin addition with different concentrations on the SC viability. Further, SCs were transfected with miR-1577 agomir (a double-stranded synthetic miRNA mimic) in the presence or absence of TZD and antagomir (a single-stranded synthetic miRNA inhibitor) in the presence or absence of 17&#x3b2;-estradiol to analyze whether miR-1577 was involved in TZD-mediated SC proliferation and whether 17&#x3b2;-estradiol regulated this process. Results showed that TZD significantly inhibited SC viability, cell metabolic activity, cell growth, and cell cycle progression, while increased adiponectin level and ROS generation. TZD-treated SCs presented decreases of antioxidant enzyme activity, mitochondria activity, basal and maximal respiration, ATP production and level, mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activity, and mRNA and protein expressions of several cell proliferation-related genes, as well as the significant alteration of miRNA expressions (a total number of 55 miRNAs were up-regulated whereas 53 miRNAs down-regulated). Whereas, 17&#x3b2;-estradiol played a positive role in chicken SC proliferation and rescued the damage of TZD on SC proliferation by up-regulating miR-1577 expression whose target gene was validated to be the adiponectin. In addition, exogenous adiponectin (more than 1&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/ml) treatment exhibited a significant inhibition on the SC viability. Transfection of miR-1577 agomir promoted the SC proliferation via down-expressed adiponectin, and increased the mitochondrial function and cell proliferation-related gene expression, while TZD weakened the positive effect of miR-1577 agomir on SCs. On the other hand, transfection of miR-1577 antagomir inhibited SC proliferation by producing the opposite effects on above parameters, while 17&#x3b2;-estradiol attenuated the negative effect of miR-1577 antagomir on SCs. These findings suggest down-expressed miR-1577 is involved in the regulation of TZD-inhibited SC proliferation through increasing adiponectin level, and this damage of TZD on the immature chicken SC proliferation can be ameliorated by appropriate dose of exogenous 17&#x3b2;-estradiol treatment. This study provides an insight into the cytoprotective effect of 17&#x3b2;-estradiol on TZD-damaged SC proliferation and may suggest a potential strategy for reducing the risk of SC dysfunction caused by the abuse of TZD.",

Omentin-1 has been found to exert important anti-inflammatory, antioxidative and anti-apoptotic roles and to regulate endothelial dysfunction. Moreover, omentin-1 also has protective effects against cancer, atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and bone metabolic diseases. The current review will discuss the therapeutic potential of omentin-1. This review summarizes the biological actions of omentin-1 and provides an overview of omentin-1 in metabolic-related diseases. The relevant literature was derived from a PubMed search spanning 1998-2021 using these search terms: omentin-1, atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, bone, cancer, inflammation, and oxidative stress. As a novel adipocytokine, omentin-1 is a promising therapeutic target in metabolic-related diseases. Preclinical animal studies have shown encouraging results. Moreover, circulating omentin-1 has excellent potential as a noninvasive biomarker. In the future, strategies for regulating omentin-1 need to be investigated further in clinical trials in a large cohort.",

Therefore, PPP1CB is considered as a potential therapeutic target for obesity. We screened 1033 natural products for PPP1CB inhibitors and identified chebulinic acid, which is abundantly present in the seeds of Euphoria longana and fruits of Terminalia chebula. Chebulinic acid strongly inhibited the hydrolysis of 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate by PPP1CB (IC50 = 300 nM) and demonstrated potent antiadipogenic effects in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes in a concentration-dependent manner. Additional studies have demonstrated that chebulinic acid suppresses early differentiation by downregulating key transcription factors that control adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells. These results suggested that chebulinic acid may be a potential therapeutic agent for treating obesity by inhibiting PPP1CB activity.",

    "abstract": "The adipose tissue-derived hormone leptin can drive decreases in food intake while increasing energy expenditure. In diet-induced obesity, circulating leptin levels rise proportionally to adiposity. Despite this hyperleptinemia, rodents and humans with obesity maintain increased adiposity and are resistant to leptin's actions. Here we show that inhibitors of the cytosolic enzyme histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) act as potent leptin sensitizers and anti-obesity agents in diet-induced obese mice. Specifically, HDAC6 inhibitors, such as tubastatin A, reduce food intake, fat mass, hepatic steatosis and improve systemic glucose homeostasis in an HDAC6-dependent manner. Mechanistically, peripheral, but not central, inhibition of HDAC6 confers central leptin sensitivity. Additionally, the anti-obesity effect of tubastatin A is attenuated in animals with a defective central leptin-melanocortin circuitry, including db/db and MC4R knockout mice. Our results suggest the existence of an HDAC6-regulated adipokine that serves as a leptin-sensitizing agent and reveals HDAC6 as a potential target for the treatment of obesity.",

    "title": "Fibroblast growth factor-21 improves insulin action in nonlactating ewes.",
    "abstract": "During metabolically demanding physiological states, ruminants and other mammals coordinate nutrient use among tissues by varying the set point of insulin action. This set point is regulated in part by metabolic hormones with some antagonizing (e.g., growth hormone and TNF&#x3b1;) and others potentiating (e.g., adiponectin) insulin action. Fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) was recently identified as a sensitizing hormone in rodent and primate models of defective insulin action. FGF21 administration, however, failed to improve insulin action in dairy cows during the naturally occurring insulin resistance of lactation, raising the possibility that ruminants as a class of animals or lactation as a physiological state are unresponsive to FGF21. To start addressing this question, we asked whether FGF21 could improve insulin action in nonlactating ewes. Gene expression studies showed that the ovine FGF21 system resembles that of other species, with liver as the major site of FGF21 expression and adipose tissue as a target tissue based on high expression of the FGF21 receptor complex and activation of p44/42 extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) following exogenous FGF21 administration. FGF21 treatment for 13 days reduced plasma glucose and insulin over the entire treatment period and improved glucose disposal during a glucose tolerance test. FGF21 increased plasma adiponectin by day 3 of treatment but had no effect on the plasma concentrations of total, C16:0-, or C18:0-ceramide. Overall, these data confirm that the insulin-sensitizing effects of FGF21 are conserved in ruminants and raise the possibility that lactation is an FGF21-resistant state.",

However, the mechanism of its therapeutic effect on NAFLD remains unclear. The poor understanding may be due to problems with mouse, a species most used for animal experiments. TZDs exacerbate fatty liver in mouse models while they improve it in rat models like in human patients. Therefore, we compared the effects of TZDs including PGZ and rosiglitazone (RGZ) in ob/ob mice and Lep<sup>mkyo</sup>/Lep<sup>mkyo</sup> rats, models of leptin-deficient obesity, and A-ZIP/F-1 mice and seipin knockout (SKO) rats, models of generalized lipodystrophy. Pparg mRNA expression was markedly upregulated in fatty livers of mouse models while it was unchanged in rat models. TZDs exacerbated fatty liver in ob/ob and A-ZIP/F-1 mice, improved it in Lep<sup>mkyo</sup>/Lep<sup>mkyo</sup> rats and showed no effect in SKO rats. Gene expression analyses of Pparg and its target gene, Fsp27 revealed that PPAR&#x3b3; in the adipose tissue is the exclusive therapeutic target of TZDs in rats but PPAR&#x3b3; in the liver in addition to the adipose tissue is also a major site of actions for TZDs in mice. Although the response to TZDs in mice is the complete opposite of that in human patients, no report has pointed out the problem with TZD studies using mouse models so far. The present study might provide useful suggestions in research on TZDs.",

    "abstract": "Beginning at 16 weeks of age and continuing for 44 weeks, male C57BL/6J were fed either a control (CON) diet; a high-fat (HF) diet (60% unsaturated); or the HF diet containing an extract of unripe avocados (AvX) enriched in the 7-carbon sugar mannoheptulose (MH), designed to act as a glycolytic inhibitor (HF + MH). Compared to the CON diet, mice on the HF diet exhibited higher body weights; body fat; blood lipids; and leptin with reduced adiponectin levels, insulin sensitivity, VO2max, and falls from a rotarod. Mice on the HF + MH diet were completely protected against these changes in the absence of significant diet effects on food intake. Compared to the CON diet, oxidative stress was also increased by the HF diet indicated by higher levels of total reactive oxygen species, superoxide, and peroxynitrite measured in liver samples by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, whereas the HF + MH diet attenuated these changes. Compared to the CON, the HF diet increased signaling in the mechanistic target of the rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, and the addition of the MH-enriched AvX to this diet attenuated these changes. Beyond generating further interest in the health benefits of avocados, these results draw further new attention to the effects of this rare sugar, MH, as a botanical intervention for preventing obesity.",

    "abstract": "Multiple studies have confirmed that adipokines are compactly relevant to insulin resistance and participate in the pathogenesis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This paper aimed to study the effects of C1q/tumor necrosis factor related protein (CTRP)6 on the phenotypes of trophoblast cells, covering cell proliferation, invasion and migration, and initially explore the mechanism. High glucose was used to induce trophoblast cells to establish an in vitro model. The expression levels of CTRP6 were firstly determined, and then the effects of CTRP6 knockdown on cell viability, apoptosis, migration and invasion were assessed using CCK8, TUNEL, wound healing, Transwell assays. Moreover, the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR&#x3b3;), probable target of CTRP6, was evaluated through co-transfection with PPAR&#x3b3; overexpression vector. The results of the present study revealed that CTRP6 and PPAR&#x3b3; were both upregulated in high glucose-induced cells. And CTRP6 knockdown could significantly elevate the abilities of cell viability, migration and invasion, and avoid cell apoptosis. In addition, PPAR&#x3b3; overexpression was found to restrain the protective effects of CTRP6 knockdown on the above aspects, indicating CTRP6 played a role in trophoblast cells via inhibiting PPAR&#x3b3; expression. In conclusion, CTRP6 regulated the viability, migration and invasion of high glucose-induced gestational trophoblast cells through PPAR&#x3b3; signaling.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin, an adipocyte-secreted protein-hormone with inflammatory properties, has a potentially important role in the development and progression of asthma. Unravelling whether adiponectin is a causal risk factor for asthma is an important issue to clarify as adiponectin could be a potential novel drug target for the treatment of asthma. We tested the hypothesis that plasma adiponectin is associated observationally and causally (using genetic variants as instrumental variables) with risk of asthma. In the Copenhagen General Population Study, we did an observational analysis in 28 845 individuals (2278 asthma cases) with plasma adiponectin measurements, and a genetic one-sample Mendelian randomisation analysis in 94 868 individuals (7128 asthma cases) with 4 genetic variants. Furthermore, in the UK Biobank, we did a genetic two-sample Mendelian randomisation analysis in 462 933 individuals (53 598 asthma cases) with 12 genetic variants. Lastly, we meta-analysed the genetic findings. While a 1 unit log-transformed higher plasma adiponectin in the Copenhagen General Population Study was associated with an observational OR of 1.65 (95% CI 1.29 to 2.08) for asthma, the corresponding genetic causal OR was 1.03 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.42). The genetic causal OR for asthma in the UK Biobank was 1.00 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.00). Lastly, genetic meta-analysis confirmed lack of association between genetically high plasma adiponectin and causal OR for asthma. Observationally, high plasma adiponectin is associated with increased risk of asthma; however, genetic evidence could not support a causal association between plasma adiponectin and asthma.",

    "abstract": "The upregulation of adiponectin production has been suggested as a novel strategy for the treatment of metabolic diseases. Galangin, a natural flavonoid, exhibited adiponectin synthesis-promoting activity during adipogenesis in human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. In target identification, galangin bound both peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) &#x3b3; and estrogen receptor (ER) &#x3b2;. Novel galangin derivatives were synthesized to improve adiponectin synthesis-promoting compounds by increasing the PPAR&#x3b3; activity of galangin and reducing its ER&#x3b2; activity, because PPAR&#x3b3; functions can be inhibited by ER&#x3b2;. Three galangin 3-benzyl-5-methylether derivatives significantly promoted adiponectin production by 2.88-, 4.47-, and 2.76-fold, respectively, compared to the effect of galangin. The most potent compound, galangin 3-benzyl-5,7-dimethylether, selectively bound to PPAR&#x3b3; (Ki, 1.7&#xa0;&#x3bc;M), whereas it did not bind to ER&#x3b2;. Galangin 3-benzyl-5,7-dimethylether was identified as a PPAR&#x3b3; partial agonist in docking and pharmacological competition studies, suggesting that it may have diverse therapeutic potential in a variety of metabolic diseases.",

C1q tumor necrosis factor-related protein 1 (CTRP1) is a 35-kDa glycoprotein synthesized by various tissues and cells, such as adipose tissue and macrophages. As an adiponectin paralog, CTRP1 signals through adiponectin receptor 1 and participates in a variety of pathophysiological processes. Circulating CTRP1 levels are significantly increased in patients with coronary artery disease. Importantly, CTRP1 was shown to accelerate the development of atherosclerosis by promoting vascular inflammation, macrophage foam cell formation, and endothelial barrier dysfunction. This review focused on recent advances regarding the role of CTRP1 in atherogenesis with an emphasis on its potential as a novel biomarker and a promising therapeutic target for atherosclerosis-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Leptin modulates insulin signaling and this involves the Akt pathway, which is influenced by changes in the inflammatory environment and with leptin regulating cytokine synthesis. We evaluated the association between activation of the insulin-signaling pathway and alterations in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels in inguinal fat and liver of chronic central leptin infused (L), pair-fed (PF), and control rats. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation was increased in inguinal fat and reduced in liver of L rats. Phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB) was increased in inguinal fat of L rats, together with a pro-inflammatory cytokine profile, while in the liver activation of JNK and NFkB were reduced and an anti-inflammatory pattern was found. Phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, Akt and mechanistic target of rapamycin was decreased in inguinal fat and increased in liver of L rats. There was a direct relationship between pSTAT3 and JNK and a negative correlation of Akt with pSTAT3 and JNK in both tissues. These results indicate that the effects of chronically increased leptin on insulin-related signaling are tissue-specific and suggest that inflammation plays a relevant role in the crosstalk between leptin and insulin signaling.",

    "abstract": "Obesity triggers the development of adipokines such as leptin, resistin, and visfatin, which have been associated with the development of diabetic nephropathy and other vascular disorders. The main purpose of the current investigation was to identify the physiological impact of visfatin on immunological response and its inflammatory effects on nephropathy. Fifty Iraqi patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) at various stages, as described by the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) and ranging in age from 48.367.56 to 53.68 8.46 years on average were considered. Prior to the start of the investigation, informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the ethics committee approved the study. Patients were classified into two groups: Group (A) comprised patients with a GFR higher than 60 mL/minute, and Group (B) comprised patients with a GFR of less than 60 mL/min. There was no considerable variance between the groups as regards visfatin, but a highly significant correlation between serum visfatin and CRP was observed. The results of the current investigation indicated that serum visfatin levels are significantly correlated with CRP in CKD patients; it is also correlated with deterioration of kidney function. Moreover, higher visfatin levels were accompanied by increased serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels. These findings would suggest that visfatin may perform an essential function in uremia-related inflammation and may serve as a potential target for treatment and prevention of renal associated complications. Future studies may delineate whether visfatin is a marker of disease activity and severity as well as a predictor of outcome in CKD.",

    "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered one of the most serious public health problems affecting liver. The reported beneficial impact of raspberries on obesity and associated metabolic disorder makes it a suitable candidate against NAFLD. In the current study, the chemical profile of raspberry seed oil (RO) was characterized by analysis of fatty acid and tocopherol contents using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in addition to the determination of total phenolic and flavonoids. High levels of unsaturated fatty acids, linoleic acid (49.9%), &#x3b1;-linolenic acid (25.98%), and oleic acid (17.6%), along with high total tocopherol content (184&#xa0;mg/100&#xa0;gm) were detected in oil. The total phenolic and flavonoid contents in RO were estimated to be 22.40&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.25&#xa0;mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/100&#xa0;mg oil and 1.34&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.15&#xa0;mg&#xa0;quercetin (QU)/100&#xa0;mg, respectively. Anti-NAFLD efficacy of RO at different doses (0.4 and 0.8&#xa0;mL) in a model of a high-fat diet (HFD) fed rats was assessed by estimating lipid profile, liver enzyme activity, glucose and insulin levels as well as adipokines and inflammatory marker. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x3b3; (PPAR&#x3b3;), which is a molecular target for NAFLD was also tested. Liver histopathology was carried out and its homogenate was used to estimate oxidative stress markers. Consumption of RO significantly improved lipid parameters and hepatic enzyme activities, reduced insulin resistance and glucose levels, significantly ameliorated inflammatory and oxidative stress markers. Furthermore, RO treatment significantly modulated adipokines activities and elevated PPAR&#x3b3; levels. Raspberry seed oil administration significantly improved these HFD induced histopathological alterations. Moreover, a molecular docking study was performed on the identified fatty acids and tocopherols. Among the identified compounds, oleic acid, &#x3b1;-linolenic acid and &#x3b3;-tocopherol exhibited the highest docking score as PPAR&#x3b3; activator posing them as a potential anti-NAFLD drug leads.

However, existing therapies for GDM remain scant, with the most common being lifestyle intervention and appropriate insulin treatment. MOTS-c, a mitochondrial-derived peptide, can target skeletal muscle and enhance glucose metabolism. Here, we demonstrate that MOTS-c can be an effective treatment for GDM. A GDM mouse model was established by short term high-fat diet combined with low-dose streptozotocin (STZ) treatment while MOTS-c was administrated daily during pregnancy. GDM symptoms such as blood glucose and insulin levels, glucose and insulin tolerance, as well as reproductive outcomes were investigated. MOTS-c significantly alleviated hyperglycemia, improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, and reduced birth weight and the death of offspring induced by GDM. Similar to a previous study, MOTS-c also could activate insulin sensitivity in the skeletal muscle of GDM mice and elevate glucose uptake in vitro. In addition, we found that MOTS-c protects pancreatic &#x3b2;-cell from STZ-mediated injury. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that MOTS-c could be a promising strategy for the treatment of GDM.",

    "title": "Secreted indicators of androgen receptor activity in breast cancer pre-clinical models.",
    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence has attracted attention to the androgen receptor (AR) as a biomarker and therapeutic target in breast cancer. We hypothesized that AR activity within the tumor has clinical implications and investigated whether androgen responsive serum factors might serve as a minimally invasive indicator of tumor AR activity. Based on a comprehensive gene expression analysis of an AR-positive, triple negative breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model, 163 dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-responsive genes were defined as an androgen responsive gene set. Among them, we focused on genes that were DHT-responsive that encode secreted proteins, namely KLK3, AZGP1 and PIP, that encode the secreted factors prostate specific antigen (PSA), zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein (ZAG) and prolactin induced protein (PIP), respectively. Using AR-positive breast cancer cell lines representing all breast cancer subtypes, expression of candidate factors was assessed in response to agonist DHT and antagonist enzalutamide. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed on publically available gene expression datasets from breast cancer patients to analyze the relationship between genes encoding the secreted factors and other androgen responsive gene sets in each breast cancer subtype. Anti-androgen treatment decreased proliferation in all cell lines tested representing various tumor subtypes. Expression of the secreted factors was regulated by AR activation in the majority of breast cancer cell lines. In GSEA, the candidate genes were positively correlated with an androgen responsive gene set across breast cancer subtypes. KLK3, AZGP1 and PIP are AR regulated and reflect tumor AR activity. Further investigations are needed to examine the potential efficacy of these factors as serum biomarkers.",

    "title": "The adiponectin signalling pathway - A therapeutic target for the cardiac complications of type 2 diabetes?",
    "abstract": "Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of heart failure (HF). This is commonly termed diabetic cardiomyopathy and is often characterised by increased cardiac fibrosis, pathological hypertrophy, increased oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress as well as diastolic dysfunction. Adiponectin is a cardioprotective adipokine that is downregulated in settings of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. Furthermore, both adiponectin receptors (AdipoR1 and R2) are also downregulated in these settings which further results in impaired cardiac adiponectin signalling and reduced cardioprotection. In many cardiac pathologies, adiponectin signalling has been shown to protect against cardiac remodelling and lipotoxicity, however its cardioprotective actions in T2D-induced cardiomyopathy remain unresolved. Diabetic cardiomyopathy has historically lacked effective treatment options. In this review, we summarise the current evidence for links between the suppressed adiponectin signalling pathway and cardiac dysfunction, in diabetes. We describe adiponectin receptor-mediated signalling pathways that are normally associated with cardioprotection, as well as current and potential future therapeutic approaches that could target this pathway as possible interventions for diabetic cardiomyopathy.",

    "abstract": "Heap-up of &#x3b1;-synuclein (&#x3b1;-Syn) and its association with tau protein are esteemed to trigger the onset of Parkinson's disease (PD). The purpose of this study was to develop multi-functional liposomes incorporated with 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC), cholesterol, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and phosphatidylserine (PS) to load astragaloside IV (AS-IV) and nestifin-1 (NF-1), followed by grafting with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and leptin (Lep) (WGA-Lep-AS-IV-NF-1-PS-liposomes) to protect dopaminergic neurons from apoptosis. Experimental results showed that increasing the mole percentage of DSPC and PS enhanced the particle size, particle stability and entrapment efficiency of AS-IV and NF-1, and reduced the drug releasing rate. Strong affinity of NF-1 to PS was evidenced by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. WGA-Lep-AS-IV-NF-1-PS-liposomes diminished transendothelial electrical resistance and improved the capacity of propidium iodide, AS-IV and NF-1 to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Immunocytochemical staining exhibited the ability of functionalized liposomes to target Lep receptor and &#x3b1;-Syn in MPP<sup>+</sup>-insulted SH-SY5Y cells. Western blots revealed a substantial reduction of &#x3b1;-Syn and phosphorylated tau protein in the anti-oxidative pathway through interaction with PS. During the course of treatment with WGA-Lep-AS-IV-NF-1-PS-liposomes, the combined activity of AS-IV and NF-1 and recognition capability simultaneously decreased the expression of Bax, and increased the expressions of Bcl-2, tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter. The liposomes carrying AS-IV and NF-1 can rescue degenerated neurons and are a promising formulation to achieve better PD management.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a severe public health issue worldwide. It displays a harmful effect on different organs as the eyes, kidneys and neural cells due to insulin resistance and high blood glucose concentrations. To date, the available treatments for this disorder remain limited. Several reports have correlated obesity with type 2 diabetes. Mainly, dysfunctional adipocytes and the regulation of high secretion of inflammatory cytokines are the crucial links between obesity and insulin resistance. Several clinical and epidemiological studies have also correlated the onset of type 2 diabetes with inflammation, which is now indicated as a new target for type 2 diabetes treatment. Thus, it appears essential to discover new drugs able to inhibit the secretion of proinflammatory adipocytokines in type 2 diabetes. Adipocytes produce inflammatory cytokines in response to inflammation or high glucose levels. Once activated by a specific ligand, CXCR1 and CXCR2 mediate some cytokines' effects by activating an intracellular signal cascade once activated by a specific ligand. Therefore, it is conceivable to hypothesize that a specific antagonist of these receptors may ameliorate type 2 diabetes and glucose metabolism. Herein, differentiated 3T3-L1-adipocytes were subjected to high glucose or inflammatory conditions or the combination of both and then treated with ladarixin, a CXCR1/2 inhibitor. The results obtained point towards the positive regulation by ladarixin on insulin sensitivity, glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT4, cytokine proteome profile and lipid metabolism, thus suggesting ladarixin as a potentially helpful treatment in type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity.",

    "title": "Insulin resistance and insulin sensitizing agents.",
    "abstract": "Insulin resistance is a common feature of obesity and type 2 diabetes, but novel approaches of diabetes subtyping (clustering) revealed variable degrees of insulin resistance in people with diabetes. Specifically, the severe insulin resistant diabetes (SIRD) subtype not only exhibits metabolic abnormalities, but also bears a higher risk for cardiovascular, renal and hepatic comorbidities. In humans, insulin resistance comprises dysfunctional adipose tissue, lipotoxic insulin signaling followed by glucotoxicity, oxidative stress and low-grade inflammation. Recent studies show that aside from metabolites (free fatty acids, amino acids) and signaling proteins (myokines, adipokines, hepatokines) also exosomes with their cargo (proteins, mRNA and microRNA) contribute to altered crosstalk between skeletal muscle, liver and adipose tissue during the development of insulin resistance. Reduction of fat mass mainly, but not exclusively, explains the success of lifestyle modification and bariatric surgery to improve insulin sensitivity. Moreover, some older antihyperglycemic drugs (metformin, thiazolidinediones), but also novel therapeutic concepts (new peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists, incretin mimetics, sodium glucose cotransporter inhibitors, modulators of energy metabolism) can directly or indirectly reduce insulin resistance. This review summarizes molecular mechanisms underlying insulin resistance including the roles of exosomes and microRNAs, as well as strategies for the management of insulin resistance in humans.",

    "abstract": "ER stress and activation of the unfolded protein response in the periphery as well as the central nervous system have been linked to various metabolic abnormalities. Chemically lowering protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK) activity within the hypothalamus leads to decreased food intake and body weight. However, the cell populations required in this response remain undefined. In the current study, we investigated the effects of proopiomelanocortin-specific (POMC-specific) PERK deficiency on energy balance and glucose metabolism. Male mice deficient for PERK in POMC neurons exhibited improvements in energy balance on a high-fat diet, showing decreased food intake and body weight, independent of changes in glucose and insulin tolerances. The plant-based inhibitor of PERK, celastrol, increases leptin sensitivity, resulting in decreased food intake and body weight in a murine model of diet-induced obesity (DIO). Our data extend these observations by demonstrating that celastrol-induced improvements in leptin sensitivity and energy balance were attenuated in mice with PERK deficiency in POMC neurons. Altogether, these data suggest that POMC-specific PERK deficiency in male mice confers protection against DIO, possibly providing a new therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetes and metabolic syndrome.",

    "title": "The physiologic and physiopathologic roles of perivascular adipose tissue and its interactions with blood vessels and the renin-angiotensin system.",
    "abstract": "The perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) refers to an ectopic local deposit of connective tissue that anatomically surrounds most of the blood vessels. While it was initially known only as a structural support for vasculature, the landmark findings of Soltis and Cassis (1991), first demonstrating that PVAT reduces the contractions of norepinephrine in the isolated rat aorta, brought the potential vascular role of PVAT into the limelight. This seminal work implied the potential ability of PVAT to influence vascular responsiveness. Several vasoactive/vasocrine substances influencing vascular homeostasis were successively shown to be released from PVAT that include both adipocyte-derived relaxing and contracting factors. The PVAT is currently recognized as a metabolically active endocrine organ and is eventually considered as the 'protagonist' in vascular homeostasis. It plays prominent defending and opposing roles in vascular function, while the actual vascular influences of PVAT vary with an increase in adiposity. Recent studies have presented compelling evidence implicating the pivotal role of PVAT in the local activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which substantially impacts vascular physiology and physiopathology. Current findings have advanced our understanding of the role of PVAT in favorably or adversely modulating the vascular function through differential RAS activation. Given that adipocytes also produce major RAS components locally to influence vascular function, this review provides a scientific basis to distinctly understand the key role of PVAT in regulating the autocrine and paracrine functions of vascular RAS components and its potential as an emerging therapeutic target for mitigating cardiovascular complications.",

    "title": "Leptin sensitizing effect of 1,3-butanediol and its potential mechanism.",
    "abstract": "Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone that regulates appetite and energy expenditure via the hypothalamus. Since the majority of obese subjects are leptin resistant, leptin sensitizers, rather than leptin itself, are expected to be anti-obesity drugs. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the hypothalamus plays a key role in the pathogenesis of leptin resistance. ATP-deficient cells are vulnerable to ER stress and ATP treatment protects cells against ER stress. Thus, we investigated the therapeutic effects of oral 1,3-butanediol (BD) administration, which increases plasma &#x3b2;-hydroxybutyrate and hypothalamic ATP concentrations, in diet induced obese (DIO) mice with leptin resistance. BD treatment effectively decreased food intake and body weight in DIO mice. In contrast, BD treatment had no effect in leptin deficient ob/ob mice. Co-administration experiment demonstrated that BD treatment sensitizes leptin action in both DIO and ob/ob mice. We also demonstrated that BD treatment attenuates ER stress and leptin resistance at the hypothalamus level. This is the first report to confirm the leptin sensitizing effect of BD treatment in leptin resistant DIO mice. The present study provides collateral evidence suggesting that the effect of BD treatment is mediated by the elevation of hypothalamic ATP concentration. Ketone bodies and hypothalamic ATP are the potential target for the treatment of obesity and its complications.",

    "abstract": "The trimethylation on histone H3 lysine 27 (H3k27me3), a transcriptionally repressive epigenetic mark of permissive chromatin, can be removed by the histone lysine demethylase 6a (Kdm6a). However, the physiological function of H3k27me3 and Kdm6a on circadian genes remains largely elusive. With the ChIP-Seq and mRNA microarray assays, a critical role is identified for Kdm6a in the regulation of H3k27me3 to impact the expression of Crytochrome 1 (Cry1) in the hypothalamus of diet induced obesity mice. More importantly, both conditional knockout and pharmacological inhibition of Kdm6a reduce body weight and stabilize blood glucose homeostasis. Although a Kdm6a inhibitor fails to decrease body weight in leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice, it significantly decreases Cry1 expression, enhances sensitivity to exogenous leptin administration, and blocks body weight increases in endo-leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. Moreover, gene analysis of the human hypothalamus further reveals a positive correlation between Kdm6a and Cry1. The results show that inhibition of Kdm6a reduces the Cry1 expression and sensitizes leptin signaling to combat obesity-related disease. Therefore, it implicates Kdm6a as an attractive drug target for obesity and metabolic disorders.",

    "title": "Contribution of Adipose Tissue to the Chronic Immune Activation and Inflammation Associated With HIV Infection and Its Treatment.",
    "abstract": "White adipose tissue (AT) contributes significantly to inflammation - especially in the context of obesity. Several of AT's intrinsic features favor its key role in local and systemic inflammation: (i) large distribution throughout the body, (ii) major endocrine activity, and (iii) presence of metabolic and immune cells in close proximity. In obesity, the concomitant pro-inflammatory signals produced by immune cells, adipocytes and adipose stem cells help to drive local inflammation in a vicious circle. Although the secretion of adipokines by AT is a prime contributor to systemic inflammation, the lipotoxicity associated with AT dysfunction might also be involved and could affect distant organs. In HIV-infected patients, the AT is targeted by both HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy (ART). During the primary phase of infection, the virus targets AT directly (by infecting AT CD4 T cells) and indirectly (via viral protein release, inflammatory signals, and gut disruption). The initiation of ART drastically changes the picture: ART reduces viral load, restores (at least partially) the CD4 T cell count, and dampens inflammatory processes on the whole-body level but also within the AT. However, ART induces AT dysfunction and metabolic side effects, which are highly dependent on the individual molecules and the combination used. First generation thymidine reverse transcriptase inhibitors predominantly target mitochondrial DNA and induce oxidative stress and adipocyte death. Protease inhibitors predominantly affect metabolic pathways (affecting adipogenesis and adipocyte homeostasis) resulting in insulin resistance. Recently marketed integrase strand transfer inhibitors induce both adipocyte adipogenesis, hypertrophy and fibrosis. It is challenging to distinguish between the respective effects of viral persistence, persistent immune defects and ART toxicity on the inflammatory profile present in ART-controlled HIV-infected patients. The host metabolic status, the size of the pre-established viral reservoir, the quality of the immune restoration, and the natural ageing with associated comorbidities may mitigate and/or reinforce the contribution of antiretrovirals (ARVs) toxicity to the development of low-grade inflammation in HIV-infected patients. Protecting AT functions appears highly relevant in ART-controlled HIV-infected patients. It requires lifestyle habits improvement in the absence of effective anti-inflammatory treatment. Besides, reducing ART toxicities remains a crucial therapeutic goal.",

    "abstract": "Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are proteolytic enzymes that have been associated with the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases and obesity. Adipose tissue in turn is an active endocrine organ capable of secreting a range of proinflammatory mediators with autocrine and paracrine properties, which contribute to the inflammation of adipose tissue and adjacent tissues. However, the potential inflammatory effects of MMPs in adipose tissue cells are still unknown. This study investigates the effects of BmooMP&#x3b1;-I, a single-domain snake venom metalloproteinase (SVMP), in activating an inflammatory response by 3T3-L1 preadipocytes in culture, focusing on prostaglandins (PGs), cytokines, and adipocytokines biosynthesis and mechanisms involved in prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release. The results show that BmooMP&#x3b1;-I induced the release of PGE2, prostaglandin I2 (PGI2), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and adiponectin by preadipocytes. BmooMP&#x3b1;-I-induced PGE2 biosynthesis was dependent on group-IIA-secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2-IIA), cytosolic phospholipase A2-&#x3b1; (cPLA2-&#x3b1;), and cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and -2 pathways. Moreover, BmooMP&#x3b1;-I upregulated COX-2 protein expression but not microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) expression. In addition, we demonstrate that the enzymatic activity of BmooMP&#x3b1;-I is essential for the activation of prostanoid synthesis pathways in preadipocytes. These data highlight preadipocytes as important targets for metalloproteinases and provide new insights into the contribution of these enzymes to the inflammation of adipose tissue and tissues adjacent to it.",

To examine the PI3K/Akt/mTOR/S6 kinase pathway involvement in leptin-induced VEGF A synthesis, the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) was incubated with human recombinant leptin and specific inhibitors of the proposed signaling molecules (rapamycin and wortmannin). We analyzed the role of specified signaling molecules in human recombinant leptin-induced physiological angiogenesis via VEGF A synthesis in detail with the support of various methodologies. Human recombinant leptin's ability to synthesize VEGF A is diminished significantly in the presence of inhibitors. This observation supported the role of PI3K/Akt/mTOR/S6 kinase signaling molecules in human recombinant leptin-mediated VEGF A synthesis while inducing angiogenesis in CAM. Synthesis of VEGF A, followed by the growth of new blood vessels, by human recombinant leptin via the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR/S6 kinase signaling pathway reflects mechanistic therapeutic application of human recombinant leptin. The data also signify the role of mTOR and S6 kinase molecules in angiogenesis under a physiological environment.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a risk factor for gallbladder cancer (GBC) development, and it correlates with shorter overall survival. Leptin, derived from adipocytes, has been suggested to contribute to the growth of cancer cells; however, the detailed mechanism of leptin in GBC drug resistance remains uninvestigated. In this study, our finding that patients with GBC with a higher BMI were associated with increased GBC risks, including shortened survival, is clinically relevant. Moreover, obese NOD/SCID mice exhibited a higher circulating concentration of leptin, which is associated with GBC growth and attenuated gemcitabine efficacy. We further revealed that leptin can inhibit gemcitabine-induced GBC cell death through myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) activation. The transcription factor C/EBP &#x3b4; (CEBPD) is responsive to activated STAT3 (pSTAT3) and contributes to MCL1 transcriptional activation upon leptin treatment. In addition, MCL1 mediates leptin-induced mitochondrial fusion and is associated with GBC cell survival. The findings in this study suggest the involvement of the pSTAT3/CEBPD/MCL1 axis in leptin-induced mitochondrial fusion and survival and provide a potentially new therapeutic target to improve the efficacy of gemcitabine in patients with GBC.",

    "abstract": "Since the role of estrogen in postmenauposal-associated dementia is still debatable, this issue urges the search for other medications. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is a drug used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and has shown a neuroprotective effect against other neurodegenerative diseases. Accordingly, the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of DMF on an experimental model of Alzheimer disease (AD) using D-galactose (D-Gal) administered to ovariectomized (OVX) rats, resembling a postmenopausal dementia paradigm. Adult 18-month old female Wistar rats were allocated into sham-operated and OVX/D-Gal groups that were either left untreated or treated with DMF for 56 days starting three weeks after sham-operation or ovariectomy. DMF succeeded to ameliorate cognitive (learning/short- and long-term memory) deficits and to enhance the dampened overall activity (NOR, Barnes-/Y-maze tests). These behavioral upturns were associated with increased intact neurons (Nissl stain) and a reduction in OVX/D-Gal-mediated hippocampal CA1 neurodegeneration and astrocyte activation assessed as GFAP immunoreactivity. Mechanistically, DMF suppressed the hippocampal contents of AD-surrogate markers; viz., apolipoprotein (APO)-E1, BACE1, A&#x3b2;42, and hyperphosphorylated Tau. Additionally, DMF has augmented the neuroprotective parameters p-AKT, its downstream target CREB and BDNF. Besides, it activated AMPK, and enhanced SIRT-1, as well as antioxidant defenses (SOD, GSH). On the other hand, DMF inhibited the transcription factor NF-&#x3ba;B, IL-1&#x3b2;, adiponectin/adiponectin receptor type (AdipoR)1, GSK-3&#x3b2;, and MDA. Accordingly, in this postmenopausal AD model, DMF treatment by pursuing the adiponectin/AdipoR1, AMPK/SIRT-1, AKT/CREB/BDNF, AKT/GSK-3&#x3b2;, and APO-E1 quartet hampered the associated tauo-/amyloidopathy and NF-&#x3ba;B-mediated oxidative/inflammatory responses to advance insights into its anti-amnesic effect.",

    "title": "Adiponectin: a potential target for obesity-associated Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "Obesity and dementia are two growing problems worldwide. Obesity act as a crucial risk factor for various diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Several preclinical studies showed that middle-age obesity can be act as a possible feature of mild cognitive impairment in later years. Some studies have also demonstrated that a high-fat diet causes AD pathology, including extracellular amyloid-beta accumulation, hyperphosphorylation of tau, and cognition impairment. The correlation and molecular mechanism related to obesity-associated AD needs to be better evaluated. Presently, obesity results in an altered expression of several hormones, growth factors, and adipokines. Multiple signaling pathways such as leptin, insulin, adiponectin, and glutamate are involved to regulate vital functions in the brain and act as neuroprotective mediators for AD in a normal state. In obesity, altered adiponectin (APN) level and its associated downstream pathway could result in multiple signaling pathway disruption. Presently, Adiponectin and its inducers or agonist are considered as potential therapeutics for obesity-associated AD. This review mainly focuses on the pleiotropic effects of adiponectin and its potential to treat obesity-associated AD.",

    "abstract": "The nutrient sensors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x3b3; (PPAR&#x3b3;) and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) closely interact in the regulation of adipocyte lipid storage. The precise mechanisms underlying this interaction and whether this extends to other metabolic processes and the endocrine function of adipocytes are still unknown. We investigated herein the involvement of mTORC1 as a mediator of the actions of the PPAR&#x3b3; ligand rosiglitazone in subcutaneous inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) mass, endocrine function, lipidome, transcriptome and branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism. Mice bearing regulatory associated protein of mTOR (Raptor) deletion and therefore mTORC1 deficiency exclusively in adipocytes and littermate controls were fed a high-fat diet supplemented or not with the PPAR&#x3b3; agonist rosiglitazone (30&#xa0;mg/kg/day) for 8&#xa0;weeks and evaluated for iWAT mass, lipidome, transcriptome (Rnaseq), respiration and BCAA metabolism. Adipocyte mTORC1 deficiency not only impaired iWAT adiponectin transcription, synthesis and secretion, PEPCK mRNA levels, triacylglycerol synthesis and BCAA oxidation and mRNA levels of related proteins but also completely blocked the upregulation in these processes induced by pharmacological PPAR&#x3b3; activation with rosiglitazone. Mechanistically, adipocyte mTORC1 deficiency impairs PPAR&#x3b3; transcriptional activity by reducing PPAR&#x3b3; protein content, as well as by downregulating C/EBP&#x3b1;, a co-partner and facilitator of PPAR&#x3b3;. In conclusion, mTORC1 and PPAR&#x3b3; are essential partners involved in the regulation of subcutaneous adipose tissue adiponectin production and secretion and BCAA oxidative metabolism.",

    "abstract": "With this case report we support our medical hypothesis that metreleptin treatment ameliorates starvation related emotional, cognitive and behavioral symptomatology of anorexia nervosa (AN) and show for the first time strong effects in a male patient with AN. A 15.9 year old adolescent with severe AN of eight-month duration was treated off-label with metreleptin. Hyperactivity was assessed with accelerometry. Visual analogue scales (VAS), validated self- and clinician rating scales and lab results tracked changes from baseline to end of the 24-day dosing period and a five-month follow-up. Substantial improvements of mood and eating disorder related cognitions and hyperactivity set in after two days of treatment. During dosing, sub-physiological testosterone and TT3 levels normalized; clinically libido reemerged. Weight did not increase substantially during the dosing period. During follow-up target weight was attained; mood did not deteriorate; hyperactivity ceased. The results substantiate the strong effects seen in female cases and underscore the need for a double-blind placebo-controlled trial to confirm the observed strong, multiple and rapid onset beneficial effects of metreleptin in AN.",

    "abstract": "Produced by adipocytes, adiponectin crosses the blood-brain barrier to bind with specific receptors in the hypothalamus, brainstem, hippocampus, and cortex. In patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), circulating levels of adiponectin inversely related with antidepressant response to ketamine, and predicted a better response to multi-target drug combinations than to escitalopram. We investigated the effect of adiponectin on response to antidepressants in a naturalistic setting. We assessed baseline plasma levels of adiponectin in 121 MDD inpatients, treated with antidepressant drug monotherapy based on clinical need (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine, duloxetine) in a specialized hospital setting. Severity of depression was weekly assessed with Hamilton scale ratings. Adiponectin plasma levels were higher in patients with MDD compared with healthy controls, and negatively influenced the pattern of antidepressant response (higher baseline levels, worse response) independent of the drug class and of the baseline severity of depression, and of age, sex, and body mass index. The identification of adiponectin as a predictor of antidepressant response to drugs of different mechanism of action, such as ketamine, SSRIs, and SNRIs, and both in experimental and in clinical settings, warrants interest for further study of its pathways to search for novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Since its discovery in 1994, leptin continues to have new potential physiological roles uncovered, including a role in the regulation of blood flow. Leptin's role in regulating blood flow is not completely understood. Red blood cell (RBC)-derived ATP is a recognized stimulus of blood flow, and multiple studies suggest that C-peptide, a hormone secreted in equimolar amounts with insulin from the pancreatic &#x3b2;-cells, can stimulate that release when delivered by albumin and in combination with Zn<sup>2+</sup>. Here, we report leptin delivers C-peptide and Zn<sup>2+</sup> to RBCs in a saturable and specific manner. We labeled leptin with technetium-99 m (<sup>99m</sup>Tc) to perform binding studies while using albumin to block the specific binding of <sup>99m</sup>Tc-leptin in the presence or absence of C-peptide. Our results suggest that leptin has a saturable and specific binding site on the RBC ((Kd = 1.79 &#xb1; 0.46) &#xd7; 10<sup>-7</sup> M) that is statistically equal to the binding affinity in the presence of 20 nM C-peptide ((Kd = 2.05 &#xb1; 0.20) &#xd7; 10<sup>-7</sup> M). While the binding affinity between leptin and the RBC did not change with C-peptide, the moles of bound leptin did increase with C-peptide, suggesting a separate binding site on the cell for a leptin/C-peptide complex. The RBC-derived ATP increased in the presence of a leptin/C-peptide/Zn<sup>2+</sup> addition, in a concentration-dependent manner. Control RBCs ATP release increased (71 &#xb1; 5.6%) in the presence of C-peptide and Zn<sup>2+</sup>, which increased further to (94 &#xb1; 5.6%) in the presence of Zn<sup>2+</sup>, C-peptide, and leptin.",

    "abstract": "Gene therapy has become the most effective treatment for monogenic diseases. Congenital LEPTIN deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive monogenic obesity syndrome caused by mutations in the Leptin gene. Ob/ob mouse is a monogenic obesity model, which carries a homozygous point mutation of C to T in Exon 2 of the Leptin gene. Here, we attempted to edit the mutated Leptin gene in ob/ob mice preadipocytes and inguinal adipose tissues using CRISPR/Cas9 to correct the C to T mutation and restore the production of LEPTIN protein by adipocytes. The edited preadipocytes exhibit a correction of 5.5% of Leptin alleles and produce normal LEPTIN protein when differentiated into mature adipocytes. The ob/ob mice display correction of 1.67% of Leptin alleles, which is sufficient to restore the production and physiological functions of LEPTIN protein, such as suppressing appetite and alleviating insulin resistance. Our study suggests CRISPR/Cas9-mediated in situ genome editing as a feasible therapeutic strategy for human monogenic diseases, and paves the way for further research on efficient delivery system in potential future clinical application.",

    "abstract": "The excess deposition of underlying extracellular matrix (ECM) in adipose tissue is defined as adipose tissue fibrosis that is a major contributor to metabolic disorder such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Anti-fibrosis therapy has received much attention in the treatment of metabolic disorders. Orosomucoid (ORM) is an acute-phase protein mainly produced by liver, which is also an adipokine. In this study, we investigated the effects of ORM on adipose tissue fibrosis and the potential mechanisms. We showed that ORM1-deficient mice exhibited an obese phenotype, manifested by excessive collagen deposition in adipose tissues and elevated expression of ECM regulators such as metalloproteinases (MMP-2, MMP-13, MMP-14) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1, TIMP-2, TIMP-3). Administration of exogenous ORM (50&#x2009;mg&#xb7;&#x2009;kg<sup>-1</sup>&#xb7;&#x2009;d<sup>-1</sup>, ip) for 7 consecutive days in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice and leptin receptor (LepR)-deficient db/db mice attenuated these abnormal expressions. Meanwhile, ORM administration stimulated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and decreased transforming growth factor-&#x3b2;1 (TGF-&#x3b2;1) level in adipose tissues of the mice. In TGF-&#x3b2;1-treated 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, ORM (10&#x2009;&#x3bc;g/mL) improved the impaired expression profiles of fibrosis-related genes, whereas a selective AMPK inhibitor dorsomorphin (1 &#x3bc;mol/mL) abolished these effects. Together, our results suggest that ORM exerts a direct anti-fibrosis effect in adipose tissue via AMPK activation. ORM is expected to become a novel target for the treatment of adipose tissue fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Recently, we and other researchers reported that brain metabolic disorders are implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive, devastating and incurable neurodegenerative disease. Hence, novel therapeutic approaches are urgently needed to explore potential and novel therapeutic targets/agents for the treatment of AD. The neuronal adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) is an emerging potential target for intervention in metabolic-associated AD. We aimed to validate this hypothesis and explore in-depth the therapeutic effects of an osmotin-derived adiponectin-mimetic novel nonapeptide (Os-pep) on metabolic-associated AD. We used an Os-pep dosage regimen (5&#x2009;&#x3bc;g/g, i.p., on alternating days for 45&#x2009;days) for APP/PS1 in amyloid &#x3b2; oligomer-injected, transgenic adiponectin knockout (Adipo-/-) and AdipoR1 knockdown mice. After behavioral studies, brain tissues were subjected to biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses. In separate cohorts of mice, electrophysiolocal and Golgi staining experiments were performed. To validate the in vivo studies, we used human APP Swedish (swe)/Indiana (ind)-overexpressing neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, which were subjected to knockdown of AdipoR1 and APMK with siRNAs, treated with Os-pep and other conditions as per the mechanistic approach, and we proceeded to perform further biochemical analyses. Our in vitro and in vivo results show that Os-pep has good safety and neuroprotection profiles and crosses the blood-brain barrier. We found reduced levels of neuronal AdipoR1 in human AD brain tissue. Os-pep stimulates AdipoR1 and its downstream target, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, in AD and Adipo-/- mice. Mechanistically, in all of the in vivo and in vitro studies, Os-pep rescued aberrant neuronal metabolism by reducing neuronal insulin resistance and activated downstream insulin signaling through regulation of AdipoR1/AMPK signaling to consequently improve the memory functions of the AD and Adipo-/- mice, which was associated with improved synaptic function and long-term potentiation via an AdipoR1-dependent mechanism. Our findings show that Os-pep activates AdipoR1/AMPK signaling and regulates neuronal insulin resistance and insulin signaling, which subsequently rescues memory deficits in AD and adiponectin-deficient models. Taken together, the results indicate that Os-pep, as an adiponectin-mimetic novel nonapeptide, is a valuable and promising potential therapeutic candidate to treat aberrant brain metabolism associated with AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common endocrine disorder worldwide. Recently, quercetin has been extensively investigated as a therapeutic option in patients with PCOS. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying quercetin's positive effects by modulating key components of energy homeostasis and adipose tissue hormones in rats with letrozole-induced PCOS. Eighteen female Wistar rats were divided into three groups including control group (received carboxy methylcellulose (CMC 0.5%)), letrozole-induced PCOS&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;quercetin group (received 1&#xa0;mg/kg letrozole in CMC 0.5%), and letrozole-induced PCOS +/+ quercetin group (received same dose of letrozole&#xa0;+&#xa0;100&#xa0;mg/kg quercetin in CMC 0.5%). The estrous cycle, biochemical and hormonal parameters, as well as insulin resistance (IR) were evaluated in all groups. Western blotting was used to assess the expression levels of sirtuin-1 (SIRT-1), 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and adiponectin in target tissues of rats. The expression levels of visfatin and resistin were also evaluated through Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Treatment with quercetin improved the PCOS related disturbances in estrous cycle, lipid profile, serum levels of testosterone, estradiol and progesterone, and IR. Besides, the expression levels of AMPK and SIRT-1 in ovarian tissue were upregulated in the rats which received quercetin. Quercetin also reversed the PCOS-induced alteration in adipose tissue levels of adiponectin, visfatin, and resistin. Modulation of energy homeostasis through key components involved in this axis, as well as regulation of hormones releasing from adipose tissue may be the main underlying mechanisms for positive effects of quercetin in PCOS.",

    "abstract": "Hyperleptinaemia is a well-established therapeutic side effect of drugs inhibiting the androgen axis in prostate cancer (PCa), including main stay androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and androgen targeted therapies (ATT). Given significant crossover between the adipokine hormone signalling of leptin and multiple cancer-promoting hallmark pathways, including growth, proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, metabolism and inflammation, targeting the leptin axis is therapeutically appealing, especially in advanced PCa where current therapies fail to be curative. In this study, we uncover leptin as a novel universal target in PCa and are the first to highlight increased intratumoural leptin and leptin receptor (LEPR) expression in PCa cells and patients' tumours exposed to androgen deprivation, as is observed in patients' tumours of metastatic and castrate resistant (CRPC) PCa. We also reveal the world-first preclinical evidence that demonstrates marked efficacy of targeted leptin-signalling blockade, using Allo-aca, a potent, specific, and safe LEPR peptide antagonist. Allo-aca-suppressed tumour growth and delayed progression to CRPC in mice bearing LNCaP xenografts, with reduced tumour vascularity and altered pathways of apoptosis, transcription/translation, and energetics in tumours determined as potential mechanisms underpinning anti-tumour efficacy.

    "title": "Countering adipose tissue dysfunction could underlie the superiority of telmisartan in the treatment of obesity-related hypertension.",
    "abstract": "The prevalence of hypertension and obesity has increased significantly in recent decades. Hypertension and obesity often coexist, and both are associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. Obese hypertensive patients usually require special anti-hypertensive treatment strategy due to the increased risk of treatment resistance. Molecules that can target both obesity and hypertension underlying pathologies should get more attention. Herein, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of telmisartan, with special interest in visceral adipose tissue dysfunction, in obesity-related hypertension rat model. Thirty male Wistar rats weighing 150-200&#xa0;g were equally divided into: 1-Control group (fed normal laboratory diet for 24&#xa0;weeks), 2-Diet-induced obesity group (DIO, fed high fat diet for 24&#xa0;weeks), and 3-Diet-induced obesity treated with telmisartan group (DIO&#x2009;+&#x2009;Tel, fed high fat diet and received telmisartan for 24&#xa0;weeks). At the end of the study, anthropometrical parameters were evaluated. Systolic blood pressure and heart rate were measured. Blood samples were collected for the measurement of serum lipids, adipokines, cardiac, renal, inflammatory, and oxidative stress biomarkers. Kidneys were removed and used for histopathological studies, and visceral adipose tissue was utilized for histopathological, immunohistochemical and RT-PCR studies. High fat diet resulted in obesity-related changes in anthropometrical parameters, elevation of blood pressure, increase in heart rate, higher serum levels of cardiac, inflammatory and kidney function biomarkers, with altered serum lipids, adipokines and oxidative stress markers. Morphological changes (H&amp;E and PAS-stained sections) were noticed in kidneys and visceral adipose tissue. Immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR studies confirmed adipose tissue dysfunction and over-expression of inflammatory and oxidative stress proteins. Telmisartan countered obesity-induced alterations in cardiovascular, renal, and adipose tissue functions. Adipose tissue dysfunction could be the core pathophysiology of obesity-related hypertension. Besides its anti-hypertensive effect, telmisartan had profound actions on visceral adipose tissue structure and function. Attention should be given to polymodal molecules targeting adipose tissue-related disorders.",

    "title": "Dickkopf (Dkk)-2 is a beige fat-enriched adipokine to regulate adipogenesis.",
    "abstract": "In the past decades, remarkable efforts have been made to unravel the regulation of adipose tissue metabolism, given the increasing prevalence of obesity and its huge impact on human health. Wnt signaling pathway is closely involved in this entity. As extracellular inhibitors to Wnt signaling, secreted protein Dickkopfs (Dkks) may be potential targets to combat obesity and related metabolic disorders. In this study, we showed that Dkk2 was a beige fat-enriched adipokine to regulate adipogenesis. Dkk2 was strikingly expressed in beige fat depot compared to classic white, brown, and subcutaneous fat. Dkk2 treatment inhibited adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes, C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells, and primary bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells. Activation of the master adipogenic factor PPAR&#x3b3; by the synthetic Thiazolidinedione ligand rosiglitazone largely rescued the inhibition of adipogenesis by Dkk2. Furthermore, adenoviral overexpression of Dkk2 in the liver to mimic its gain-of-function showed minimal effect on whole-body metabolism. These results collectively suggest that Dkk2 is a first-in-class beige fat adipokine and functions mainly through a paracrine manner to inhibit adipogenesis rather than as an endocrine factor. Our findings aid a better understanding of beige fat function and regulation and further, provide a potential therapeutic target for treating obesity.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, the complications related to diabetes, such as nephropathy, cardiovascular problems, and aging, are highly being considered. Renal cell aging is affected by various mechanisms of inflammation, oxidative stress, and basement membrane thickening, which are significant causes of renal dysfunction in diabetes. Due to recent studies, adiponectin plays a key role in diabetes-related kidney diseases as a fat-derived hormone. In diabetes, reduced adiponectin levels are associated to renal cell aging. Oxidative stress and related signaling pathways are the main routes in which adiponectin may be effective to decline diabetes-associated aging. Therefore, adiponectin signaling in target tissues becomes one of the research areas of interest in metabolism and clinical medicine. Studies on adiponectin signaling will increase our understanding of adiponectin role in diabetes-linked diseases as well as shortening life span conditions which may guide the design of antidiabetic and anti-aging drugs.",

    "title": "Adiponectin Deficiency Suppresses Rhabdomyosarcoma Associated with Gut Microbiota Regulation.",
    "abstract": "The gut microbiota is very important in the initiation, progression, and dissemination of cancer, and the regulation of microbiota has been employed as a novel strategy to enhance the effect of immunotherapy. Adiponectin (APN), an adipocyte-derived hormone, plays a vital role in regulating the immune response of innate immune cells. The deficiency of APN inhibits rhabdomyosarcoma growth. However, whether this function is associated with regulating gut microbiota remains unknown. To investigate, we performed 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing on the fecal microbiome of APN gene knockout mice to determine whether APN deletion affects the gut microbiota. We found APN deficiency alters gut microbial functions involved in metabolism, genetic information processing, and cellular processes. In addition, a decreased abundance of Bacteroides and an increased abundance of Prevotella and Helicobacter were observed in rhabdomyosarcoma-bearing APN knockout mice; these bacteria were associated with the inhibition of rhabdomyosarcoma growth. These findings suggest that gut microbiota may be a potential target of APN deficiency against rhabdomyosarcoma.",

    "title": "Brown/Beige adipose tissues and the emerging role of their secretory factors in improving metabolic health: The batokines.",
    "abstract": "Brown and beige adipose tissues are the primary sites for adaptive non-shivering thermogenesis. Although they have been known principally for their thermogenic effects, in recent years, it has emerged that, just like white adipose tissue (WAT), brown and beige adipose tissues also play an important role in the regulation of metabolic health through secretion of various brown adipokines (batokines) in response to various physiological cues. These secreted batokines target distant organs and tissues such as the liver, heart, skeletal muscles, brain, WAT, and perform various local and systemic functions in an autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine manner. Brown and beige adipose tissues are therefore now receiving increasing levels of attention with respect to their effects on various other organs and tissues. Identification of novel secreted factors by these tissues may help in the discovery of drug candidates for the treatment of various metabolic disorders such as obesity, type-2 diabetes, skeletal deformities, cardiovascular diseases, dyslipidemia. In this review, we comprehensively describe the emerging secretory role of brown/beige adipose tissues and the metabolic effects of various brown/beige adipose tissues secreted factors on other organs and tissues in endocrine/paracrine manners, and as well as on brown/beige adipose tissue itself in an autocrine manner. This will provide insights into understanding the potential secretory role of brown/beige adipose tissues in improving metabolic health.",

    "abstract": "Employing targeting ligands on the surface of liposomes has the great potential to improve therapeutic efficacy and decreases off-target effects of liposomal formulations. In the present study, a leptin-derived peptide (Lp31) was evaluated to optimize the therapeutic efficacy of PEGylated liposomal Doxorubicin (PLD, Caelyx&#xae;). Leptin is an appetite regulatory hormone that is secreted into the blood circulation by the adipose tissue and it functions via its over expressed receptors (Ob-R) in a wide variety of cancers. Lp31, as targeting ligand, was conjugated to Maleimide-PEG2000-DSPE and then post-inserted into Caelyx. The anti-tumor activity and therapeutic efficacy of leptin modified Caelyx were evaluated and compared with Caelyx. The in vitro experiments demonstrated enhanced cytotoxicity and cellular uptake of Lp31-targeted Caelyx in C26 cell line compared to Caelyx. In BALB/c mice bearing C-26 murine carcinoma, Lp31 modified Caelyx groups exhibited significantly higher doxorubicin concentration at tumor tissue. Furthermore, Lp31 modified Caelyx at the dose of 10 mg/kg resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition and enhanced survival time compared to Caelyx. According to these results, the novel Lp31-liposomal doxorubicin offers great promise for the treatment of colon cancer and merits further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Background. This study investigated the effect of non-surgical periodontal treatment on clinical indices and salivary levels of visfatin, chemerin, and progranulin in diabetic patients with periodontitis. Methods. This interventional clinical trial was performed on 20 patients with type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis (periodontitis stages II or III according to the new classification of periodontal diseases). Clinical indices, including gingival index (GI), probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL) and plaque index (PI), were recorded and visfatin, chemerin, and progranulin adipokines levels were also measured in unstimulated saliva by ELISA technique at baseline and twelve weeks after non-surgical periodontal treatment. Results. GI dropped from 1.92&#xb1;0.27 to 0.71&#xb1;0.14 after the intervention (P&lt;0.001). Also, there were significant changes in the PPD and PI (P&lt;0.001). However, no significant changes were observed in the CAL (P&lt;0.05). The concentrations of all three salivary adipokines decreased after treatment, but this change was statistically significant only for progranulin (P&lt;0.05). Conclusion. Non-surgical periodontal therapy resulted in improvements in the clinical indices of GI, PPD, and PI in T2DM patients with periodontitis. Moreover, the significant reduction in the salivary level of progranulin after treatment suggests that it might be considered a target inflammatory marker in periodontal diseases.",

    "abstract": "Bioflavonoids are the largest group of plant-derived polyphenolic compounds with diverse biological potential and have also been proven efficacious in the treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The present investigation validates molecular docking, simulation, and MM-PBSA studies of fifteen bioactive bioflavonoids derived from plants as a plausible potential antiviral in the treatment of COVID-19. Molecular docking studies for 15 flavonoids on the three SARS CoV-2 proteins, non-structural protein-15 Endoribonuclease (NSP15), the receptor-binding domain of spike protein (RBD of S protein), and main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>/3CL<sup>pro</sup>) were performed and selected protein-ligand complexes were subjected to Molecular Dynamics simulations. The molecular dynamics trajectories were subjected to free energy calculation by the MM-PBSA method. All flavonoids were further assessed for their effectiveness as adjuvant therapy by network pharmacology analysis on the target proteins. The network pharmacology analysis suggests the involvement of selected bioflavonoids in the modulation of multiple signaling pathways like p53, FoxO, MAPK, Wnt, Rap1, TNF, adipocytokine, and leukocyte transendothelial migration which plays a significant role in immunomodulation, minimizing the oxidative stress and inflammation. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies illustrated the potential of glycyrrhizic acid, amentoflavone, and mulberroside in inhibiting key SARS-CoV-2 proteins and these results could be exploited further in designing future ligands from natural sources.",

    "abstract": "Some adipokines, such as adiponectin (ADPN), other than being implicated in the central regulation of feeding behavior, may influence gastric motor responses, which are a source of peripheral signals that also influence food intake. The present study aims to elucidate the signaling pathways through which ADPN exerts its actions in the mouse gastric fundus. To this purpose, we used a multidisciplinary approach. The mechanical results showed that ADPN caused a decay of the strip basal tension, which was abolished by the nitric oxide (NO) synthesis inhibitor, L-N<sup>G</sup>-nitro arginine (L-NNA). The electrophysiological experiments confirmed that all ADPN effects were abolished by L-NNA, except for the reduction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> current, which was instead prevented by the inhibitor of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), dorsomorphin. The activation of the AMPK signaling by ADPN was confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis, which also revealed the ADPN R1 receptor (AdipoR1) expression in glial cells of the myenteric plexus. In conclusion, our results indicate that ADPN exerts an inhibitory action on the gastric smooth muscle by acting on AdipoR1 and involving the AMPK signaling pathway at the peripheral level. These findings provide novel bases for considering AMPK as a possible pharmacologic target for the potential treatment of obesity and eating disorders.",

    "title": "Adiponectin paradox as a therapeutic target of the cancer evolvability in aging.",
    "abstract": "Recent study suggests that protofibril-formation of amyloidogenic proteins (APs) might be involved in evolvability, an epigenetic inheritance of multiple stresses, in various biological systems. In cancer, evolvability of multiple APs, such as p53, &#x3b3;-synuclein and the members of the calcitonin family of peptides, might be involved in various features, including increased cell proliferation, metastasis and medical treatment resistance. In this context, the objective of this paper is to explore the potential therapeutic benefits of reduced APs evolvability against cancer. Notably, the same APs are involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease and cancer. Given the unsatisfactory outcomes of recent clinical trial of A&#x3b2; immunotherapy in Alzheimer's disease, it is possible that suppressing the aggregation of individual APs might also be not effective in cancer. As such, we highlight the adiponectin (APN) paradox that might be positioned upstream of AP aggregation in both neurodegenerative disease and cancer, as a common therapeutic target in both disease types. Provided that the APN paradox due to APN resistance under the diabetic conditions might promote AP aggregation, suppressing the APN paradox combined with antidiabetic treatments might be effective for the therapy of both neurodegenerative disease and cancer.",

    "title": "Peripheral and central regulation of insulin by the intestine and microbiome.",
    "abstract": "Blood glucose and insulin homeostasis is disrupted during the progression of type 2 diabetes. Insulin levels and action are regulated by both peripheral and central responses that involve the intestine and microbiome. The intestine and its microbiota process nutrients and generate molecules that influence blood glucose and insulin. Peripheral insulin regulation is regulated by gut-segment-dependent nutrient sensing and microbial factors such as short-chain fatty acids and bile acids that engage G-protein-coupled receptors. Innate immune sensing of gut-derived bacterial cell wall components and lipopolysaccharides also alter insulin homeostasis. These bacterial metabolites and postbiotics influence insulin secretion and insulin clearance in part by altering endocrine responses such as glucagon-like peptide-1. Gut-derived bacterial factors can promote inflammation and insulin resistance, but other postbiotics can be insulin sensitizers. In parallel, activation of small intestinal sirtuin 1 increases insulin sensitivity by reversing high fat-induced hypothalamic insulin resistance through a gut-brain neuronal axis, whereas high fat-feeding alters small intestinal microbiome and increases taurochenodeoxycholic acid in the plasma and the dorsal vagal complex to induce insulin resistance. In summary, emerging evidence indicates that intestinal molecular signaling involving nutrient sensing and the host-microbe symbiosis alters insulin homeostasis and action. Gut-derived host endocrine and paracrine factors as well as microbial metabolites act on the liver, pancreas, and the brain, and in parallel on the gut-brain neuronal axis. Understanding common nodes of peripheral and central insulin homeostasis and action may reveal new ways to target the intestinal host-microbe relationship in obesity, metabolic disease, and type 2 diabetes.",

    "title": "PVAT targets VSMCs to regulate vascular remodelling: angel or demon.",
    "abstract": "Vascular remodelling refers to abnormal changes in the structure and function of blood vessel walls caused by injury, and is the main pathological basis of cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and pulmonary hypertension. Among them, the neointimal hyperplasia caused by abnormal proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of vascular remodelling. Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) can release vasoactive substances to target VSMCs and regulate the pathological process of vascular remodelling. Specifically, PVAT can promote the conversion of VSMCs phenotype from contraction to synthesis by secreting visfatin, leptin, and resistin, and participate in the development of vascular remodelling-related diseases. Conversely, it can also inhibit the growth of VSMCs by secreting adiponectin and omentin to prevent neointimal hyperplasia and alleviate vascular remodelling. Therefore, exploring and developing new drugs or other treatments that facilitate the beneficial effects of PVAT on VSMCs is a potential strategy for prevention or treatment of vascular remodelling-related cardiovascular diseases.",

    "title": "The nutrient sensing pathways FoxO1/3 and mTOR in the heart are coordinately regulated by central leptin through PPAR&#x3b2;/&#x3b4;. Implications in cardiac remodeling.",
    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease in obese individuals with type 2 diabetes is often associated with hyperleptinemia and leptin resistance, while other studies support that leptin has cardioprotective effects. Besides, the role of leptin in regulating cardiac atrophy or hypertrophy remains to be clearly defined. In fact, in rats with normal leptin sensitivity, the molecular underpinnings of the effects of central leptin regulating cardiac structural pathways remain poorly understood. Hence, we assessed the effects of intracerebroventricular (icv) leptin infusion on cardiac remodeling analyzing FOXO1/3 and mTORC1 pathways, focusing special attention to PPAR&#x3b2;/&#x3b4; as mediator of central leptin's effects on cardiac metabolism. Male 3-months-old Wistar rats, infused with icv leptin (0.2&#x202f;&#x3bc;g/day) for 7&#x202f;days, were daily co-treated intraperitoneally with the specific PPAR&#x3b2;/&#x3b4; antagonist GSK0660, at 1&#x202f;mg/kg per day along leptin treatment. Central leptin regulated dynamically, in an opposite manner, the network between FOXOs and mTORC1 and induced an atrophy-related gene program in cardiac tissue. Leptin activated the anti-hypertrophic kinase GSK3&#x3b2; and increased the protein levels of muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases, muscle RING finger 1 (MuRF1) and muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx)/Atrogin-1 involved in limiting cardiac hypertrophy. FOXO1 activity and the expression of their target genes, Sod2 and Lpl, were also increased in the heart upon central leptin infusion. Besides, Beclin-1 and LC3B-II, gene products of the autophagic pathway response, were upregulated, while the content and expression levels of phenotypic markers of cardiac hypertrophy as ANP and &#x3b2;-myosin heavy chain, gene product of Myh7 were significantly decreased. On the other hand, mTORC1 activity and OXPHOS protein levels were decreased suggesting a key role of central leptin preventing cardiac oxidative stress. In fact, the content of carbonylated proteins, TBARS and ROS/RSN were not increased in cardiac tissue in response to central leptin infusion. Finally, the pharmacological inhibition of PPAR&#x3b2;/&#x3b4;, via in vivo administration of the selective antagonist GSK0660, blunted the induction of FOXO1/3, Atrogin-1, MuRF1 and GSK3&#x3b2; in the heart mediated by icv leptin infusion. Our results demonstrate that, in lean rats with normal leptin sensitivity, central leptin regulates nutrient sensing pathways in heart contributing to balance cardiac remodeling through the anti- and pro-hypertrophic programs, and in this process is involved PPAR&#x3b2;/&#x3b4;.",

    "abstract": "Resistin, a cysteine-rich secretory protein, has a pleiotropic role in humans. Resistin usually presents as trimer or hexamer in plasma, and targets specific receptors Toll Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) or Adenylyl Cyclase-Associated Protein 1 (CAP1). Upon binding to TLR4 and CAP1, resistin can trigger various intracellular signal transduction pathways to induce vascular inflammation, lipid accumulation, and plaque vulnerability. These pro-atherosclerotic effects of resistin appear in various cell types, including endothelial cells, vessel smooth muscle cells and macrophages, which cause diverse damages to cardiovascular system from dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis rupture and ventricular remodeling. In this review, we gather recent evidence about the pro- atherosclerotic effects of resistin and highlight it as a candidate therapeutic or diagnostic target for cardiovascular disease.",

    "abstract": "Liver fibrosis represents the wound healing response to sustained hepatic injury with activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). The I148M variant of the PNPLA3 gene represents a risk factor for development of severe liver fibrosis. Activated HSCs carrying the I148M variant display exacerbated pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrogenic features. We aimed to examine whether the I148M variant may impair Hedgehog and Yap signaling, as key pathways implicated in the control of energy expenditure and maintenance of myofibroblastic traits. First, we show that TGF-&#x3b2; rapidly up-regulated the PNPLA3 transcript and protein and Yap/Hedgehog target gene expression. In addition, HSCs overexpressing PNPLA3 I148M boosted anaerobic glycolysis, as supported by higher lactate release and decreased phosphorylation of the energy sensor AMPK. These cells displayed higher Yap and Hedgehog signaling, due to accumulation of total Yap protein, Yap promoter activity and increased downstream targets expression, compared to WT cells. HSCs exposed to TGF-&#x3b2; and leptin rapidly increased total Yap, together with a reduction in its inhibited form, phosphorylated Yap. In line, Yap-specific inhibitor Verteporfin strongly abolished Yap-mediated genes expression, at baseline as well as after TGF-&#x3b2; and leptin treatments in HSCs with I148M PNPLA3. Finally, Yap transcriptional activity was strongly reduced by a combination of Verteporfin and Rosiglitazone, a PPAR&#x3b3; synthetic agonist. In conclusion, HSCs carrying the PNPLA3 variant show activated Yap/Hedgehog pathways, resulting in altered anaerobic glycolysis and enhanced synthesis of Hedgehog markers and sustained Yap signaling. TGF-&#x3b2; and leptin exacerbate Yap/Hedgehog-related fibrogenic genes expression, while Yap inhibitors and PPAR&#x3b3; agonists abrogate these effects in PNPLA3 I148M carrying HSCs.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the protective effects of modified Linggui Zhugan Decoction (, MLZD), a traditional Chinese medicine formula, on obese type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats. Fifty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 5 groups by a random number table, including normal, obese T2DM (ob-T2DM), MLZD low-dose [MLDZ-L, 4.625 g/(kg&#xb7;d)], MLZD middle-dose [MLD-M, 9.25 g/(kg&#xb7;d) ] and MLZD high-dose [MLD-H, 18.5 g/(kg&#xb7;d)] groups, 10 rats in each group. After 4-week intervention, blood samples and liver, pancreas, muscle tissues were collected to assess the insulin resistance (IR), blood lipid, adipokines and inflammation cytokines. The alteration of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (PKB or Akt)/the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-ribosome protein subunit 6 kinase 1 (S6K1 )/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1 &#x3b1;) pathways were also studied. MLZD dose-dependently reduced fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, homeostasis model of assessment for IR index and increased insulin sensitive index compared with ob-T2DM rats (P&lt;0.05). Similarly, total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and free fatty acids were also decreased compared with ob-T2DM rats after 4-week treatment (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01). Improvements in adipokines and inflammatory cytokines were observed with a raised level of adiponectin and a reduced level of leptin, resistin, tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1; and interleukin-6 (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01). MLZD regulated the PI3K-Akt/mTOR-S6K1/AMPK-PGC-1 &#x3b1; pathways and restored the tissue structure of liver and pancreas (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01). MLZD ameliorated glycolipid metabolism and inflammation, which may be attributed to the regulation of PI3K-Akt/mTOR-S6K1/AMPK-PGC-1 &#x3b1; pathways.",

    "title": "Sirt3 regulates adipogenesis and adipokine secretion via its enzymatic activity.",
    "abstract": "The purpose of this research was to identify if Sirt3 plays a role in marrow adipogenesis and adipokines secretion, especially adiponectin using bone marrow-derived stroma (ST2) cell model. Sirt3 overexpression leads to a significant increase in adipogenesis compared to controls. The induction of adipogenesis by Sirt3 is associated with increased gene expression of adipocyte markers as well as adiponectin/adipokines. In sharp contrast, the inhibition of Sirt3 exhibited significantly decreased adipogenesis, adipocyte markers, and adiponectin/adipokines compared to the controls. Interestingly, perilipin 1 (Plin 1) expression was decreased in Sirt3 induction but increased in Sirt3 inhibition. One hundred and fifteen mitochondrial acetylated peptides from 67 mitochondrial proteins had lower levels of acetylation in adipocytes induced by Sirt3 overexpression (Sirt3OE) compared to the control. Of the 67 proteins less enriched in acetylation, 22 acetylated proteins were decreased by more than twofold. These proteins are considered potential Sirt3 substrates in adipogenesis. In conclusion, Sirt3 has a novel, important role in modulating adipogenesis and adiponectin/adipokine expression. The connection axis among Sirt3-adipogenesis-adipokines was linked to its substrates by mass spectrometry analysis. These findings contribute to the efforts of revealing Sirt3 functions and Sirt3 usage as a potential target for treatment of metabolic homeostasis and diseases including type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Complex liposomes were assembled with 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, dihexadecyl phosphate (DHDP), cholesterol and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (PA) to act as drug carriers for resveratrol (RES) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). The liposomes were modified with leptin (Lep) on the surface to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and to rescue degenerated dopaminergic neurons. The activity of RES and EGCG against neurotoxicity was investigated using an in vitro neurodegenerative model established by SH-SY5Y cells with an insult of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP<sup>+</sup>). The results indicated that increasing the mole percentage of DHDP and PA increased the particle size and absolute zeta potential value, and improved the entrapment efficiency of RES and EGCG; however, this increase reduced the release rate of RES and EGCG and the grafting efficiency of Lep. The ability of Lep/RES-EGCG-PA-liposomes to cross the BBB was found to be higher than that of non-modified liposomes. Further, the addition of PA and Lep into liposomes enhanced cell viability and target efficiency. The immunofluorescence results demonstrated that the conjugation of Lep with liposomes enabled the docking of HBMECs and SH-SY5Y cells via Lep receptor, and enhanced their ability to permeate the BBB and cellular uptake. Immunofluorescence and western blot analysis also revealed that RES and EGCG encapsulated into liposomes could be a neural defensive strategy by reducing the apoptosis promotor protein Bcl-2 associated X protein and &#x3b1;-synuclein, and enhancement in the apoptosis inhibitor protein B cell lymphoma 2, tyrosine hydroxylase, and the dopamine transporter. Hence, Lep-PA-liposomes can be an excellent choice of potential delivery system for PD treatment.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the influences of adiponectin (APN) on the liver injury in sepsis rats and to explore whether it exerts a therapeutic effect through the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. A rat model of sepsis was established through cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) (CLP group), and APN treatment group (APN group) and control group were also set. The changes in the liver function-related indicators, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), were determined by automatic biochemistry analyzer, and the levels of tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1; (TNF-&#x3b1;), interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6 were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was employed to detect liver tissue injury, and the hepatocyte apoptosis and necrosis after intervention with APN were evaluated using in situ fluorescence staining. Moreover, the mRNA expression of APN in liver tissues was detected via quantitative Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR), and the expression levels of phosphorylated AMPK and mTOR proteins in liver tissue samples were determined using Western blotting. In terms of changes in liver function-related indicators, the concentrations of ALT and AST were substantially raised in the CLP group, and compared with those in the control group, the concentrations of the two indicators significantly declined in the APN group, showing statistically significant differences (p&lt;0.05). CLP and APN group had evidently higher levels of inflammatory factors than the control group, but their levels in APN group were notably lower than those in the CLP group (p&lt;0.05). It was found through the HE staining that the sepsis rats in CLP group had massive inflammatory cell infiltration, and that the inflammatory cells were remarkably decreased in the APN group after APN treatment. According to the in-situ fluorescence staining detection results, CLP group exhibited a notable increase in the cell apoptosis rate, and APN group had substantially reduced apoptotic cells (p&lt;0.05). The determination results of APN expression revealed that CLP group had a lowered level of APN, and that the level of APN in APN group was markedly higher than that in the control group. Based on the results of Western blotting, the level of phosphorylated AMPK was remarkably elevated, and that of phosphorylated mTOR was lowered in the CLP group compared with those in the control group, while in comparison with CLP group, APN group showed a considerable elevation of phosphorylated AMPK level and a distinct decline in the phosphorylated mTOR level. APN can activate the AMPK/mTOR pathway and reduce hepatocyte apoptosis to alleviate liver injury in sepsis rats.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is one of the major modifiable risk factors in breast cancer, with obese adipose tissue showing a pathological role in breast cancer development and malignancy via the release of secretory factors, such as proinflammatory cytokines and adipocytokines. The current article focuses on visfatin and resistin, two such adipocytokines that have emerged over the last two decades as leading breast cancer promoting factors in obesity. The clinical association of circulating visfatin and resistin with breast cancer and their biological mechanisms are reviewed, in addition to their role in the context of tumor-stromal interactions in the breast cancer microenvironment. Recent findings have unraveled several mediators of visfatin and resistin that are involved in the crosstalk between breast cancer cells and adipose tissue in the breast tumor microenvironment, including growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Finally, current therapeutics targeting visfatin and resistin and their respective pathways are discussed, including future therapeutic strategies such as new drug design or neutralizing peptides that target extracellular visfatin or resistin. These hold promise in the development of novel breast cancer therapies and are of increasing relevance as the prevalence of obesity-related breast cancer increases worldwide.",

Chronic administration of recombinant FGF21 or engineered variants improves metabolic health in rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans; however, the rapid turnover of these molecules limits therapeutic utility. Here we show that the bispecific anti-FGFR1/KLB agonist antibody BFKB8488A induced marked weight loss in obese cynomolgus monkeys while elevating serum adiponectin and the adipose expression of FGFR1 target genes, demonstrating its action as an FGF21 mimetic. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, single ascending-dose study in overweight/obese human participants, subcutaneous BFKB8488A injection caused transient body weight reduction, sustained improvement in cardiometabolic parameters, and a trend toward reduction in preference for sweet taste and carbohydrate intake. These data suggest that specific activation of the FGFR1/KLB complex in humans can be used as therapy for obesity-related metabolic defects.",

Jonsell, investigate its insulin-sensitizing &amp; anti-NASH potentialities and address its molecular targets in IR-NASH pathogenesis. NRF was prepared using natural autolysis method and compounds were identified. Then, seventy male Wistar rats were feed high fat diet (HFD) or normal pellets for 35 days. In day 14th, HFD rats were injected by Streptozotocin (STZ) once and treatment was started in day 21st with either NRF (30, 60 and 120&#xa0;mg/kg; orally) or pioglitazone (PioG) (10&#xa0;mg/kg; i.p) beside HFD. While, NRF-alone rats were treated with NRF (120&#xa0;mg/kg; orally) beside the normal pellets. Body weight, glucose homeostasis, hepatopathological examinations were performed. Gas liquid chromatography-mass spectrophotometry (GLC/MS) was used for compounds' identification while spectrophotometer was used for total glucosinolates (GLS) quantification. Also, the biochemical and molecular investigations concerned with liver lipotoxicity, oxidative stress, inflammation and insulin signaling pathway were investigated and confirmed with the computational prediction of the major compounds' targets. Butenyl and benzyl GLS were the major along with other volatile compounds. NRF had significantly increased the insulin sensitivity and improved NASH-hisptopathology showing hepatoprotective effect. While, the fraction's anti-NASH potentiality was evidenced in the normalized hepatic steatosis markers, inflammation and oxidative stress key transcriptional factors resulting in induction of insulin receptor substrates (IRSs) phosphorylation and its downstream effectors.

    "title": "Leptin Contributes to Neuropathic Pain via Extrasynaptic NMDAR-nNOS Activation.",
    "abstract": "Leptin is an adipocytokine that is primarily secreted by white adipose tissue, and it contributes to the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain in collaboration with N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). Functional NMDARs are a heteromeric complex that primarily comprise two NR1 subunits and two NR2 subunits. NR2A is preferentially located at synaptic sites, and NR2B is enriched at extrasynaptic sites. The roles of synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDARs in the contribution of leptin to neuropathic pain are not clear. The present study examined whether the important role of leptin in neuropathic pain was related to synaptic or extrasynaptic NMDARs. We used a rat model of spared nerve injury (SNI) and demonstrated that the intrathecal administration of the NR2A-selective antagonist NVP-AAM077 and the NR2B-selective antagonist Ro25-6981 prevented and&#x2002;reversed&#x2002;mechanical allodynia following SNI. Administration of exogenous leptin mimicked SNI-induced behavioral allodynia, which was also prevented by NVP-AAM077 and Ro25-6981. Mechanistic studies showed that leptin enhanced NR2B- but not NR2A-mediated currents in spinal lamina II neurons of na&#xef;ve rats. Leptin also upregulated the expression of NR2B, which was blocked by the NR2B-selective antagonist Ro25-6981, in cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Leptin enhanced neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) expression, which was also blocked by Ro25-6981, in cultured DRG cells. However, leptin did not change NR2A expression, and the NR2A-selective antagonist NVP-AAM077 had no effect on leptin-enhanced nNOS expression. Our data suggest an important cellular link between the spinal effects of leptin and the extrasynaptic NMDAR-nNOS-mediated cellular mechanism of neuropathic pain.",

    "abstract": "The ovine choroid plexus (ChP) expresses the long isoform of the leptin receptor, which makes this structure a potential target for leptin action. In sheep, leptin concentration in plasma is higher during long days (LD) than short days (SD). This study evaluates the influence a of photoperiod on leptin impact on the gene expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), proinflammatory cytokines (IL1B, IL6), their receptors (IL1R1, IL1R2, ILRN, IL6R, IL6ST) and inflammasome components necessary for pro-IL-1&#x3b2; activation (NLRP3, PYCARD, CASP1), chemokine (CCL2), leptin receptor isoforms (LEPRa, LEPRb) and a suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS3) in the ChP of ewes treated or not with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Studies were conducted on adult female sheep divided into four groups (n = 6 in each): control, leptin (20 &#x3bc;g/kg), LPS (400 ng/kg), and LPS and leptin injected under SD and LD photoperiods. The leptin alone did not affect the gene expression but in co-treatment with LPS increased (p &lt; 0.05) IL1B but only during SD, and SOCS3, IL1R2, IL1RN, IL6ST and CCL2 only during LD, and decreased (p &lt; 0.05) the IL1R1 expression only during SD photoperiod. This indicates that the immunomodulatory action of leptin on the ChP is manifested only under the LPS challenge and is photoperiodically dependent.",

    "title": "Prevention of Nonalcoholic Hepatic Steatosis by Shenling Baizhu Powder: Involvement of Adiponectin-Induced Inhibition of Hepatic SREBP-1c.",
    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common chronic liver disease worldwide, and its incidence is increasing annually, but there is currently no specific drug for treating NAFLD. Shenling Baizhu powder (SL) is a safe herbal compound commonly used in clinical practice. Our previous research has shown that SL has the effect of preventing NAFLD, but its specific mechanism has not been determined. In this study, the potential mechanism of SL on NAFLD was explored by in vivo experiments. Wistar rats fed a choline-deficient amino acid-defined diet (CDAA) were treated with SL for 8 weeks. Then, serum samples were collected to obtain biochemical indicators; adipose tissue and liver samples were collected for pathological detection; a moorFLPI-2 blood flow imager was used to measure liver microcirculation blood flow, and a rat cytokine array was used to screen potential target proteins. The expression of liver adiponectin/SREBP-1c pathway-related proteins was determined by Western blotting. SL effectively reduced the liver wet weight, as well as the levels of total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) in the liver, and ameliorated liver injury in CDAA-fed rats. Pathological examinations showed that SL markedly reduced liver lipid droplets and improved liver lipid accumulation. In addition, the detection of liver blood flow showed that SL increased liver microcirculation in CDAA-fed rats. Through the cytokine array, a differentially expressed cytokine, namely, adiponectin, was screened in the liver. Western blotting assays showed that SL increased the expression of adiponectin and phosphoacetyl-CoA Carboxylase (p-ACC) in the liver and decreased the expression of steroid regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and fatty acid synthase (FAS). These results suggest that SL can increase the levels of adiponectin in the liver and serum and can inhibit the expression of SREBP-1c, thereby regulating systemic lipid metabolism and reducing liver lipid accumulation.",

    "abstract": "In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), motor neuron degeneration occurs simultaneously with systemic metabolic dysfunction and neuro-inflammation. The fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) plays an important role in the regulation of both phenomena and is a major hormone of energetic homeostasis. In this study, we aimed to determine the relevance of FGF21 pathway stimulation in a male mouse model of ALS (mutated SOD1-G93A mice) by using a pharmacological agonist of FGF21, R1Mab1. Mice (SOD1-WT and mutant SOD1-G93A) were treated with R1Mab1 or vehicle. Longitudinal data about clinical status (motor function, body weight) and biological parameters (including hormonal, immunological, and metabolomics profiles) were collected from the first symptoms to euthanasia at week 20. Multivariate models were performed to identify the main parameters associated with R1Mab1 treatment and to link them with clinical status, and metabolic pathways involving the discriminant metabolites were also determined. A beneficial clinical effect of R1Mab1 was revealed on slow rotarod (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.032), despite a significant decrease in body weight of ALS mice (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). We observed a decrease in serum TNF-&#x3b1;, MCP-1, and insulin levels (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0059, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003, and p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01, respectively). At 16&#xa0;weeks, metabolomics analyses revealed a clear discrimination (CV-ANOVA&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0086) according to the treatment and the most discriminant pathways, including sphingolipid metabolism, butanoate metabolism, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, and the metabolism of amino acids like tyrosine, arginine, proline, glycine, serine, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate. Mice treated with R1Mab1 had mildly higher performance on slow rotarod despite a decrease on body weight and could be linked with the anti-inflammatory effect of R1Mab1. These results indicate that FGF21 pathway is an interesting target in ALS, with a slight improvement in motor function combined with metabolic and anti-inflammatory effects.",

    "abstract": "Metformin is a widely used glucose-lowering drug, although its impact on adipose tissue function remains elusive. Adipose tissue-derived molecules regulate diverse physiological mechanisms, including energy metabolism, insulin sensitization, and inflammatory response. Alternatively, it has remained relevant to understand the therapeutic regulation of adipokines in efforts to alleviate inflammation in conditions associated with the metabolic syndrome. The current qualitative analysis of available literature focused on randomized clinical trials (RCTs) assessing the association between administration of metformin and adipokine regulation in individuals with metabolic syndrome. The major electronic databases such as MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and EMBASE were searched for eligible RCTs. Overall, 13 RCTs met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 4605 participants. Patients with metabolic syndrome were characterized by a state of obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. Cumulative evidence from these RCTs supported the blood glucose lowering effects of metformin, in addition to promoting weight loss, ameliorating insulin resistance, and reducing pro-inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1; in patients with metabolic syndrome. Importantly, these therapeutic effects are associated with the upregulation of adiponectin and suppression of leptin and resistin.",

    "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX) is an anthracycline derivative and widely used as an anticancer drug. However, the severe cardiotoxicity of DOX limits its application. ADP355 is an adiponectin-based active peptide with anti-liver fibrosis and atherosclerosis properties. It remains unclear the effects and involved mechanisms of ADP355 in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. C57BL/6J mice were intraperitoneally injected DOX once a week to induce heart failure while receiving ADP355 treatment daily for 4 weeks. At the end of experiment, blood and heart tissues were collected. We found that ADP355 markedly improved DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction and histopathological damage, and decreased serum creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase levels. The anti-apoptotic activity of ADP355 was indicated by reduction in TUNEL-positive cells and cleaved caspase-3 expression, along with decreased BCL2-associated X protein/B cell lymphoma 2 (BAX/BCL2) levels in heart tissues. Additionally, ADP355 markedly increased DOX-decreased cell viability by reducing BAX/BCL2, but inhibited reactive oxygen species production in H9c2 cells. Mechanistically, ADP355 attenuated expression of DOX-reduced nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and superoxide dismutase 2, as well as mRNA levels of Nrf2 downstream targets. Furthermore, ADP355 activated sirtuin 2 and its target genes. In conclusion, we demonstrate that ADP355 alleviates DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by inhibiting myocardial apoptosis and oxidative stress through Nrf2 and sirtuin 2 signaling pathways. These findings suggest that ADP355 can be a promising candidate for the treatment of cardiac dysfunction.",

    "title": "Adiponectin: The Potential Regulator and Therapeutic Target of Obesity and Alzheimer's Disease.",
    "abstract": "Animal and human mechanistic studies have consistently shown an association between obesity and Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD, a degenerative brain disease, is the most common cause of dementia and is characterized by the presence of extracellular amyloid beta (A&#x3b2;) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles disposition. Some studies have recently demonstrated that A&#x3b2; and tau cannot fully explain the pathophysiological development of AD and that metabolic disease factors, such as insulin, adiponectin, and antioxidants, are important for the sporadic onset of nongenetic AD. Obesity prevention and treatment can be an efficacious and safe approach to AD prevention. Adiponectin is a benign adipokine that sensitizes the insulin receptor signaling pathway and suppresses inflammation. It has been shown to be inversely correlated with adipose tissue dysfunction and may enhance the risk of AD because a range of neuroprotection adiponectin mechanisms is related to AD pathology alleviation. In this study, we summarize the recent progress that addresses the beneficial effects and potential mechanisms of adiponectin in AD. Furthermore, we review recent studies on the diverse medications of adiponectin that could possibly be related to AD treatment, with a focus on their association with adiponectin. A better understanding of the neuroprotection roles of adiponectin will help clarify the precise underlying mechanism of AD development and progression.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#x3b3; coactivator 1&#x3b1; (PGC-1&#x3b1;), a major regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. MOTS-c (mitochondrial open reading frame of the 12S rRNA) is a biologically active mitochondrial-derived peptide encoded by mitochondrial DNA. It influences the mechanisms of obesity and diabetes. We hypothesised that the adiponectin pathway may regulate the production and/or secretion of MOTS-c in skeletal muscle. We aimed to determine whether exercise and adiponectin affect MOTS-c to improve insulin resistance in mice. To investigate this hypothesis, we used wild-type C57BL/6 mice subjected to high-fat diet, an exercise regimen, and i.p. injection of recombinant mouse adiponectin (Acrp30) or MOTS-c, and adiponectin knockout (Adipoq<sup>-/-</sup>) mice (C57BL/6 background) subjected to i.p. injection of Acrp30. C2C12 myotubes were also treated with sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) inhibitor, PGC-1&#x3b1; inhibitor, SIRT1 activator, plasmid-expressed active APPL1 (adaptor protein, phosphotyrosine interacting with PH domain and leucine zipper), pcDNA-SIRT1, or siRNA against APPL1, SIRT1 or PGC-1&#x3b1;. In Adipoq<sup>-/-</sup> mice, MOTS-c levels in the plasma and skeletal muscle were downregulated. In C2C12 myotubes, adiponectin increased the mRNA expression of MOTS-c. APPL1 protein level following adiponectin treatment positively correlated with MOTS-c protein and mRNA levels in C2C12 myotubes. SIRT1 overexpression increased the adiponectin-induced mRNA and protein expression of MOTS-c, SIRT1 and PGC-1&#x3b1;. Pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of PGC-1&#x3b1; suppressed the increases in MOTS-c mRNA and protein levels induced by SIRT1 overexpression. In mice, plasma and skeletal muscle MOTS-c levels were significantly downregulated following high-fat-diet. Exercise and i.p. Acrp30 or MOTS-c increased MOTS-c levels and adiponectin mRNA and protein expression in the plasma and skeletal muscle. Our findings showed that the APPL1-SIRT1-PGC-1&#x3b1; pathway regulates the production and/or secretion of skeletal muscle MOTS-c by mediating adiponectin signalling. Our study provides an insight into the cellular and molecular pathways underlying the pathogenesis of diabetes and shows that MOTS-c is a potential novel therapeutic target in the treatment of diabetes.

On the other hand, Wnt/&#x3b2;-catenin antagonists have been highlighted as promising strategy for type 2 diabetes management via up-regulating PPAR&#x3b3; gene expression. We aimed at synthesizing novel partial PPAR&#x3b3; agonists with &#x3b2;-catenin inhibitory activity which could enhance insulin sensitivity and avoid the side effects of full PPAR&#x3b3; agonists. We synthesized novel series of &#x3b1;-phthlimido-o-toluoyl-2-aminothiazoles hybrids for evaluating their antidiabetic activity and discovering its mechanistic pathway. We assessed effect of the new hybrids on PPAR&#x3b3; activation using a luciferase reporter assay system. Moreover, intracellular triglyceride levels, gene levels of c/EBP&#x3b1;, PPAR&#x3b3; and PPAR&#x3b3; targets including GLUT4, adiponectin, aP2 were measured in 3T3-L1 cells. Uptake of 2-DOG together with PPAR&#x3b3; and &#x3b2;-catenin protein levels were evaluated in 3T3-L1cells. In addition, molecular docking studies with PPAR&#x3b3; LBD, physicochemical properties and structure activity relationship of the novel hybrids were also studied. Three of the synthesized hybrids showed partial PPAR&#x3b3; agonistic activity and distinct PPAR&#x3b3; binding pattern. These compounds modulated PPAR&#x3b3; gene expression and PPAR&#x3b3; target genes; and increased glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 and slightly induced adipogenesis compared to rosiglitazone. Moreover, these compounds reduced &#x3b2;-catenin protein level which reflected in increased both PPAR&#x3b3; gene and protein levels that leads to improved insulin sensitivity and increased GLUT4 and adiponectin gene expression.

    "abstract": "Activation of the vascular endothelin-1 (ET-1) system is a key abnormality in vascular dysfunction of human obesity, especially in patients developing complications, such as the metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Vascular insulin resistance, an increased insulin-stimulated endothelial production of ET-1 combined with impaired nitric oxide availability, is the hallmark of obesity-related vasculopathy, but dysregulated adipokine release from obese adipose tissue may contribute to the predominance of ET-1-dependent vasoconstriction. ET-1, in turn, might determine unhealthy obese adipose tissue expansion, with visceral and perivascular adipose tissue changes driving the release of inflammatory cytokines and atherogenic chemokines. In addition, ET-1 might also play a role in the development of the metabolic complications of obesity. Studies have shown inhibition of lipoprotein lipase activity by ET-1, with consequent hypertriglyceridemia. Also, ET-1 in pancreatic islets seems to contribute to beta cell dysfunction, hence affecting insulin production and development of diabetes. Moreover, ET-1 may play a role in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Recent clinical trials using innovative design have demonstrated that antagonism of ET-type A receptors protects against some complications of obesity and diabetes, such as nephropathy. These findings encourage further investigation to evaluate whether targeting the ET-1 system could afford better protection against other consequences of the obesity epidemic.",

    "title": "AMP-activated protein kinase: An attractive therapeutic target for ischemia-reperfusion injury.",
    "abstract": "Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an energy sensor that regulates metabolic homeostasis. A growing body of literature has shown that AMPK activation exerts protective effects against I/R injury in heart, brain, kidney, liver, lung and intestine. In this review, we first reveal the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of AMPK activation against I/R injury in preclinical studies. We found that AMPK activation attenuates I/R injury via regulation of energy metabolism, oxidative stress, mitochondrial function, autophagy, inflammatory response, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Then, current therapeutic strategies (e.g., metformin, adiponectin) used to ameliorate I/R injury by modulating AMPK activity are reviewed in detail. Collectively, pharmacological activation of AMPK may hold a unique therapeutic potential in the prevention and attenuation of I/R injury.",

    "title": "Manipulation of Dietary Amino Acids Prevents and Reverses Obesity in Mice Through Multiple Mechanisms That Modulate Energy Homeostasis.",
    "abstract": "Reduced activation of energy metabolism increases adiposity in humans and other mammals. Thus, exploring dietary and molecular mechanisms able to improve energy metabolism is of paramount medical importance because such mechanisms can be leveraged as a therapy for obesity and related disorders. Here, we show that a designer protein-deprived diet enriched in free essential amino acids can 1) promote the brown fat thermogenic program and fatty acid oxidation, 2) stimulate uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-independent respiration in subcutaneous white fat, 3) change the gut microbiota composition, and 4) prevent and reverse obesity and dysregulated glucose homeostasis in multiple mouse models, prolonging the healthy life span. These effects are independent of unbalanced amino acid ratio, energy consumption, and intestinal calorie absorption. A brown fat-specific activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 seems involved in the diet-induced beneficial effects, as also strengthened by in vitro experiments. Hence, our results suggest that brown and white fat may be targets of specific amino acids to control UCP1-dependent and -independent thermogenesis, thereby contributing to the improvement of metabolic health.",

    "title": "Adipocytes protect fibroblasts from radiation-induced damage by adiponectin secretion.",
    "abstract": "Prostate and colon cancers are among the most common cancers diagnosed annually, and both often require treatment with radiation therapy. Advancement in radiation delivery techniques has led to highly accurate targeting of tumor and sparing of normal tissue; however, in the pelvic region it is anatomically difficult to avoid off-target radiation exposure to other organs. Chronically the effects of normal urogenital tissue exposure can lead to urinary frequency, urinary incontinence, proctitis, and erectile dysfunction. Most of these symptoms are caused by radiation-induced fibrosis and reduce the quality of life for cancer survivors. We have observed in animal models that the severity of radiation-induced fibrosis in normal tissue correlates to damaged fat reservoirs in the pelvic region. We hypothesize that adipocytes may secrete a factor that prevents the induction of radiation-associated fibrosis in normal tissues. In these studies we show that the adipokine, adiponectin, is secreted by primary mouse adipocytes and protects fibroblasts from radiation-induced cell death, myofibroblast formation, and senescence. Further, we demonstrated that adiponectin does not protect colorectal or prostate cancer cells from radiation-induced death. Thus, we propose that adiponectin, or its downstream pathway, would provide a novel target for adjuvant therapy when treating pelvic cancers with radiation therapy.",

In this study, the metabolic activity of oral delivery of ACN-loaded niosomes was investigated and evaluated in a diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice model. ACNs extracted from Vaccinium Meridionale by the supercritical fluid extraction method were loaded in niosomes. The niosomal formulation was physically characterized and further administrated in drinking water to obese, insulin resistant mouse. We evaluated the effect of ACN loaded niosomes on hyperglycemia, glucose and insulin intolerance and insulin blood levels in C57BL/6&#xa0;J mice fed with a high-fat diet. The ACN-loaded particles were moderately monodisperse, showed a negative surface charge and 57% encapsulation efficiency. The ACN-loaded niosomes ameliorated the insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in the DIO mice model. Additionally, they reduced animal weight and plasma insulin, glucose, leptin and total cholesterol levels in obese mice. ACN-loaded niosomes administration, as a functional drink, had a beneficial effect on the reversal of metabolic abnormalities associated with obesity.",

    "title": "Review on multifaceted involvement of perivascular adipose tissue in vascular pathology.",
    "abstract": "Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is a fat tissue deposit that encircles the vasculature. PVAT is traditionally known to protect the vasculature from external stimuli that could cause biological stress. In addition to the protective role of PVAT, it secretes certain biologically active substances known as adipokines that induce paracrine effects on proximate blood vessels. These adipokines influence vascular tones. There are different types of PVAT and they are phenotypically and functionally distinct. These are the white and brown PVATs. Under certain conditions, white PVAT could undergo phenotypic switch to attain a brown PVAT-like phenotype. This type of PVAT is referred to as Beige PVAT. The morphology of adipose tissue is influenced by species, age, and sex. These factors play significant roles in adipose tissue mass, functionality, paracrine activity, and predisposition to vascular diseases. The difficulty that is currently experienced in extrapolating animal models to human physiology could be traceable to these factors. Up till now, the involvement of PVAT in the development of vascular pathology is still not well understood. Brown and white PVAT contribute differently to vascular pathology. Thus, the PVAT could be a therapeutic target in curbing certain vascular diseases. In this review, knowledge would be updated on the multifaceted involvement of PVAT in vascular pathology and also explore its vascular therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological studies have shown that obese subjects have an increased risk of developing triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and an overall reduced survival. However, the relation between obesity and TNBC remains difficult to understand. We hypothesize that apelin, an adipokine whose levels are increased in obesity, could be a major factor contributing to both tumour growth and metastatization in TNBC obese patients. We observed that development of obesity under high-fat diet in TNBC tumour-bearing mice significantly increased tumour growth. By showing no effect of high-fat diet in obesity-resistant mice, we demonstrated the necessity to develop obesity-related disorders to increase tumour growth. Apelin mRNA expression was also increased in the subcutaneous adipose tissue and tumours of obese mice. We further highlighted that the reproduction of obesity-related levels of apelin in lean mice led to an increased TNBC growth and brain metastases formation. Finally, injections of the apelinergic antagonist F13A to obese mice significantly reduced TNBC growth, suggesting that apelinergic system interference could be an interesting therapeutic strategy in the context of obesity and TNBC.",

    "abstract": "The dried stem bark of Berberis vernae C.K.Schneid., known as Xiao-bo-pi in Chinese, is a representative anti-diabetic herb in traditional Tibetan medical system. However, its anti-diabetic mechanisms and active components remain unclear. In this study, <sup>1</sup>H NMR-based metabolomics, biochemistry assay, molecular docking, and network analysis were integrated to evaluate the anti-diabetic effects of B. vernae extract on type 2 diabetic rats, and to explore its active components and underlying mechanisms. Diabetes was induced by high-fat diet and streptozotocin. After 30 days of treatment, B. vernae extract significantly decreased the serum levels of fasting blood glucose, insulin, insulin resistance index, glycated serum protein, TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-1&#x3b2;, and IL-6, whereas significantly increased the serum levels of insulin sensitivity index in type 2 diabetic rats. A total of 28 endogenous metabolites were identified by <sup>1</sup>H NMR-based metabolomics, of which 9 metabolites that were changed by diabetes were significantly reversed by B. vernae extract. The constructed compound-protein-metabolite-disease (CPMD) interaction network revealed the correlation between chemical constituents, target proteins, differential metabolites, and type 2 diabetes. Ferulic acid 4-O-&#x3b2;-D-glucopyranoside, bufotenidine, jatrorrhizine, and berberine showed good hit rates for both the 30 disease-related proteins and 14 differential metabolites-related proteins, indicating that these four compounds might be the active ingredients of B. vernae against type 2 diabetes. Moreover, pathway analysis revealed that the anti-diabetic mechanisms of B. vernae might be related to its regulation of several metabolic pathways (e.g., butanoate metabolism) and disease-related signal pathways (e.g., adipocytokine signaling pathway). In summary, B. vernae exerts a significant anti-diabetic effect and has potential as a drug candidate for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) has been shown to reduce obesity and obesity-related complications, suggesting that factors that promote WAT browning may have applications in the development of therapeutic strategies for treating obesity. Here, we show that ablation of spinophilin (SPL), a ubiquitously expressed, multidomain scaffolding protein, increases metabolism and improves energy balance. Male and female SPL knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) littermate controls were fed a chow diet or a high-fat diet (HFD). Body weight, hepatic steatosis, glucose and insulin tolerance, physical activity, and expression of browning genes in adipose tissues were measured and compared. Male SPL knockout (KO) mice fed a chow diet were significantly leaner, had lower body weights, and exhibited better glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity than wild-type (WT) littermate controls. When fed an HFD, SPL KO mice were protected from increased body fat, weight gain, hepatic steatosis, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance. Physical activity of SPL KO mice was markedly increased compared with WT controls. Furthermore, expression of the brown adipocyte marker, uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1), and the mitochondrial activity markers, cd137 and c-idea, were significantly increased in visceral WAT (vWAT) of SPL KO mice, suggesting that SPL knockout protected the mice from HFD-induced obesity and its metabolic complications, at least in part, by promoting the browning of white adipocytes in vWAT. Our data identify a critical role of SPL in regulating glucose homeostasis, obesity, and adipocyte browning. These results suggest SPL may serve as a drug target for obesity and diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Hypertension (HT) is a disease associated with endothelial dysfunction which is related to some adipokines and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Our aim was to investigate roles of apelin, omentin-1, and vaspin in essential HT and to evaluate their relationships with other pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, trace elements, and oxidative stress. We also investigated these parameters to determine asymptomatic target organ damage period and grading essential hypertension. One hundred fifty-three patients diagnosed with essential hypertension and 45 healthy controls were included in the study. Hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure &gt; 140 mmHg and/or a diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mm Hg or current use of an antihypertensive medication. The patients who had secondary HT, other chronic metabolic, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular diseases were excluded. History and physical exam including detailed cardiovascular examination were performed in all participants. Adipokines, cytokines, trace elements, lipid peroxidation, and ischemia-modified albumin levels were measured in blood samples by biochemical methods. Vaspin, IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, selenium, and zinc levels were significantly lower in the HT group compared to healthy controls while omentin-1, TNF-&#x3b1;, copper, iron, MDA, SOD, and IMA-C levels were significantly higher in HT patients compared to controls. Multiple ordinal regression revealed that TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-10, and body mass index of patients were statistically significant independent predictors (P = 0.024, P = 0.019, and P = 0.032, respectively) for grading of HT. IL-4 and IL-10 were significantly higher in patients with asymptomatic target organ damage, compared to patients without asymptomatic target organ damage (P = 0.032 and P = 0.015, respectively). Our findings suggest that adipokines apelin, omentin, and vaspin may be involved in hypertension by a complex interaction with the anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines, trace elements, and oxidative stress pathways.",

    "abstract": "Adipokines influence energy metabolism and have effects on male reproduction, including spermatogenesis and/or Sertoli cell maturation; however, the relationship between these active proteins and androgens in testicular cells is limited. Here, we studied the impact of short-term exposure to flutamide (an anti-androgen that blocks androgen receptors) on the expression of chemerin, apelin, vaspin and their receptors (CCRL2, CMKLR1, GPR1, APLNR, GRP78, respectively) in adult rat testes. Moreover, the levels of expression of lipid metabolism-modulating proteins (PLIN1, perilipin1; TSPO, translocator protein) and intercellular adherens junction proteins (nectin-2 and afadin) were determined in testicular cells. Plasma levels of adipokines, testosterone and cholesterol were also evaluated. Gene expression techniques used included the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Western blot (WB) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The androgen-mediated effects observed post-flutamide treatment were found at the gonadal level as chemerin, apelin, and vaspin gene expression alterations at mRNA and protein levels were detected, whereas the cellular targets for these adipokines were recognised by localisation of respective receptors in testicular cells. Plasma concentrations of all adipokines were unchanged, whereas plasma cholesterol content and testosterone level increased after flutamide exposure. Differential distribution of adipokine receptors indicates potential para- or autocrine action of the adipokines within the rat testes. Additionally, changes in the expression of PLIN1 and TSPO, involved in the initial step of testosterone synthesis in Leydig cells, suggest that testicular cells represent a target of flutamide action. Increase in the gene expression of PLIN1 and TSPO and higher total plasma cholesterol content indicates enhanced availability of cholesterol in Leydig cells as a result of androgen-mediated effects of flutamide. Alterations in adherens junction protein expression in the testis confirm the flutamide efficacy in disruption of androgen signalling and presumably lead to impaired para- and autocrine communication, important for proper functioning of adipokines.",

    "abstract": "Qingfei Paidu decoction (QFPD), a multi-component herbal formula, has been widely used to treat COVID-19 in China. However, its active compounds and mechanisms of action are still unknown. Firstly, we divided QFPD into five functional units (FUs) according to the compatibility theory of traditional Chinese medicine. The corresponding common targets of the five FUs were all significantly enriched in Go Ontology (oxidoreductase activity, lipid metabolic process, homeostatic process, etc.), KEGG pathways (steroid biosynthesis, PPAR signaling pathway, adipocytokine signaling pathway, etc.), TTD diseases (chronic inflammatory diseases, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary Disease, etc.), miRNA (MIR183), kinase (CDK7) and TF (LXR). QFPD contained 257 specific targets in addition to HCoV, pneumonia and ACE2 co-expression proteins. Then, network topology analysis of the five components-target-pathway-disease networks yielded 67 active ingredients. In addition, ADMET estimations showed that 20 compounds passed the stringent lead-like criteria and in silico drug-likeness test with high gastrointestinal absorption and the median lethal dose (LD50 &gt; 1600 mg/kg). Moreover, 4 specific ingredients (M3, S1, X2 and O2) and 5 common ingredients (MS1, MX16, SX1, WO1 and XO1) of QFPD presented good molecular docking score for 2019-nCov structure and non-structure proteins. Finally, drug perturbation of COVID-19 network robustness showed that all five FUs may protect COVID-19 independently, and target 8 specifically expressed drug-attacked nodes which were related to the bacterial and viral responses, immune system, signaling transduction, etc. In conclusion, our new FUNP analysis showed that QFPD had a protection effect on COVID-19 by regulating a complex molecular network with safety and efficacy. Part of the mechanism was associated with the regulation of anti-viral, anti-inflammatory activity and metabolic programming.",

    "abstract": "Glycoproteins are important biomarkers for cancers, while most glycoproteomics biomarkers suffering from low sensitivity and specificity due to their uncharacterized glycan structures. AZGP1 is a potential biomarker for salivary diagnostics of lung cancer, which is used as a model glycoprotein in this study for method development. We initially analyzed salivary N-glycoproteome by using lectin affinity chromatography and more than 300&#xa0;N-glycoproteins were identified, including AZGP1. 7 gel spots of AZGP1 were resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and further confirmed by two-dimensional western blot as well as mass spectrometry. The isomeric glycan structures of AZGP1 in these spots were systematically characterized both at composition level and at structure level. Our results revealed 10 glycan compositions for salivary AZGP1, including core fucosylated glycans on Asn128 and sialylated glycans on Asn109 and Asn112. We further compared the glycan structures of salivary AZGP1 from lung cancer group and control group. Accordingly, 14 and 7 potential glycan structures were successfully revealed, respectively. In total, 15 glycan compositions and 22 potential glycan structures were identified and characterized for AZGP1, including some different structures with the same compositions. In particular, 5 potential glycan structures were identified as lung cancer unique signatures. Our developed strategy holds promise for thorough identification of glycan structures on a target glycoprotein biomarker. In-depth characterization of its glycan structures will ultimately enhance its sensitivity and specificity for cancer detection.",

    "abstract": "Dietary polyphenols including anthocyanins target multiple organs. We aimed to assess the involvement of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), leptin, insulin and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) in mediating metabolic beneficial effects of purified anthocyanin cyanidin-3-glucoside (Cy3G). Intestinal proglucagon gene (Gcg; encoding GLP-1) and liver Fgf21 expression were assessed in 6-wk-old male C57BL-6J mice fed a low-fat-diet (LFD; 10% of energy from fat), alone or with 1.6&#xa0;mg Cy3G/L in drinking water for 3 wk [experiment (Exp.) 1; n&#xa0;=&#xa0;5/group]. Similar mice were fed the LFD or a high-fat diet (HFD; 60% energy from fat) with or without Cy3G for 20 wk. Half of the mice administered Cy3G also received 4 broad-spectrum antibiotics (ABs) in drinking water between weeks 11 and 14, for a total of 6 groups (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;8/group). Metabolic tolerance tests were conducted between weeks 2 and 16. Relevant hormone gene expression and plasma hormone concentrations were assessed mainly at the end of 20 wk (Exp. 2). In Exp. 1, Cy3G administration increased ileal but not colonic Gcg level by 2-fold (P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05). In Exp. 2, Cy3G attenuated HFD-induced body-weight gain (20.3% at week 16), and improved glucose tolerance (26.5% at week 15) but not insulin tolerance. Although Cy3G had no effect on glucose tolerance in LFD mice, LFD/Cy3G/AB mice showed better glucose tolerance than LFD/Cy3G mice (23%). In contrast, HFD/Cy3G/AB mice showed worse glucose tolerance compared with HFD/Cy3G mice (15%). Beneficial effects of Cy3G in HFD mice were not associated with changes in plasma leptin, insulin or GLP-1 concentrations. However, Cy3G increased hepatic Fgf21 expression in mice in Exp. 1 by 4-fold and attenuated Fgf21 overexpression in HFD mice (Exp. 2, 22%), associated with increased expression of genes that encode FGFR1 and &#x3b2;-klotho (&gt;3-fold, P &lt;&#xa0;0.05). Dietary Cy3G may reduce body weight and exert metabolic homeostatic effects in mice via changes in hepatic FGF21.",

    "title": "Revealing the Common Mechanisms of Scutellarin in Angina Pectoris and Ischemic Stroke Treatment via a Network Pharmacology Approach.",
    "abstract": "To investigate the shared mechanisms of scutellarin in angina pectoris (AP) and ischemic stroke (IS) treatment. A network pharmacology approach was used to detect the potential mechanisms of scutellarin in AP and IS treatment by target prediction, protein-protein interaction (PPI) data collection, network construction, network analysis, and enrichment analysis. Furthermore, molecular docking simulation was employed to analyze the interaction between scutellarin and core targets. Two networks were established, including a disease-target network and a PPI network of scutellarin targets against AP and IS. Network analysis showed that 14 targets, namely, AKT1, VEGFA, JUN, ALB, MTOR, ESR1, MAPK8, HSP90AA1, NOS3, SERPINE1, FGA, F2, FOXO3, and STAT1, might be the therapeutic targets of scutellarin in AP and IS. Among them, NOS3 and F2 were recognized as the core targets. Additionally, molecular docking simulation confifirmed that scutellarin exhibited a relatively high potential for binding to the active sites of NOS3 and F2. Furthermore, enrichment analysis indicated that scutellarin might exert a therapeutic role in both AP and IS by regulating several important pathways, such as coagulation cascades, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) signaling pathway, forkhead box O (FoxO) signaling pathway, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, adipocytokine signaling pathway, insulin signaling pathway, insulin resistance, and estrogen signaling pathway. The shared underlying mechanisms of scutellarin on AP and IS treatment might be strongly associated with its vasorelaxant, anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative effects as well as its effect on improving lipid metabolism.",

    "title": "Leptin stimulates synaptogenesis in hippocampal neurons via KLF4 and SOCS3 inhibition of STAT3 signaling.",
    "abstract": "Normal development of neuronal connections in the hippocampus requires neurotrophic signals, including the cytokine leptin. During neonatal development, leptin induces formation and maturation of dendritic spines, the main sites of glutamatergic synapses in the hippocampal neurons. However, the molecular mechanisms for leptin-induced synaptogenesis are not entirely understood. In this study, we reveal two novel targets of leptin in developing hippocampal neurons and address their role in synaptogenesis. First target is Kruppel-Like Factor 4 (KLF4), which we identified using a genome-wide target analysis strategy. We show that leptin upregulates KLF4 in hippocampal neurons and that leptin signaling is important for KLF4 expression in vivo. Furthermore, KLF4 is required for leptin-induced synaptogenesis, as shKLF4 blocks and upregulation of KLF4 phenocopies it. We go on to show that KLF4 requires its signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) binding site and thus potentially blocks STAT3 activity to induce synaptogenesis. Second, we show that leptin increases the expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), another well-known inhibitor of STAT3, in developing hippocampal neurons. SOCS3 is also required for leptin-induced synaptogenesis and sufficient to stimulate it alone. Finally, we show that constitutively active STAT3 blocks the effects of leptin on spine formation, while the targeted knockdown of STAT3 is sufficient to induce it. Overall, our data demonstrate that leptin increases the expression of both KLF4 and SOCS3, inhibiting the activity of STAT3 in the hippocampal neurons and resulting in the enhancement of glutamatergic synaptogenesis during neonatal development.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the effects of C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein-3 (CTRP3) on postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) and elucidate the potential regulatory mechanism in sevoflurane anesthesia-induced aged rats. A sevoflurane anesthesia-induced POCD aged rat model was established and hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining was used to detect pathological changes of hippocampal neurons. Morris water maze task test was performed to determine the learning and memory ability of rats. Immunofluorescence, quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot were used to detect CTRP3 expression. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or qRT-PCR assays were used to evaluate the changes of markers of brain damage and inflammatory cytokines. Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay was used to assess the apoptosis of nerve cells in hippocampus. Western blot assay were used to measure the expression levels of apoptosis-related protein, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/SIRT1 and PI3K/AKT pathway. Sevoflurane exposure led to brain injury, cognitive dysfunction in aged rats and decreased the expression of CTRP3. Overexpression of CTRP3 could suppress nerve cell apoptosis, inhibit neuronal inflammation, reduce brain tissue damage and improve cognitive dysfunction of aged rats after sevoflurane anesthesia. Further studies showed that CTRP3 may play a role in POCD by regulating AMPK/SIRT1 and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. CTRP3 may effectively protect against sevoflurane-induced cognitive dysfunction and served as a potential predictive indicator and therapy target for POCD.",

    "abstract": "Vascular calcification (VC) is commonly associated with bone loss in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The Wingless-related integration site (Wnt) regulates osteoblast activation through canonical signaling pathways, but the common pathophysiology of these pathways during VC and bone loss has not been identified. A rat model of adenine-induced CKD with VC was used in this study. The rats were fed 0.75% adenine (2.5% protein, 0.92% phosphate) with or without intraperitoneal injection of calcitriol (0.08 &#xb5;g/kg/day) for 4 weeks. Angiotensin II (3 &#xb5;M)-induced VC was achieved in high phosphate medium (3 mM) through its effect on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). In an mRNA profiler polymerase chain reaction assay of the Wnt signaling pathway, secreted frizzled-related protein 5 (sFRP5) levels were significantly decreased in the CKD rat model compared with the control group. The repression of sFRP5 on VSMC trans-differentiation was mediated through Rho/Rho-associated coiled coil containing protein kinase (ROCK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways activated by Wnt3a. In a proof of concept study conducted with patients with CKD, serum sFRP5 concentrations were significantly lower in subjects with VC than in those without VC. Our findings suggest that repression of sFRP5 is associated with VC in the CKD environment via activation of the noncanonical Wnt pathway, and thus that sFRP5 might be a novel therapeutic target for VC in CKD.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation and remodelling of orbital tissue associated with enhanced adipogenesis commonly occur in Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO), however, the underlying mechanisms that link immune cells and adipocytes in orbital inflammation are not well-known. The primary aim of this study was to elucidate how a genetically determined shift in the T-cell repertoire toward self-reactive T-cells could drive orbital adipogenesis. To induce the T-cell-mediated autoimmune response, SKG mice were intraperitoneally injected with zymosan A once at 8 weeks of age. After three months, orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), histopathologic studies, and in vitro analyses were performed to evaluate inflammation and adipogenesis. The eyes of the zymosan A-treated SKG mice displayed proptosis and blepharitis. A detailed analysis of orbital adipose tissue showed enhanced orbital adipogenesis and cellular infiltration compared to controls. In addition, increased secretion of adipokines and other cytokines in the periorbital tissue was observed, together with elevated serum concentration of inflammatory cytokines. Orbital adipogenesis was enhanced in zymosan A-treated SKG mice, a novel mouse model for GO-like inflammatory adipose phenotypes most likely induced by T-cell mediated autoimmune responses. This mouse model gives us the opportunity to examine the underlying molecular mechanisms of enhanced adipogenesis in GO, ultimately providing a potential therapeutic target alternative to conventional GO treatment.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin (ApN) is a hormone abundantly secreted by adipocytes and it is known to be tightly linked to the metabolic syndrome. It promotes insulin-sensitizing, fat-burning, and anti-atherosclerotic actions, thereby effectively counteracting several metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases. ApN is also known today to possess powerful anti-inflammatory/oxidative and pro-myogenic effects on skeletal muscles exposed to acute or chronic inflammation and injury, mainly through AdipoR1 (ApN specific muscle receptor) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, but also via T-cadherin. In this review, we will report all the beneficial and protective properties that ApN can exert, specifically on the skeletal muscle as a target tissue. We will highlight its effects and mechanisms of action, first in healthy skeletal muscle including exercised muscle, and second in diseased muscle from a variety of pathological conditions. In the end, we will go over some of AdipoRs agonists that can be easily produced and administered, and which can greatly mimic ApN. These interesting and newly identified molecules could pave the way towards future therapeutic approaches to potentially prevent or combat not only skeletal muscle disorders but also a plethora of other diseases with sterile inflammation or metabolic dysfunction.",

    "title": "Globular CTRP9 protects cardiomyocytes from palmitic acid-induced oxidative stress by enhancing autophagic flux.",
    "abstract": "Oxidative stress in cardiac myocytes is an important pathogenesis of cardiac lipotoxicity. Autophagy is a cellular self-digestion process that can selectively remove damaged organelles under oxidative stress, and thus presents a potential therapeutic target against cardiac lipotoxicity. Globular CTRP9 (gCTRP9) is a newly identified adiponectin paralog with established metabolic regulatory properties. The aim of this work is to investigate whether autophagy participates the protection effects of gCTRP9 in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (NRCMs) under oxidative stress and the underlying mechanism. NRCMs were treated with PA of various concentrations for indicated time period. Our results showed that PA enhanced intracellular ROS accumulation, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (&#x394;&#x3c8;m) and increased activation of caspases 3. These changes suggested lipotoxicity due to excessive PA. In addition, PA was observed to impair autophagic flux in NRCMs and impaired autophagosome clearance induced by PA contributes to cardiomyocyte death. Besides, we found that gCTRP9 increased the ratio of LC3II/I and the expression of ATG5 which was vital to the formation of autophagosomes and decreased the level of P62, suggesting enhanced autophagic flux in the absence or presence of PA. The result was further confirmed by the methods of infection with LC3-mRFP-GFP lentivirus and blockage of autophagosome-lysosome fusion by BafA1. Moreover, gCTRP9 reestablished the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, suppressed ROS generation, and reduced PA -induced myocyte death. However, the protective effect of gCTRP9 on the cardiac lipotoxicity was partly abolished by blockade of autophagy by autophagy-related 5 (ATG5) siRNA, indicating that the effect of gCTRP9 on cell survival is critically mediated through regulation of autophagy. Autophagy induction by gCTRP9 could be utilized as a potential therapeutic strategy against oxidative stress-mediated damage in cardiomyocytes.",

    "title": "Fat-On-A-Chip Models for Research and Discovery in Obesity and Its Metabolic Comorbidities.",
    "abstract": "The obesity epidemic and its associated comorbidities present a looming challenge to health care delivery throughout the world. Obesity is characterized as a sterile inflammatory process within adipose tissues leading to dysregulated secretion of bioactive adipokines such as adiponectin and leptin, as well as systemic metabolic dysfunction. The majority of current obesity research has focused primarily on preclinical animal models in vivo and two-dimensional cell culture models in vitro. Neither of these generalized approaches is optimal due to interspecies variability, insufficient accuracy with respect to predicting human outcomes, and failure to recapitulate the three-dimensional (3D) microenvironment. Consequently, there is a growing demand and need for more sophisticated microphysiological systems to reproduce more physiologically accurate human white and brown/beige adipose depots. To address this research need, human and murine cell lines and primary cultures are being combined with bioscaffolds to create functional 3D environments that are suitable for metabolically active adipose organoids in both static and perfusion bioreactor cultures. The development of these technologies will have considerable impact on the future pace of discovery for novel small molecules and biologics designed to prevent and treat metabolic syndrome and obesity in humans. Furthermore, when these adipose tissue models are integrated with other organ systems they will have applicability to obesity-related disorders such as diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and osteoarthritis. Impact statement The current review article summarizes the advances made within the organ-onchip field, as it pertains to adipose tissue models of obesity and obesity-related syndromes, such as diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and osteoarthritis. As humanized 3D adipose-derived constructs become more accessible to the research community, it is anticipated that they will accelerate and enhance the drug discovery pipeline for obesity, diabetes, and metabolic diseases by reducing the preclinical evaluation process and improving predictive accuracy. Such developments, applications, and usages of existing technologies can change the paradigm of personalized medicine and create substantial progress in our approach to modern medicine.",

    "title": "Visfatin/eNampt induces endothelial dysfunction in vivo: a role for Toll-Like Receptor 4 and NLRP3 inflammasome.",
    "abstract": "Visfatin/extracellular-nicotinamide-phosphoribosyltranferase-(eNampt) is a multifaceted adipokine enhanced in type-2-diabetes and obesity. Visfatin/eNampt cause in vitro endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation, although whether the same effects are achieved in vivo is unknown. Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4), a main surface pattern recognition receptor of innate immune system is a potential target for visfatin/eNampt. We studied its capacity to generate vascular dysfunction in vivo, focusing on TLR4 role and downstream activation of nod-like-receptor-protein-3 (NLRP3)-inflammasome. 4 month-old C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 7 days infusion of visfatin/eNampt, alone or together with FK 866 (Nampt enzymatic inhibitor), CLI 095 (TLR4 blocker), MCC 950 (NLRP3-inflammasome inhibitor), or anakinra (interleukin(IL)-1-receptor antagonist). Endothelial dysfunction was tested in isolated microvessels. In human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVEC), proteins related to the NLRP3-inflammasome phosphorylated p-65, NLRP3, caspase-1, pro-IL-1&#x3b2;, and mature IL-1&#x3b2; were determined by Western blot, while the inflammasome related apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC-specks) was studied by immunofluorescence. Impaired endothelium-dependent relaxations were observed in isolated mesenteric microvessels from visfatin/eNampt-infused mice. This effect was attenuated by co-treatment with FK 866 or CLI 095, supporting a role for Nampt enzymatic activity and TLR4 activation. Moreover, cultured HUVEC exposed to visfatin/eNampt showed higher expression and activation of NLRP3-inflammasome. Again, this effect relied on Nampt enzymatic activity and TLR4 activation, and it was abrogated by the inflammasome assembly blockade with MCC 950. The endothelial dysfunction evoked by visfatin/eNampt infusion in vivo was also sensitive to both MCC 950 and anakinra treatments, suggesting that the NLRP3-inflammasome-driven tissular release of IL-1&#x3b2; is the final mediator of endothelial damage. We conclude that Visfatin/eNampt produces in vivo vascular dysfunction in mice by a Nampt-dependent TLR4-mediated pathway, involving NLRP3-inflammasome and paracrine IL-1&#x3b2;. Thus, those targets may become therapeutic strategies for attenuating the adipokine-mediated vascular dysfunction associated to obesity and/or type-2-diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x3b3; (PPAR&#x3b3;), the molecular target for antidiabetic thiazolidinediones (TZDs), is a master regulator of preadipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism. The adverse side effects of TZDs, arising from their potent agonistic activity, can be minimized by PPAR&#x3b3; partial agonists or PPAR&#x3b3; non-agonists without loss of insulin sensitization. In this study, we reported that WSF-7, a synthetic chemical derived from natural monoterpene &#x3b1;-pinene, is a partial PPAR&#x3b3; agonist. We found that WSF-7 binds directly to PPAR&#x3b3;. Activation of PPAR&#x3b3; by WSF-7 promotes adipogenesis, adiponectin oligomerization and insulin-induced glucose uptake. WSF-7 also inhibits obesity-mediated PPAR&#x3b3; phosphorylation at serine (Ser)273 and improves insulin sensitivity of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Our study suggested that WSF-7 activates PPAR&#x3b3; transcription by a mechanism different from that of rosiglitazone or luteolin. Therefore, WSF-7 might be a potential therapeutic drug to treat type 2 diabetes.",

    "title": "Reduced circulating levels of chemokine CXCL14 in adolescent girls with polycystic ovary syndrome: normalization after insulin sensitization.",
    "abstract": "CXCL14 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand-14) is a chemokine released by active brown fat, showing protective effects against insulin resistance in experimental models. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in adolescent girls is usually related to hepato-visceral fat excess and insulin resistance, and associates with comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes. Treatment with a low-dose combination of one antiandrogen and antimineralocorticoid drug (spironolactone) and two insulin sensitizers (pioglitazone/metformin) (SPIOMET) is particularly effective in improving these metabolic derangements. Adipose tissue may be involved in the metabolic alterations of PCOS, and it is a likely target of therapeutic action. We investigated the alterations in CXCL14 levels and the effects of drugs composing SPIOMET treatment on CXCL14 in human adipocytes. We studied 51 adolescent patients with PCOS and 21 age-matched healthy controls. Thirty-one adolescent patients with PCOS under SPIOMET or oral contraception-based treatment were also studied. For studies in vitro, Simpson Golabi Behmel Syndrome (SGBS) adipose cells were used. Gene expression for CXCL14 and other genes was quantified using quantitative real-time PCR. The levels of CXCL14 and adipokines in serum and cell culture media were determined by ELISA. Serum CXCL14 levels are reduced in patients with PCOS. One-year SPIOMET treatment normalized CXCL14 concentrations and improved the metabolic status of patients with PCOS. Pioglitazone induced CXCL14 expression in differentiating human SGBS adipocytes, in parallel with the induction of marker genes of brown adipogenesis. Spironolactone induced CXCL14 expression and release in differentiated human adipocytes. Insulin sensitization with SPIOMET normalizes the abnormally low levels of CXCL14 in girls with PCOS. This is consistent with the effects of pioglitazone and spironolactone inducing CXCL14 expression and promoting a brown-like phenotype in adipocytes. CXCL14 may be a novel biomarker for PCOS as well as a potential mediator of the beneficial effects of the SPIOMET combination and may hold promise as a therapeutic modulator of the disorder.

    "title": "Multifaceted Physiological Roles of Adiponectin in Inflammation and Diseases.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin is the richest adipokine in human plasma, and it is mainly secreted from white adipose tissue. Adiponectin circulates in blood as high-molecular, middle-molecular, and low-molecular weight isoforms. Numerous studies have demonstrated its insulin-sensitizing, anti-atherogenic, and anti-inflammatory effects. Additionally, decreased serum levels of adiponectin is associated with chronic inflammation of metabolic disorders including Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and atherosclerosis. However, recent studies showed that adiponectin could have pro-inflammatory roles in patients with autoimmune diseases. In particular, its high serum level was positively associated with inflammation severity and pathological progression in rheumatoid arthritis, chronic kidney disease, and inflammatory bowel disease. Thus, adiponectin seems to have both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects. This indirectly indicates that adiponectin has different physiological roles according to an isoform and effector tissue. Knowledge on the specific functions of isoforms would help develop potential anti-inflammatory therapeutics to target specific adiponectin isoforms against metabolic disorders and autoimmune diseases. This review summarizes the current roles of adiponectin in metabolic disorders and autoimmune diseases.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived cytokine having an insulin-sensitizing activity. During the phenotypic screening of secondary metabolites derived from the marine fungus Aspergillusterreus, a poly cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor butyrolactone I affecting CDK1 and CDK5 was discovered as a potent adiponectin production-enhancing compound in the adipogenesis model of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs). CDK5 inhibitors exhibit insulin-sensitizing activities by suppressing the phosphorylation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x3b3; (PPAR&#x3b3;). However, the adiponectin production-enhancing activities of butyrolactone I have not been correlated with the potency of CDK5 inhibitor activities. In a target identification study, butyrolactone I was found to directly bind to PPAR&#x3b3;. In the crystal structure of the human PPAR&#x3b3;, the ligand-binding domain (LBD) in complex with butyrolactone I interacted with the amino acid residues located in the hydrophobic binding pockets of the PPAR&#x3b3; LBD, which is a typical binding mode of the PPAR&#x3b3; partial agonists. Therefore, the adiponectin production-enhancing effect of butyrolactone I was mediated by its polypharmacological dual modulator activities as both a CDK5 inhibitor and a PPAR&#x3b3; partial agonist.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the inhibitory effect of arctigenin, a novel anti-inflammatory lignan, on prostate cancer in obese conditions both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro obese models were established by co-culture of mouse adipocytes 3T3-L1 with androgen-sensitive LNCaP human prostate cancer cells, or by culturing LNCaP cells in adipocytes-conditioned medium. Arctigenin significantly inhibited LNCaP proliferation, along with decreased androgen receptor (AR) and increased Nkx3.1 cellular expression. Male severe combined immunodeficiency mice were subcutaneously implanted with human prostate cancer LAPC-4 xenograft tumors for in vivo study. Mice were fed high-fat (HF) diet and orally given arctigenin at 50&#x2009;mg/kg body weight daily or vehicle control for 6 weeks. Tumor bearing HF control mice showed a significant increase in serum free fatty acids (FFAs) and decrease in subcutaneous/peritoneal fat depots compared to non-tumor bearing control mice. Arctigenin intervention significantly reduced tumor growth by 45%, associated with decreased circulating FFAs and adipokines/cytokines including IGF-1, VEGF, and MCP-1, along with decreased AR, Ki67, and microvessel density and increased Nkx3.1 expression in tumors. These results indicate the strong ability of arctigenin to co-target obesity and tumor itself in inhibition of prostate tumor growth at a lower concentration compared to most phytochemicals.",

    "title": "Adiponectin inhibits the differentiation and maturation of osteoclasts via the mTOR pathway in multiple myeloma.",
    "abstract": "The present study sought to investigate the correlation between adipose cytokines (visfatin, leptin and adiponectin) and markers of multiple myeloma bone disease, and to determine the effects and mechanism of action of adiponectin on the differentiation and maturation of osteoclasts in multiple myeloma (MM). The levels of visfatin, leptin and adiponectin were measured. Their association with the indices of myeloma tumor load and bone disease were analyzed. Reverse transcription&#x2011;quantitative PCR was used to detect the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor&#x2011;&#x3ba;B ligand (RANKL), osteoclast associated Ig&#x2011;like receptor (OSCAR), tartrate&#x2011;resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and Cathepsin&#xa0;K genes. Flow cytometry was used to detect the expression of adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) and the phosphorylation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR) pathway&#x2011;associated proteins mTOR and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E&#x2011;binding protein (4EBP1). There were no significant correlations among leptin, visfatin and the indexes of myeloma tumor load and bone disease. Serum adiponectin levels were significantly lower in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma compared with healthy volunteers (12.37&#xb1;3.13 vs. 13.80&#xb1;0.95; P&lt;0.05). The number of mature osteoclasts in the adiponectin group was lower compared with in the control group. Adiponectin also inhibited the mRNA expression of the osteoclast&#x2011;associated factors RANKL, OSCAR, TRAP and Cathepsin K. Comparison between the non&#x2011;adiponectin group and the adiponectin group revealed that adiponectin increased the expression of AdipoR1 on the surface of osteoclast precursor cells (26.21&#xb1;4.27% vs. 29.86&#xb1;6.23%; P&lt;0.05) and reduced the expression of phosphorylated (p&#x2011;)mTOR (7.89&#xb1;1.00% vs. 5.91&#xb1;1.26%; P&lt;0.05) and p&#x2011;4EBP1 (26.78&#xb1;5.00% vs. 22.49&#xb1;4.24%; P&lt;0.05). The p&#x2011;mTOR and p&#x2011;4EBP1 levels in the adiponectin + MHY1485 (an mTOR signaling pathway&#x2011;specific agonist) group were significantly higher compared with those in the adiponectin group. It was revealed that adiponectin may inhibit osteoclast differentiation and maturation via the mTOR pathway. In conclusion, adiponectin inhibits the differentiation and maturation of osteoclasts by increasing the expression of AdipoR1 and reducing the phosphorylation levels of mTOR and 4EBP1 in patients with MM.",

    "title": "Postnatal leptin surge is critical for the transient induction of the developmental beige adipocytes in mice.",
    "abstract": "Beige adipocytes have become a promising therapeutic target to combat obesity. Our senior author Dr. B. Xue previously discovered a transient but significant induction of beige adipocytes in mice during early postnatal development, which peaked at postnatal day (P) 20 and then disappeared thereafter. However, the physiological mechanism underlying the transient induction of the developmental beige cells remains mystery. Interestingly, there exists a postnatal surge of leptin in mice at P10 before the appearance of the developmental beige adipocytes. Given the neurotropic effect of leptin during neuronal development and its role in activating the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), we tested the hypothesis that postnatal leptin surge is required for the transient induction of developmental beige adipocytes through sympathetic innervation. Unlike wild-type (WT) mice that were able to acquire the developmentally induced beige adipocytes at P20, ob/ob mice had much less uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-positive multilocular cells in inguinal white adipose tissue at the same age. This was consistent with reduced expression of UCP1 mRNA and protein levels in white fat of ob/ob mice. In contrast, daily injection of ob/ob mice with leptin between P8 and P16, mimicking the postnatal leptin surge, largely rescued the ability of these mice to acquire the developmentally induced beige adipocytes at P20, which was associated with enhanced sympathetic nerve innervation assessed by whole mount adipose tissue immunostaining of tyrosine hydroxylase. Our data demonstrate that the postnatal leptin surge is essential for the developmentally induced beige adipocyte formation in mice, possibly through increasing sympathetic nerve innervation.",

    "abstract": "Neuroprotective effects of leptin have been shown in mouse model of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury and primary cortical neuronal culture with oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), while the underlying mechanisms are less understood. In the present study, we investigated whether leptin modulated mitochondrial function through JAK2/STAT3 in vivo mouse model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and in OGD-challenged primary neuronal cultures. JAK2/STAT3; mitochondrial biogenesis markers (PGC-1&#x3b1;); and apoptosis-associated proteins (caspase-3, BCL-2, BCL-XL, and cytochrome c) were detected by western blotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction at 1&#x2009;h before and after ischemia/reperfusion. P-STAT3 and PGC-1&#x3b1; in neurons and astrocytes were detected. Moreover, mitochondrial morphology of the ischemic ipsilateral penumbra is examined using transmission electron microscopy. Primary cerebral cortical neurons were evaluated for viability, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and apoptosis to assess whether dose-dependent neuroprotective effects of leptin during OGD were mitigated by the JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor AG490. Leptin activated JAK2/STAT3 signaling in neurons and astrocytes distributed in the ischemic ipsilateral penumbra, with peak p-STAT3 levels observed at 1&#x2009;h after reperfusion. Leptin increased PGC-1&#x3b1;, BCL-2, and BCL-XL protein levels, cell viability, and MMP and decreased apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo; these effects were reversed by AG490 treatment. Our findings suggest that leptin-mediated neuroprotective effects in tMCAO may peak at 1&#x2009;h to induce the transcription of its target gene PGC-1&#x3b1;, stabilization of MMP, inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, release of cytochrome c, and apoptosis.",

    "title": "Systemic and brain delivery of leptin via intranasal coadministration with cell-penetrating peptides and its therapeutic potential for obesity.",
    "abstract": "Leptin is an endogenous hormone that regulates the appetite, energy metabolism, and glucose intake in the central nervous system (CNS) and is a potential therapeutic agent for obesity. In the normal healthy condition, peripherally secreted leptin is transported across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to the target brain site, in particular the hypothalamus. However, it was reported that the progression of obesity causes diminished permeation of leptin across the BBB. The present study therefore aimed to effectively deliver leptin to the brain via intranasal coadministration with penetratin, an amphipathic cell-penetrating peptide (CPP), for potential treatment and prevention of obesity. The single administration study with normal rats demonstrated that leptin coadministered with L-penetratin was efficiently absorbed into the systemic circulation and accumulated in the anterior part of brain. Furthermore, chronic delivery of leptin via repeated intranasal coadministrations with L-penetratin suppressed the appetite and the body weight increase of the rats and lowered their plasma triglyceride levels. Analysis of brain samples after repeated administration suggested that Stat3 phosphorylation via leptin receptor stimulation potentially contributed to the therapeutic effect of leptin in the CNS. Thus, the present study suggests that intranasal coadministration with CPPs will become a promising strategy for delivering leptin to treat and prevent the progression of obesity.",

    "abstract": "Cartilage calcification contributes to the development and progression of osteoarthritis (OA). It has been well-investigated adiponectin regulates vascular calcification. The purpose of this study is to investigate the therapeutic value and the molecular mechanism of AdipoRon, an adiponectin receptor agonist, on the chondrocytes calcification. Primary chondrocytes were isolated and cultured from normal cartilage and OA cartilage. The calcification in tissues was evaluated by inductively coupled plasma/atomic emission spectroscopy and alizarin red S staining. The calcification in chondrocytes was determined using the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining and an ALP assay kit. The cellular effects of AdipoRon were assessed by immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analysis. We found that calcification was significantly increased in OA cartilage tissues and cells. Importantly, the degree of calcification and ALP activity of the OA chondrocytes was decreased upon the treatment with AdipoRon. The AdipoRon-induced cellular effects, including the reduction of the calcification of chondrocytes and improvement of autophagy, were blocked by dorsomorphin, an 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor. Moreover, autophagy activation by AdipoRon was mediated by the AMPK-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Our results suggest that AdipoRon significantly alleviates the calcification of OA chondrocytes via activating AMPK-mTOR signaling to promote autophagy. Therefore, AdipoRon could be a potential therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of OA.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is often linked to metabolic syndrome, which assembles various risk factors related to obesity. Plasma levels of adiponectin are decreased in T2D and obese subjects. Aiming to develop a peptide able to bind adiponectin receptors and modulate their signalling pathways, a 12-amino acid sequence homologous in AdipoR1/R2 has been targeted by phage display with a linear 12-mer peptide library. The selected peptide P17 recognises AdipoR1/R2 expressed by skeletal muscle, liver and pancreatic islets. In HepaRG and C2C12 cells, P17 induced the activation of AMPK (AMPK&#x3b1;-pT172) and the expression of succinate dehydrogenase and glucokinase; no cytotoxic effects were observed on HepaRG cells. In db/db mice, P17 promoted body weight and glycaemia stabilisation, decreased plasma triglycerides to the range of healthy mice and increased adiponectin (in high fat-fed mice) and insulin (in chow-fed mice) levels. It restored to the range of healthy mice the tissue levels and subcellular distribution of AdipoR1/R2, AMPK&#x3b1;-pT172 and PPAR&#x3b1;-pS12. In liver, P17 reduced steatosis and apoptosis. The docking of P17 to AdipoR is reminiscent of the binding mechanism of adiponectin. To conclude, we have developed an AdipoR1/AdipoR2-targeted peptide that modulates adiponectin signalling pathways and has therapeutic relevance for T2D and obesity associated pathologies.",

    "title": "Is Leptin Resistance Another Key Resistance to Manage Type 2 Diabetes?",
    "abstract": "Although novel pharmacological options for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) have been observed to modulate the functionality of several key organs in glucose homeostasis, successful regulation of insulin resistance (IR), body weight management, and pharmacological treatment of obesity remain notable problems in endocrinology. Leptin may be a pivotal player in this scenario, as an adipokine which centrally regulates appetite and energy balance. In obesity, excessive caloric intake promotes a low-grade inflammatory response, which leads to dysregulations in lipid storage and adipokine secretion. In turn, these entail alterations in leptin sensitivity, leptin transport across the blood-brain barrier and defects in post-receptor signaling. Furthermore, hypothalamic inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress may increase the expression of molecules which may disrupt leptin signaling. Abundant evidence has linked obesity and leptin resistance, which may precede or occur simultaneously to IR and DM2. Thus, leptin sensitivity may be a potential early therapeutic target that demands further preclinical and clinical research. Modulators of insulin sensitivity have been tested in animal models and small clinical trials with promising results, especially in combination with agents such as amylin and GLP-1 analogs, in particular, due to their central activity in the hypothalamus.",

    "abstract": "The BMP2/4 antagonist and novel adipokine Gremlin 1 is highly expressed in human adipose cells and increased in hypertrophic obesity. As a secreted antagonist, it inhibits the effect of BMP2/4 on adipose precursor cell commitment/differentiation. We examined mRNA levels of Gremlin 1 in key target tissues for insulin and also measured tissue and serum levels in several carefully phenotyped human cohorts. Gremlin 1 expression was high in adipose tissue, higher in visceral than in subcutaneous tissue, increased in obesity, and further increased in type 2 diabetes (T2D). A similar high expression was seen in liver biopsies, but expression was considerably lower in skeletal muscles. Serum levels were increased in obesity but most prominently in T2D. Transcriptional activation in both adipose tissue and liver as well as serum levels were strongly associated with markers of insulin resistance in vivo (euglycemic clamps and HOMA of insulin resistance), and the presence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We also found Gremlin 1 to antagonize insulin signaling and action in human primary adipocytes, skeletal muscle, and liver cells. Thus, Gremlin 1 is a novel secreted insulin antagonist and biomarker as well as a potential therapeutic target in obesity and its complications T2D and NAFLD/NASH.",

    "abstract": "The metabolic syndrome has been associated with an alteration of intestinal microbiota, which can be considered as a target for the management of these patients. Phenolic extracts from Hibiscus sabdariffa have shown beneficial effects on obesity and its related complications. However, their effects on gut microbiota have not been investigated yet. This study evaluates the effects of a chemically characterized polyphenolic extract of H. sabdariffa (HSE) in an experimental model of diet-induced obesity (DIO) in mice. HSE was administered daily by oral gave for 42&#x202f;days. HSE reduced weight increase in high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice, and improved glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and normalized LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio. It also enhanced the inflammatory state in the liver, reducing the expression of different adipokines and proinflammatory mediators, and reinforced gut integrity by increasing the expression of mucins and proteins involved in the maintenance of mucosal barrier. Moreover, HSE had a prebiotic effect, ameliorating the changes in the gut microbiota induced by the HFD. Thus, HSE improved the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, which may contribute to the beneficial effects. Consequently, HSE could be considered for the development of a complementary treatment for the metabolic syndrome due to its beneficial properties.",

    "title": "Prediction and Structural Comparison of Deleterious Coding Nonsynonymous Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in Human LEP Gene Associated with Obesity.",
    "abstract": "Leptin is a peptide hormone that regulates fat stores in the body and appetite by controlling the feeling of satiety. This hormone is secreted by the white adipose tissue and plays a role in the storage and mobilization of fatty acids. Mutations of the LEP gene have been associated with obesity in different populations; it is a multifactorial disease that constitutes a major public health problem. In this study, we evaluated the impact of missense SNPs in the LEP gene extracted from dbSNP using 8 computational prediction tools. Out of the total of 4337 SNPs, 93 were nsSNPs (nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms). Among 93 nsSNPs, 12 (S46L, G59S, D61N, D100N, N103K, C117S, D76V, S88C, P90R, I95N, L161R, and R105W) variants were predicted to be the most deleterious by prediction software. On these 12 deleterious SNPs, 8 variants (S46L, G59S, D61N, D100N, N103K, C117S, L161R, and R105W) were located in the conserved positions and showed a decrease in structure stability which was evaluated by I-Mutant and Mupro. Then, by analyzing the different interactions between different amino acids in wild and mutated proteins, we assessed the structural impact of the deleterious modifications using the YASARA software. Among 8 deleterious nsSNPs, we revealed structure changes in the 6 variants S46L, G59S, D100N, L103K, R105W, L161R, two of which R105W, N103K were previously reported as associated with obesity. Our study suggests 6 deleterious mutations could play an important role in contributing to human obesity and worth to be included in association and functional studies, then may be a drug target.",

    "title": "Acid sphingomyelinase downregulation alleviates vascular endothelial leptin resistance in rats.",
    "abstract": "Leptin resistance in endothelial cells leads to vascular endothelial dysfunction, which is the beginning and crucial link of atherosclerosis. However, the mechanism of leptin resistance remains obscure. Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) catalyzes the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to produce ceramide, which plays an important role in the progression of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we investigated whether ASM could regulate leptin resistance in vascular endothelial cells. We induced endothelial leptin resistance in rat aortic endothelial cells through treatment with palmitic acid (0.3&#x2009;mM) or knockdown of leptin receptor (Ob-Rb), which resulted in the increase of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 expression, the decrease of Ob-Rb expression, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation at Tyr705. We found that these indicators of leptin resistance were reversed by knockdown of ASM or by the selective ASM inhibitors amitriptyline (AMI) and imipramine (IMI). Supplementation of ceramide inhibited Ob-Rb expression and STAT3 phosphorylation by inhibiting extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of ASM enhanced endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase activity and NO production, as well as the Akt phosphorylation at ser473, which was regulated by STAT3. High-fat diet (HFD) feeding-induced leptin resistance in rats in vivo; administration of AMI and IMI (10&#x2009;mg&#xb7;&#x2009;kg<sup>-1</sup> per day, intraperitoneally, for 2 weeks) increased the release of endothelial NO to relieve the vasodilatory response and improved the endothelial leptin resistance in the aorta of HFD-fed rats. These results suggest that ASM downregulation reverses endothelial leptin resistance, and consequently improves vascular endothelial dysfunction. This study highlighted ASM as a potential therapeutic target for endothelial leptin resistance.",

    "abstract": "The present study was to illustrate the agonistic property of arjungenin and arjunic acid towards farnesoid X receptor protein (FXR).The pharmacokinetic properties like molecular interactions, absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination and toxicity (ADMET) of the ligands were checked through in-silico studies. Protein-ligand docking was carried out using autodock software. Molecular docking analysis confirmed strong binding energy and interaction of arjungenin and arjunic acid with the target protein and the ADMET profiles identified for both compounds were promising.Further in vitro studies were performed in 3T3-L1 adipocyte to verify the agonistic property of arjungenin and arjunic acid. Oil red O staining was done to check differentiation induction. Adiponectin, leptin, triglycerides and total cholesterol levels were quantified. The mRNA expression of FXR, Cyp7a1, PPAR-&#x3b3; and SREBP-1c were quantified using fluorescent real-time PCR. Cytotoxicity assay was confirmed that up to 150 &#x3bc;M concentration there is no significant cell death on treatment with arjunic acid and arjungenin. Treatment with arjungenin and arjunic acid confirms increased differentiation of the cells with significant (P&#x202f;&lt;&#x202f;0.05) increase in adiponectin (118.07% and 132.92%) and leptin (133.52% and 149.74%) protein levels compared to the negative control group. After treatment with arjungenin and arjunic acid in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes the mRNA expression of FXR, PPAR-&#x3b3; and SREBP-1c were significantly (P&#x202f;&lt;&#x202f;0.01) increased and cyp7a1 was significantly (P&#x202f;&lt;&#x202f;0.01) decreased when compared with the negative control group. Overall, our results suggest that arjungenin and arjunic acid acts as an FXR agonist and may be useful for rational therapeutic strategies as a novel drug to treat cholesterol mediated metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance.",

    "abstract": "Obesity, a recognized risk factor for breast cancer in postmenopausal women, is associated with higher mortality rates regardless of menopausal status, which could in part be explained by therapeutic escape. Indeed, adipose microenvironment has been described to influence the efficiency of chemo- and hormonal therapies. Residual cancer stem cells could also have a key role in this process. To understand the mechanisms involved in the reduced efficacy of hormonal therapy on breast cancer cells in the presence of adipose secretome, human adipose stem cells (hMAD cell line) differentiated into mature adipocytes were co-cultured with mammary breast cancer cells and treated with hormonal therapies (tamoxifen, fulvestrant). Proliferation and apoptosis were measured (fluorescence test, impedancemetry, cytometry) and the gene expression profile was evaluated. Cancer stem cells were isolated from mammospheres made from MCF-7. The impact of chemo- and hormonal therapies and leptin was evaluated in this population. hMAD-differentiated mature adipocytes and their secretions were able to increase mammary cancer cell proliferation and to suppress the antiproliferative effect of tamoxifen, confirming previous data and validating our model. Apoptosis and cell cycle did not seem to be involved in this process. The evaluation of gene expression profiles suggested that STAT3 could be a possible target. On the contrary, leptin did not seem to be involved. The study of isolated cancer stem cells revealed that their proliferation was stimulated in the presence of anticancer therapies (tamoxifen, fulvestrant, doxorubicine) and leptin. Our study confirmed the role of adipocytes and their secretome, but above all, the role of communication between adipose and cancer cells in interfering with the efficiency of hormonal therapy. Among the pathophysiological mechanisms involved, leptin does not seem to interfere with the estrogenic pathway but seems to promote the proliferation of cancer stem cells.",

    "title": "Resistin enhances angiogenesis in osteosarcoma via the MAPK signaling pathway.",
    "abstract": "Over the last two decades, there have been no significant changes in patient outcomes in relation to the treatment of osteosarcoma, an aggressive malignant neoplasm. It is known that vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) plays a crucial role in angiogenesis and in osteosarcoma. Moreover, VEGF-A expression correlates with clinical stages of osteosarcoma. The adipokine resistin exhibits proinflammatory, proangiogenic and metastatic properties, and evidence suggests that resistin may serve as a prognostic biomarker linking obesity and inflammation to cancer. However, whether resistin has a role in osteosarcoma angiogenesis is unclear. This investigation shows that resistin promotes VEGF-A expression in human osteosarcoma cells and activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 signaling pathways, while ERK, JNK, and p38 inhibitors or their small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) inhibit resistin-induced VEGF-A expression as well as endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) migration and tube formation. We also found that resistin upregulates VEGF-A expression by enhancing activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-&#x3ba;B). Finally, resistin promotes angiogenesis in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model. Resistin appears to be a promising target for human osteosarcoma.",

    "abstract": "Bisphenol A (BPA) is a plasticizer with endocrine disrupting properties particularly relevant for children health. Recently BPA has been associated with metabolic dysfunctions but no data are yet available in specific, long-term studies. This study aimed to evaluate BPA modes of action and hazards during animal juvenile life-stage, corresponding to childhood. Immature Sprague-Dawley rats of both sexes were orally treated with 0 (vehicle only-olive oil), 2, 6, and 18 mg/kg bw per day of BPA for 28 days, from weaning to sexual maturity. Dose levels were obtained from the PERSUADED biomonitoring study in Italian children. Both no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL)/low-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL) and estimated benchmark dose (BMD) approaches were applied. General toxicity, parameters of sexual development, endocrine/reproductive/functional liver and kidney biomarkers, histopathology of target tissues, and gene expression in hypothalamic-pituitary area and liver were studied. No mortality or general toxicity occurred. Sex-specific alterations were observed in liver, thyroid, spleen, leptin/adiponectin serum levels, and hypothalamic-pituitary gene expression. Thyroid homeostasis and liver were the most sensitive targets of BPA exposure in the peripubertal phase. The proposed LOAEL was 2 mg/kg bw, considering as critical effect the liver endpoints, kidney weight in male and adrenal histomorphometrical alterations and osteopontin upregulation in female rats. The BMD lower bounds were 0.05 and 1.33 mg/kg bw in males and females, considering liver and thyroid biomarkers, respectively. Overall, BPA evaluation at dose levels derived from children biomonitoring study allowed to identify sex-specific, targeted toxicological effects that may have significant impact on risk assessment for children.",

    "abstract": "Excess fat deposition could induce phenotypic changes of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT remodeling), which may promote the progression of atherosclerosis via modulation of adipocytokine secretion. However, it remains unclear whether and how suppression of PVAT remodeling could attenuate vascular injury. In this study, we examined the effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, luseogliflozin on PVAT remodeling and neointima formation after wire injury in mice. Wilt-type mice fed with low-fat diet (LFD) or high-fat diet (HFD) received oral administration of luseogliflozin (18&#xa0;mg/kg/day) or vehicle. Mice underwent bilateral femoral artery wire injury followed by unilateral removal of surrounding PVAT. After 25&#xa0;days, injured femoral arteries and surrounding PVAT were analyzed. In LFD-fed lean mice, neither luseogliflozin treatment or PVAT removal attenuated the intima-to-media (I/M) ratio of injured arteries. However, in HFD-fed mice, luseogliflozin or PVAT removal reduced the I/M ratio, whereas their combination showed no additive reduction. In PVAT surrounding injured femoral arteries of HFD-fed mice, luseogliflozin treatment decreased the adipocyte sizes. Furthermore, luseogliflozin reduced accumulation of macrophages expressing platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) and increased adiponectin gene expression. Gene expression levels of Pdgf-b in PVAT were correlated with the I/M ratio. Our present study suggests that luseogliflozin could attenuate neointimal hyperplasia after wire injury in HFD-fed mice partly via suppression of macrophage PDGF-B expression in PVAT. Inhibition of PVAT remodeling by luseogliflozin may be a novel therapeutic target for vascular remodeling after angioplasty.",

    "title": "AdipoRon: A Novel Insulin Sensitizer in Various Complications and the Underlying Mechanisms: A Review.",
    "abstract": "AdipoRon is the first synthetic analog of endogenous adiponectin, an adipose tissue-derived hormone. AdipoRon possesses pharmacological properties similar to adiponectin and its ability to bind and activate the adipoR1 and adipoR2 receptors makes it a suitable candidate for the treatment of a multitude of disorders. In the present review, an attempt was made to compile and discuss the efficacy of adipoRon against various disorders. AdipoRon is a drug that acts not only in metabolic diseases but in other conditions unrelated to energy metabolism. It is well- reported that adipoRon exhibits strong anti-obesity, anti-diabetic, anticancer, anti-depressant, anti-ischemic, anti-hypertrophic properties and also improves conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and systemic sclerosis. A lot is known about its effects in experimental systems, but the translation of this knowledge to the clinic requires studies which, for many of the potential target conditions, have yet to be carried out. The beneficial effects of AdipoRon in novel clinical conditions will suggest an underlying pathophysiological role of adiponectin and its receptors in previously unsuspected settings.",

    "abstract": "Zinc-&#x3b1;2-glycoprotein 1 (AZGP1) plays important roles in metabolism-related diseases. The underlying molecular mechanisms and therapeutic effects of AZGP1 remain unknown in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). To explore the effects and potential mechanism of AZGP1 on NAFLD in vivo and in vitro. The expression of AZGP1 and its effects on hepatocytes were examined in NAFLD patients, CCl4-treated mice fed a high fat diet (HFD), and human LO2 cells. AZGP1 levels were significantly decreased in liver tissues of NAFLD patients and mice. AZGP1 knockdown was found to activate inflammation; enhance steatogenesis, including promoting lipogenesis [sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c, liver X receptor (LXR), fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD)-1], increasing lipid transport and accumulation [fatty acid transport protein (FATP), carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT)-1A, and adiponectin], and reducing fatty acid &#x3b2;-oxidation [farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-&#x3b1;]; accelerate proliferation; and reverse apoptosis in LO2 cells. AZGP1 overexpression (OV-AZGP1) had the opposite effects. Furthermore, AZGP1 alleviated NAFLD by blocking TNF-&#x3b1;-mediated inflammation and intracellular lipid deposition, promoting proliferation, and inhibiting apoptosis in LO2 cells. Finally, treatment with OV-AZGP1 plasmid dramatically improved liver injury and eliminated liver fat in NAFLD mice. AZGP1 attenuates NAFLD with regard to ameliorating inflammation, accelerating lipolysis, promoting proliferation, and reducing apoptosis by negatively regulating TNF-&#x3b1;. AZGP1 is suggested to be a novel promising therapeutic target for NAFLD.",

    "title": "Drugs That Ameliorate Epicardial Adipose Tissue Inflammation May Have Discordant Effects in Heart Failure With a Preserved Ejection Fraction as Compared With a Reduced Ejection Fraction.",
    "abstract": "Heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) have distinctive pathophysiologies, and thus, therapeutic approaches to the 2 disorders should differ. Neurohormonal activation drives the progression of HFrEF, and neurohormonal antagonists are highly effective in HFrEF, but not in HFpEF. Conversely, a broad range of chronic systemic inflammatory or metabolic disorders cause an expansion and inflammation of epicardial adipose tissue; the secretion of adipocytokines may lead to microvascular dysfunction and fibrosis of the underlying myocardium, which (if the left atrium is affected) may lead to atrial fibrillation (AF) and (if the left ventricle is affected) may lead to HFpEF. Anti-inflammatory drugs (such as statins and anticytokine agents) can ameliorate epicardial adipose tissue dysfunction. Statins appear to ameliorate the development of atrial myopathy (both experimentally and clinically), and in randomized controlled trials, they reduce the incidence of new-onset and recurrent AF and decrease the risk of heart failure with the features of HFpEF; yet, they have no benefits in HFrEF. Similarly, anticytokine agents appear to prevent heart failure in patients with or prone to HFpEF, but adversely affect HFrEF. Several antihyperglycemic agents also reduce epicardial fat mass and inflammation, but this benefit may be offset by additional actions to cause sodium retention and neurohormonal activation. Thiazolidinediones have favorable effects on experimental AF and HFpEF, but their antinatriuretic actions negate these benefits, and they worsen the clinical course of HFrEF. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists also ameliorate AF and HFpEF in laboratory models, but their positive inotropic and chronotropic effects may be deleterious in HFrEF. By contrast, metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors alleviate epicardial adipose tissue dysfunction and may reduce the risk of AF and HFpEF; yet, they may have additional actions to promote cardiomyocyte survival that are useful in HFrEF. The concordance of the benefits of anti-inflammatory and antihyperglycemic drugs on AF and HFpEF (but not on HFrEF) supports the paradigm that epicardial adipose tissue is a central pathogenetic mechanism and therapeutic target for both AF and HFpEF in patients with chronic systemic inflammatory or metabolic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Psoriasis is a chronic, systemic, hyper-proliferative immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease. The results of epidemiological investigations have shown that psoriasis affects around 2% of the general population worldwide, and the total number of psoriasis patients is more than 6 million in China. Apart from the skin manifestations, psoriasis has been verified to associate with several metabolic comorbidities, such as insulin resistance, diabetes and obesity. However, the underlying mechanism is still not elucidated. Adipocytes, considered as the active endocrine cells, are dysfunctional in obesity which displays increased synthesis and secretion of adipokines with other modified metabolic properties. Currently, growing evidence has pointed to the central role of adipokines in adipose tissue and the immune system, providing new insights into the effect of adipokines in linking the pathophysiology of obesity and psoriasis. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the pathological role of adipokines and the potential mechanisms whereby different adipokines link obesity and psoriasis. Furthermore, we also provide evidence which identifies a potential therapeutic target aiming at adipokines for the management of these two diseases.",

    "abstract": "YiQiFuMai Powder Injection (YQFM) is widely used in clinical practice for the treatment of heart failure (HF). However, its functional molecular mechanism remains to be fully uncovered. Our present study aimed to elucidate the impact of YQFM and underlying mechanisms on coronary artery ligation (CAL)-induced HF. Our results exhibited that YQFM significantly mitigated CAL-induced HF via meliorating the left ventricular contractile function and reducing the serum content of creatine kinase MB (CK-MB), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), interleukin-6 (IL-6), troponin (Tn), myosin, myoglobin (MYO) and myocilin (MYOC). Then, the relevance between circulating omentin level and cardiac function was investigated and we found that serum omentin levels positively associated with ejection fraction and negatively correlated with NT-proBNP content. Further, the effect of YQFM on cardiac function and omentin change in 1, 7 and 14 days CAL-induced HF mice was evaluated and the omentin secretion in isolated subcutaneous (SCAT) and epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) after YQFM treatment were detected. YQFM could increase the circulating omentin content both in 14 days CAL-induced HF mice and isolated EAT. And increased omentin in conditioned medium (CM) could inhibit simulated ischemic/reperfusion (SI/R)-induced cardiomyocytes apoptosis. Moreover, YQFM could ameliorate myocardial apoptosis via positive regulation of AMPK, PI3&#x202f;K/Akt and negative regulation of MAPKs signaling pathways. Ginsenoside Rd might partially mediated omentin-dependent protective effect of YQFM. Our findings indicated that regulation of cross-talk between adipose tissue and cardiomyocytes might be a potential target through which YQFM exerts cardioprotective effect apart from direct cardiomyocytes protection.",

    "title": "Immune and Inflammatory Cells in Thyroid Cancer Microenvironment.",
    "abstract": "A hallmark of cancer is the ability of tumor cells to avoid immune destruction. Activated immune cells in tumor microenvironment (TME) secrete proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines which foster the proliferation of tumor cells. Specific antigens expressed by cancer cells are recognized by the main actors of immune response that are involved in their elimination (immunosurveillance). By the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells, decreasing the tumor immunogenicity, or through other immunosuppressive mechanisms, tumors can impair the host immune cells within the TME and escape their surveillance. Within the TME, cells of the innate (e.g., macrophages, mast cells, neutrophils) and the adaptive (e.g., lymphocytes) immune responses are interconnected with epithelial cancer cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells via cytokines, chemokines, and adipocytokines. The molecular pattern of cytokines and chemokines has a key role and could explain the involvement of the immune system in tumor initiation and progression. Thyroid cancer-related inflammation is an important target for diagnostic procedures and novel therapeutic strategies. Anticancer immunotherapy, especially immune checkpoint inhibitors, unleashes the immune system and activates cytotoxic lymphocytes to kill cancer cells. A better knowledge of the molecular and immunological characteristics of TME will allow novel and more effective immunotherapeutic strategies in advanced thyroid cancer.",

    "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, is closely related to metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Despite an accumulating number of studies, no pharmacotherapy that targets NAFLD has received general approval for clinical use. Inhibition of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) is a promising approach to treat diabetes, obesity, and associated metabolic disorders. In this study, we investigated the effect of a novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, on NAFLD and obesity-associated metabolic symptoms in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. Delayed intervention with NGI001 protected against body weight gain, hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia, and hyperinsulinaemia, compared with HFD alone. Adipocyte hypertrophy was prevented by administering NGI001. NGI001 inhibited impaired glucose metabolism and regulated the secretion of adipokines associated with insulin resistance. In addition, NGI001 supplementation suppressed hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation but had little effect on kidney function. In-depth investigations showed that NGI001 ameliorated fat deposition and increased AMPK phosphorylation, resulting in phosphorylation of its major downstream target, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, in human hepatocyte HuS-E/2 cells. This cascade ultimately led to the down-regulation of downstream fatty acid synthesis-related molecules and the up-regulation of downstream &#x3b2; oxidation-associated molecules. Surprisingly, NGI001 decreased gene and protein expression of SGLT1 and SGLT2 and glucose uptake in oleic acid-treated HuS-E/2 cells. Our findings suggest the novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001 has therapeutic potential to attenuate or delay the onset of diet-induced metabolic diseases and NAFLD.",

    "abstract": "The survival of patients diagnosed with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is still limited and the current targeted therapies are only partially effective. Herein, we investigated the clinical value and functions of adiponectin receptors (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2) in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). A total of 127 mRCC patients treated with first-line TKIs between 2008 and 2017 at a single institution were collected. AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry. AdipoR1 was positively expressed in 87.4% (111/127) of tumors, especially, highly expressed in pulmonary and bone lesions. Patients with low-AdipoR1 expression in primary tumor tissues were more likely to suffer from progressive disease during TKIs treatment (40.0% vs. 11.1%, P&#x202f;=&#x202f;0 .02), and with decreased progression-free survival (PFS: 19.5 vs. 37.8 mo, P&#x202f;=&#x202f;.001) and overall survival (OS: 62.3 vs 101.1 mo, P&#x202f;=&#x202f;.004) compared to those with high-AdipoR1 expression. Moreover, low-AdipoR1 expression in metastatic tissues was also associated with poor PFS (P&#x202f;=&#x202f;.006) and OS (P&#x202f;=&#x202f;.037). In contrast, AdipoR2 expression was neither associated with sunitinib response nor patient survival. In vitro, we found that adiponectin inhibited migration, invasion and sensitized RCC cells to sunitinib though interacting with AdipoR1, but not AdipoR2. Furthermore, we demonstrated that adiponentin-AdipoR1 axis inhibits tumor cells migration and invasion by blocking the GSK3&#x3b2;/&#x3b2;-Catenin pathway and enhances sunitinib sensitivity via abrogating PI3K/AKT/NF-&#x3ba;B signaling. Our results suggest that adiponentin-AdipoR1 axis may serve as a predictor of TKIs response and could be a potential therapeutic target in the future treatment for metastatic RCC.",

The only means for management of ID is insulin therapy; yet, this approach is sub-optimal and causes life-threatening hypoglycemia. Hence, ID represents a great medical and societal challenge. Here we report that S100A9, also known as Calgranulin B or Myeloid-Related Protein 14 (MRP14), is a leptin-induced circulating cue exerting beneficial anti-diabetic action. In murine models of ID, enhanced expression of S100A9 alone (i.e. without administered insulin and/or leptin) slightly improves hyperglycemia, and normalizes key metabolic defects (e.g. hyperketonemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and increased hepatic fatty acid oxidation; FAO), and extends lifespan by at least a factor of two. Mechanistically, we report that Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) is required, at least in part, for the metabolic-improving and pro-survival effects of S100A9. Thus, our data identify the S100A9/TLR4 axis as a putative target for ID care.",

    "abstract": "The microenvironment of breast cancer comprises predominantly of adipocytes. Adipocytes drive cancer progression through the secretion adipocytokines. Adipocytes induce epithelial mesenchymal transition of breast cancer cells through paracrine IL-6/Stat3 signalling. Treatment approaches that can target adipocytes in the microenvironment and abrogate paracrine signals that drive breast cancer growth and metastasis are urgently needed. Repositioning of old drugs has become an effective approach for discovering new cancer drugs. In this study, niclosamide, an FDA approved anthelminthic drug was evaluated for its anti-breast cancer activity and its ability to inhibit adipocytes induced EMT. Niclosamide potently inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion at low concentration and induced significant apoptosis at high concentrations in human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7. Additionally, niclosamide reversed adipocyte-induced EMT with a correlated inhibition of IL-6/Stat3 activation and downregulation of EMT-TFs TWIST and SNAIL. Moreover, niclosamide markedly impaired MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 migration and invasion. We further found that the inhibitory effects of niclosamide on MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 motility was closely related to destabilization of focal adhesion complex formation. With decreased co-localization of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and phosphorylated paxillin (pPAX). Collectively, these results demonstrate that niclosamide could be used to inhibit adipocyte-induced breast cancer growth and metastasis.",

    "title": "Ascorbic acid attenuates cell stress by activating the&#xa0;fibroblast growth factor 21/fibroblast growth factor receptor&#xa0;2/adiponectin pathway in HepG2 cells.",
    "abstract": "Increasing prevalence of obesity&#x2011;induced non&#x2011;alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non&#x2011;alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has been reported. Ascorbic acid (AA), also known as vitamin C, an excellent antioxidant, has been shown to exert beneficial effects on NAFLD; however, the underlying mechanisms are yet to be fully elucidated. In the present study, the role of AA on cell stress in tumor necrosis factor &#x3b1; (TNF&#x3b1;)&#x2011;treated HepG2&#xa0;cells was investigated. Our findings revealed that exposure to AA effectively ameliorated TNF&#x3b1;&#x2011;induced cell stresses, including hypoxia, inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by reducing the expression of Hif1&#x3b1; and its target genes (glucose transporter 1), pro&#x2011;inflammatory genes (monocyte chemoattractant 1) and ER stress&#x2011;related genes (glucose&#x2011;regulated protein, 78&#xa0;kDa). AA also decreased the protein level of HIF1&#x3b1;. Additionally, AA significantly increased the secretion of total adiponectin and high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin. Mechanistically, AA was determined to increase the expression of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and its receptor, fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2). Knockdown of FGFR2 not only decreased the levels of total adiponectin and HMW adiponectin, but almost abolished the beneficial effects of AA in ameliorating cell stress. Collectively, the findings of our study demonstrated that AA may attenuate hepatocyte stress induced by TNF&#x3b1; via activation of the FGF21/FGFR2/adiponectin pathway. This could a novel mechanism of action of AA, and its potential for the treatment of NAFLD/NASH.",

    "title": "The host response to poly(lactide-co-glycolide) scaffolds protects mice from diet induced obesity and glucose intolerance.",
    "abstract": "Underlying metabolic disease is poor adipose tissue function characterized by impaired glucose tolerance and low expression of health promoting adipokines. Currently, no treatments specifically target the adipose tissue and we are investigating polymer scaffolds for localized drug delivery as a therapeutic platform. In this work we implanted porous poly(lactide-co-glycolide) scaffolds into the epididymal fat of mice. Surprisingly, empty scaffolds decreased blood glucose levels in healthy mice as well as epididymal fat pad size. By injecting a fluorescent glucose tracer into mice, we determined that glucose uptake increases by 60% in epididymal fat pads with scaffolds; in contrast, glucose uptake was not elevated in other major metabolic organs, suggesting the enhanced glucose uptake at the scaffold implant site was responsible for decreased blood glucose levels. Histology indicated increased cellularity and tissue remodeling around the scaffold and we found increased expression of glucose transporter 1 and insulin-like growth factor 1, which are proteins involved in wound healing that can also modulate blood glucose levels through their promotion of glucose uptake. Regarding clinical translation, empty scaffolds decreased obesity and improved glucose tolerance in mice fed a high fat diet. These findings demonstrate increased cellular activity in the adipose tissue, such as that associated with the host response to biomaterial implant, is beneficial in mice suffering from metabolic complications of over nutrition, possibly because it mitigates the positive energy balance that leads to the obese, diabetic state. More broadly, this work reaffirms that in addition to the local host response typically investigated, biomaterial implant has systemic physiological effects and suggests that there may be implications for therapy.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the study was to investigate the features of expression and adiponectin content in the adipocyte culture of subcutaneous, epicardial, and perivascular adipose tissue and the effect of various doses of rosuvastatin on these processes. 29 patients with coronary artery disease were examined. Adipocytes were isolated from the samples of SAT, EAT and PVAT which were taken during coronary artery bypass surgery, followed by cultivation in the presence of rosuvastatin and evaluation of gene expression and adiponectin concentration. Adipocytes SAT, EAT and PVAT differed in the level of adiponectin secretion and expression of its gene. On day 1 of cultivation the expression of the adiponectin gene in the EAT was 2.3 times lower than in the PVAT. On day 2 of cultivation the expression of the adiponectin gene was reduced both in the EAT and the PVAT as compared to the SAT. When rosuvastatin was added at a concentration of 1 mmol/L, adiponectin gene expression in PVAT was higher than when rosuvastatin was added at a concentration of 5 mmol/L, in the adipocyte culture of SAT effect was opposite. Thus, the adipocytes of EZhT and, to a greater extent, PAS, can be a therapeutic target for statins in the case of the pathological activation of adipose tissue.

    "abstract": "The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of the IgG and/or IgM isotypes of the antiphospholipid antibodies, thrombosis and/or recurrent pregnancy losses. Various markers of inflammation are associated with clinical and/or laboratory features of APS. Adiponectin (Ad) is a member of the adipocytokines that exert its roles by binding to its receptors (AdR). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonists induced Ad production. The aged Pparg null-mice represented the first animal model that spontaneously develops APS and this model emphasized the importance of PPAR-gamma signaling in the development of APS. Recombinant Ad (rAd) application was beneficial for the improvement of glucose, insulin and lipid levels in mice. Orally active AdR agonist exerted similar effects to Ad in mice. Due to the re-occurrence of thrombotic episodes in APS patients (despite life-long anticoagulation), administration of PPAR-gamma agonists, rAd, or AdR agonists should be further tested in experimental models of APS, which eventually, will provide more data for novel therapeutic strategies that will ameliorate clinical manifestations of the APS.",

    "title": "Increasing Adiponergic System Activity as a Potential Treatment for Depressive Disorders.",
    "abstract": "Depression is the most devastating mental disorder and one of the leading contributors to the global medical burden. Current antidepressant prescriptions present drawbacks, including treatment resistance, delayed onset of treatment response, and side effects. The rapid and long-lasting antidepressant effect of ketamine has brought hope to treatment-resistant major depressive disorder patients. However, ketamine has undesirable addictive properties and is a drug of abuse. There is an urgent need, therefore, to develop novel pharmacological interventions that could be as effective as ketamine, but without its side effects. Adiponectin, a pleiotropic adipocyte-secreted hormone, has insulin-sensitizing and neurotrophic properties. It can cross the blood-brain barrier and target multiple brain regions where the adiponectin receptors are detected. Emerging evidence has suggested that adiponectin and the adiponectin receptor agonist, AdipoRon, could promote adult neurogenesis, dendritic and spine remodeling, and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, resulting in antidepressant effects in adult mice. By summarizing the most recent clinical and animal studies, this review provides a timely insight on how modulating the adiponergic system in the hippocampus could be a potential therapeutic target for an effective and fast-acting antidepressant response.",

    "title": "A structure-function approach identifies L-PGDS as a mediator responsible for glucocorticoid-induced leptin expression in adipocytes.",
    "abstract": "Leptin is an adipokine predominantly secreted by adipocytes and has many physiological roles, including in energy homeostasis. We identified that AM630, a cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) antagonist, down-regulated leptin expression in mature adipocytes differentiated from either stromal vascular fractions isolated from inguinal fat pads of C57BL/6J mice or 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. However, the leptin-suppressive effects of AM630 preserved in CB2-deficient adipocytes indicated the off-target activity of AM630 in leptin expression. Pharmacological and genetic studies, cheminformatics, and docking simulation were applied to identify the potential protein target of AM630 that modulates leptin expression in differentiated primary preadipocytes. Screening of the reported off-targets of AM630 identified a synthetic cannabinoid WIN55212-2 exerting the same function. Target deconvolution and docking simulation suggested that AM630 and WIN55212-2 were both inhibitors of lipocalin-type prostaglandin D2 synthase (L-PGDS). Further studies showed that L-PGDS positively regulates leptin expression. Although glucocorticoid and aldosterone were previously reported to induce expression of both L-PGDS and leptin, our data demonstrated that L-PGDS mediates only glucocorticoid-induced leptin expression in differentiated primary preadipocytes. No effect was observed after aldosterone treatment. This newly discovered glucocorticoid - L-PGDS - leptin pathway may provide insights into current clinical use of glucocorticoid and management of their undesired effects such as obesity.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin concentrations are low in obese pregnant women. Restoring normal adiponectin concentrations by infusion in obese pregnant mice prevents placental dysfunction, foetal overgrowth and metabolic syndrome in the offspring. We hypothesised that normalising maternal adiponectin in obese late pregnant dams prevents cardiac dysfunction in the adult offspring. Pregnant female mice with diet-induced obesity were infused with adiponectin (0.62&#x2009;&#x3bc;g&#x2009;g<sup>-1</sup>&#x2009;day<sup>-1</sup>, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;24) or saline (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;22) over days 14.5-18.5 of pregnancy (term&#x2009;=&#x2009;day 19.5). Control dams ate standard chow and received saline (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;22). Offspring were studied at 3 and 6 months of age. Maternal obesity impaired ventricular diastolic function, increased cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area and upregulated cardiac brain natriuretic peptide (Nppb) and &#x3b1;-skeletal actin (Acta1) gene expression in adult male offspring, compared to control offspring. In adult female offspring, maternal obesity increased Nppb expression, decreased end-diastolic volume and caused age-dependent diastolic dysfunction but not cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Maternal obesity also activated cardiac Akt and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling in male, but not in female, offspring and inhibited cardiac extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in both sexes. Normalising maternal circulating adiponectin concentrations by infusing obese dams with adiponectin prevented offspring diastolic dysfunction and ventricular dilation and normalised cardiac Akt-mTOR signalling irrespective of sex. Maternal adiponectin infusion also reduced cardiac Nppb expression and increased ERK1/2 signalling in offspring of obese dams. Adiponectin infusion did not prevent cardiomyocyte hypertrophy but reduced ventricular wall thickness in male offspring and increased collagen content in female offspring of obese dams, compared to controls. Low maternal adiponectin levels in obese mice in late pregnancy are mechanistically linked to in utero programming of cardiac dysfunction in their offspring. Interventions enhancing endogenous adiponectin secretion or signalling in obese pregnant women could prevent the development of cardiac dysfunction in their children.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: The rising prevalence of musculoskeletal pathologies in developed countries has caused a dramatic impact on social welfare. Amidst these musculoskeletal pathologies is Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a chronic systemic autoimmune disease that mostly affects the synovium. RA metabolic-associated alterations, including distorted adipokine production, enhance RA inflammatory environment. Among the altered adipokines, visfatin is particularly involved in RA inflammation and catabolism and stands out as an essential enzyme linked to critical cell features. Areas covered: We discuss the potential mechanism supporting the contribution of visfatin to RA and the association between RA and obesity. We discuss the repurposing of cancer-tested drugs to inhibit visfatin in the context of RA. Additionally, we address the possibility of combining these drugs with current RA therapy. Finally, we explore the future of visfatin as an RA biomarker or therapeutic target. Expert opinion: Inhibition of visfatin has become an interesting therapeutic approach for RA pathology. Such a feat has already been attained in oncology using small molecule inhibitors, which suggest that a similar course of action would be worth pursuing in the RA context. Visfatin will become an important biomarker and therapeutic target for RA.",

    "abstract": "Brown adipose tissue (BAT) has been regarded as a potential target organ to combat obesity and related metabolic disorders. However, the effect of BAT activation on the development of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) remains unclear. Diabetic mice were induced by streptozotocin (STZ) combined with a high-fat diet. To activate BAT, mice were administered 1 mg/kg per day, i.p., CL316,243, a &#x3b2;3 -adrenergic receptor agonist, for 4 weeks. Blood glucose, serum lipids, adipokines, 24-hour urinary albumin, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and circulating microRNA (miRNA) levels were analyzed, in addition to renal pathology. Histological changes (fibrosis, inflammation) were evaluated in the kidneys, as was the expression of oxidative stress-related genes. Renal signaling pathways (fibroblast growth factor [Fgf]21/&#x3b2;-klotho/FGF receptor 1c and AMP-activated protein kinase[AMPK]/sirtuin 1 [Sirt1]/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#x3b3; coactivator-1&#x3b1; [Pgc1&#x3b1;]) were also evaluated. Compared with untreated STZ-diabetic mice, CL316,243 treatment reduced blood glucose, albeit not significantly (20.58&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.55 vs 23.60&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.90 mM), and significantly decreased triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Simultaneously, BAT activation significantly decreased 24-hour urinary albumin (34.21&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;6.28 vs 70.46&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;15.81&#x2009;&#x3bc;g/24&#x2009;h; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) and 8-OHdG, improved renal fibrosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress, and ameliorated renal morphological abnormalities. In addition to enhancing BAT activity, CL316,243 significantly increased serum adiponectin concentrations and renal Fgf21 sensitivity, and reactivated the renal AMPK/Sirt1/Pgc1&#x3b1; signaling pathway. Furthermore, CL316,243 treatment increased levels of some circulating miRNAs and downregulated expression of their target genes in the kidney. Activating BAT could improve kidney injury in diabetic mice via metabolic improvements and renal AMPK activation by beneficial adipokines and miRNAs. &#x80cc;&#x666f;: &#x68d5;&#x8272;&#x8102;&#x80aa;&#x7ec4;&#x7ec7;(brown adipose tissue, BAT)&#x662f;&#x6f5c;&#x5728;&#x7684;&#x9632;&#x6cbb;&#x80a5;&#x80d6;&#x53ca;&#x76f8;&#x5173;&#x4ee3;&#x8c22;&#x7d0a;&#x4e71;&#x7684;&#x5668;&#x5b98;, &#x76ee;&#x524d;BAT&#x6fc0;&#x6d3b;&#x5bf9;&#x7cd6;&#x5c3f;&#x75c5;&#x80be;&#x810f;&#x75c5;(diabetic kidney disease, DKD)&#x7684;&#x5f71;&#x54cd;&#x5c1a;&#x4e0d;&#x6e05;&#x695a;&#x3002; &#x65b9;&#x6cd5;: &#x5bf9;&#x94fe;&#x8132;&#x4f50;&#x83cc;&#x7d20;(STZ)&#x8054;&#x5408;&#x9ad8;&#x8102;&#x996e;&#x98df;&#x8bf1;&#x5bfc;&#x7684;&#x7cd6;&#x5c3f;&#x75c5;&#x5c0f;&#x9f20;, &#x8fde;&#x7eed;4&#x5468;&#x6bcf;&#x5929;&#x7ed9;&#x4e88;1 mg/kg&#x7684;&#x3b2;3-&#x80be;&#x4e0a;&#x817a;&#x7d20;&#x80fd;&#x53d7;&#x4f53;&#x6fc0;&#x52a8;&#x5242;CL316,243&#x4ee5;&#x6fc0;&#x6d3b;BAT, &#x89c2;&#x5bdf;&#x5176;&#x5bf9;&#x5c0f;&#x9f20;&#x8840;&#x7cd6;&#x3001;&#x8840;&#x8102;&#x3001;&#x8102;&#x80aa;&#x56e0;&#x5b50;&#x3001;24 h&#x5c3f;&#x767d;&#x86cb;&#x767d;&#x3001;8-&#x7f9f;&#x57fa;&#x8131;&#x6c27;&#x9e1f;&#x82f7;(8-OHdG)&#x3001;&#x5faa;&#x73af;microRNA&#x5206;&#x5b50;(miRNA)&#x6c34;&#x5e73;&#x3001;&#x80be;&#x810f;&#x7ec4;&#x7ec7;&#x75c5;&#x7406;&#x3001;&#x80be;&#x810f;&#x7ea4;&#x7ef4;&#x5316;&#x3001;&#x708e;&#x75c7;&#x53ca;&#x6c27;&#x5316;&#x5e94;&#x6fc0;&#x7684;&#x5f71;&#x54cd;, &#x5e76;&#x5bf9;&#x80be;&#x810f;&#x6210;&#x7ea4;&#x7ef4;&#x7ec6;&#x80de;&#x751f;&#x957f;&#x56e0;&#x5b50;Fgf 21/&#x3b2;-klotho/FGFR1c&#x548c;AMPK/Sirt1/Pgc1&#x3b1;&#x4fe1;&#x53f7;&#x901a;&#x8def;&#x8fdb;&#x884c;&#x5206;&#x6790;&#x3002; &#x7ed3;&#x679c;: CL316,243&#x5e72;&#x9884;&#x7ec4;&#x7684;&#x7cd6;&#x5c3f;&#x75c5;&#x5c0f;&#x9f20;&#x7684;&#x8840;&#x7cd6;&#x6c34;&#x5e73;&#x5448;&#x964d;&#x4f4e;&#x8d8b;&#x52bf;(20.58&#xb1;3.55 vs. 23.60&#xb1;3.90&#x2009;mmol/L), &#x4e14;&#x7518;&#x6cb9;&#x4e09;&#x916f;&#x548c;&#x4f4e;&#x5bc6;&#x5ea6;&#x8102;&#x86cb;&#x767d;&#x80c6;&#x56fa;&#x9187;&#x660e;&#x663e;&#x964d;&#x4f4e;, &#x800c;&#x9ad8;&#x5bc6;&#x5ea6;&#x8102;&#x86cb;&#x767d;&#x80c6;&#x56fa;&#x9187;&#x660e;&#x663e;&#x5347;&#x9ad8;&#x3002;&#x540c;&#x65f6;, BAT&#x6fc0;&#x6d3b;&#x663e;&#x8457;&#x964d;&#x4f4e;&#x7cd6;&#x5c3f;&#x75c5;&#x5c0f;&#x9f20;&#x7684;24 h&#x5c3f;&#x767d;&#x86cb;&#x767d;&#x6c34;&#x5e73;(34.21&#xb1;6.28 vs. 70.46&#xb1;15.81 &#x3bc;g/24 h&#xff1b;P&lt;0.05)&#x548c;8-OHdG&#x6c34;&#x5e73;, &#x660e;&#x663e;&#x6539;&#x5584;&#x80be;&#x810f;&#x7ea4;&#x7ef4;&#x5316;&#x3001;&#x708e;&#x75c7;&#x548c;&#x6c27;&#x5316;&#x5e94;&#x6fc0;, &#x5e76;&#x6539;&#x5584;&#x80be;&#x810f;&#x5f62;&#x6001;&#x5b66;&#x5f02;&#x5e38;&#x3002;CL316,243&#x5e72;&#x9884;&#x4e0d;&#x4ec5;&#x589e;&#x5f3a;&#x4e86;&#x7cd6;&#x5c3f;&#x75c5;&#x5c0f;&#x9f20;&#x7684;BAT&#x6d3b;&#x6027;, &#x8fd8;&#x663e;&#x8457;&#x63d0;&#x9ad8;&#x4e86;&#x8840;&#x6e05;&#x8102;&#x8054;&#x7d20;&#x6c34;&#x5e73;&#x548c;&#x80be;&#x810f;Fgf 21&#x654f;&#x611f;&#x6027;, &#x6fc0;&#x6d3b;&#x4e86;&#x80be;&#x810f;AMPK/Sirt1/Pgc1&#x3b1;&#x4fe1;&#x53f7;&#x901a;&#x8def;&#x3002;&#x6b64;&#x5916;, CL316,243&#x5e72;&#x9884;&#x53ef;&#x663e;&#x8457;&#x589e;&#x52a0;&#x67d0;&#x4e9b;&#x5faa;&#x73af;miRNAs&#x6c34;&#x5e73;, &#x5e76;&#x4e0b;&#x8c03;&#x76f8;&#x5e94;&#x7684;&#x80be;&#x810f;&#x9776;&#x57fa;&#x56e0;&#x8868;&#x8fbe;&#x3002; &#x7ed3;&#x8bba;: BAT&#x6fc0;&#x6d3b;&#x53ef;&#x663e;&#x8457;&#x6539;&#x5584;&#x7cd6;&#x5c3f;&#x75c5;&#x5c0f;&#x9f20;&#x7684;&#x4ee3;&#x8c22;&#x7d0a;&#x4e71;, &#x589e;&#x52a0;&#x8840;&#x4e2d;&#x8102;&#x80aa;&#x56e0;&#x5b50;&#x6c34;&#x5e73;&#x3001;&#x4e0a;&#x8c03;&#x5faa;&#x73af;&#x4e2d;&#x67d0;&#x4e9b;miRNAs&#x8868;&#x8fbe;&#x3001;&#x6fc0;&#x6d3b;&#x80be;&#x810f;AMPK&#x4fe1;&#x53f7;&#x901a;&#x8def;, &#x4ece;&#x800c;&#x53d1;&#x6325;&#x5bf9;&#x7cd6;&#x5c3f;&#x75c5;&#x5c0f;&#x9f20;&#x7684;&#x80be;&#x810f;&#x4fdd;&#x62a4;&#x4f5c;&#x7528;&#x3002;.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most common complications of diabetes, and currently the first end-stage renal disease worldwide. New strategies to treat DN using agents that target inflammatory pathways have attracted special interest. Recent pieces of evidences suggest a promising effect of IL-17A, the Th17 effector cytokine. Among experimental DN models, mouse strain BTBR ob/ob (leptin deficiency mutation) develops histological features similar to human DN, which means an opportunity to study mechanisms and novel therapies aimed at DN regression. We found that BTBR ob/ob mice presented renal activation of the factors controlling Th17 differentiation. The presence of IL-17A-expressing cells, mainly CD4<sup>+</sup> and &#x3b3;&#x3b4; lymphocytes, was associated with upregulation of proinflammatory factors, macrophage infiltration and the beginning of renal damage. To study IL-17A involvement in experimental DN pathogenesis, treatment with an IL-17A neutralizing antibody was carried out starting when the renal damage had already appeared. IL-17A blockade ameliorated renal dysfunction and disease progression in BTBR ob/ob mice. These beneficial effects correlated to podocyte number restoration and inhibition of NF-&#x3ba;B/proinflammatory factors linked to a decrease in renal inflammatory-cell infiltration. These data demonstrate that IL-17A takes part in diabetes-mediated renal damage and could be a promising therapeutic target to improve DN.",

    "abstract": "Gouty arthritis is an inflammatory disease that is triggered by abnormal uric acid metabolism, which is usually attributed to obesity, a risk factor of hyperuricemia and gout attack. A high level of leptin in plasma is a marker of individuals with obesity. Population studies show that leptin promotes obesity-related arthritis, such as osteoarthritis, but it is unknown whether leptin contributes to gouty arthritis, another form of obesity-related arthritis. Our present study showed that the levels of leptin and leptin receptor in patients with active gouty arthritis were elevated. Leptin facilitates the stimulation of human synoviocytes, mouse peritoneal macrophages, and HL-60 cells induced by monosodium urate, leading to higher levels of acute gout-related proinflammatory factors. Leptin obviously exacerbates the inflammation of monosodium urate-induced acute gouty arthritis in wild-type mice, whereas that in leptin-deficient C57BL6/J<sup>ob/ob</sup> mice is markedly alleviated. The proinflammatory effect of leptin in acute gouty arthritis is partly mediated by mTORC1 signaling pathway. Our study reveals that leptin may serve as a novel prevention and treatment target in acute gouty arthritis.",

    "title": "Prevention of kidney cell damage in hyperglycaemia condition by adiponectin.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin (APN) is an adipocytokine, secreted from adipose tissue and has anti-inflammatory, anti-ageing, and antidiabetic properties. Hyperglycaemia can damage the renal cells, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), along with Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), have an important role in kidney cell response to hyperglycaemia. Therefore, understanding the relationship between adiponectin, mTOR, and SIRT1 proteins is beneficial for deciphering the mechanism of adiponectin function. In this study, Human Embryonic Kidney-293 (HEK-293) cells were cultured under normal and high-glucose condition, with and without APN (1, 10, and 100&#xa0;ng/mL) for 48&#xa0;hours. mTOR protein expression was evaluated by western blot analysis, and SIRT1 protein was assessed using ELISA method. To evaluate hyperglycaemia-mediated cytotoxicity, cell viability was determined using MTT assay. Data showed that APN in high dose (100&#xa0;ng/mL) significantly reduced the expression of mTOR and p-mTOR, increased SIRT1 protein, and also improved cell viability compared with the control high glucose (p&#xa0;&#x2264;&#xa0;0.05). According to this results, APN can be useful in preventing renal cell damage, by affecting on the expression of mTOR and SIRT1 proteins, as well as increasing the survival of kidney cells in hyperglycaemia conditions. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Adiponectin triggered mTOR/p-mTOR/SIRT1 pathway and decreased cell death in human kidney cells. Our findings provide preliminary experimental data that support further studies on the potential therapeutic role of adiponectin in diabetes and diabetic-induced metabolic complications.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the molecular mechanism of Adenovirus type 36 (Ad36) in adipocyte differentiation and glucolipid metabolism. Rat obesity model was established by Ad36 infection and high-fat diet, respectively. Comparison of the body weight, clinical biochemical indicators, insulin sensitivity and lipid heterotopic deposition between these two models was performed. Ad36-induced adipocyte in vitro model was also established. The binding rate of FoxO1, PPAR&#x3b3; and its target gene promoter was detected using ChIP. The mRNA and protein expression levels of PPAR&#x3b3; and downstream target genes were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Oil red O staining was used to measure differentiation into adipocyte. Wortmannin (WM), inhibitor of PI3K, was used to act on Ad36-induced hADSCs. Ad36-induced obese rats did not exhibit disorders in blood glucose and blood TG, insulin resistance and lipid ectopic deposition. The expression of Adipoq, Lpin1 and Glut4 in the adipose tissue increased. Oil red O staining showed that Ad36 induced the differentiation of hAMSCs into human adipocytes in vitro. During this process, the binding rate of FoxO1 and PPAR&#x3b3; promoter regions was weakened. However, the binding rate of the transcription factor PPAR&#x3b3; to its target genes Acc, Adipoq, Lpin1 and Glut4 was enhanced, and thus increased the protein expression of P-FoxO1, PPAR&#x3b3;2, ACC, LPIN1, GLUT4 and ADIPOQ. The PI3K inhibitor Wortmannin reduced the expression of P-Akt, P-FoxO1 and PPAR&#x3b3;2, thereby inhibiting adipogenesis of hADSC. Ad36 may promote fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis, and improve insulin sensitivity by affecting the PI3K/Akt/FoxO1/PPAR&#x3b3; signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Osteoblast differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) is stimulated by 1&#x3b1;,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [1&#x3b1;,25(OH)2D3] and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol [25(OH)D3]; the latter's effects require intracellular hydroxylation to 1&#x3b1;,25(OH)2D3. Thus, hMSCs are both a source of and target for 1&#x3b1;,25(OH)2D3. Megalin is a transmembrane receptor for serum d-binding protein (DBP) in kidney cells and is required for uptake of the 25(OH)D3-DBP complex. We tested the hypothesis that megalin is required for D actions in hMSCs with cells from surgically discarded marrow for RT-PCR, for effects of 25(OH)D3 and 1&#x3b1;,25(OH)2D3, for 1&#x3b1;,25(OH)2D3 biosynthesis, for osteoblastogenesis, and for small interfering RNA for megalin (si-Meg) and control (si-Ctr). In hMSCs with high constitutive megalin expression, both 1&#x3b1;,25(OH)2D3 and 25(OH)D3 stimulated osteoblastogenesis (P &lt; 0.05), but only 1&#x3b1;,25(OH)2D3 did so in hMSCs with lower megalin (lo-Meg, P &lt; 0.001) or in si-Meg cells (P &lt; 0.05). In addition, 1&#x3b1;,25(OH)2D3 biosynthesis was significantly lower in lo-Meg (46%, P = 0.034) and in si-Meg (23%, P &lt; 0.001) than each control. Leptin significantly stimulated megalin expression 2.1-fold in lo-Meg cells (P &lt; 0.01). These studies show that megalin is expressed in hMSCs and is required for the biosynthesis of 1&#x3b1;,25(OH)2D3 and for the 25(OH)D3/DBP complex to stimulate vitamin D receptor targets and osteoblastogenesis.-Gao, Y., Zhou, S., Luu, S., Glowacki, J.

    "abstract": "Adipose tissue (AT), an endocrine organ that modulates several physiological functions by synthesizing and releasing adipokines such as adiponectin, is a metabolic target of triiodothyronine (T3). T3 and adiponectin play important roles in controlling normal metabolic functions such as stimulation of fatty acid oxidation and increase in thermogenesis. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is important for the differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes and can be activated by T3 for the transcription of specific genes, such as adiponectin. We examined the role of PI3K in adiponectin modulation by T3 action in murine adipocytes (3T3-L1). The 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with 1000 nM T3 for 1 h in the presence or absence of 50 &#x3bc;M LY294002 (LY), a PI3K inhibitor. Then, we assessed the expression of adiponectin and the phosphorylated serine/threonine kinase Akt (pAkt), a PI3K signaling protein, in the adipocytes. Adiponectin and pAKT levels were higher in the T3-adipocyte cells, whereas in the LY group adiponectin was elevated and pAKT was decreased compared to the control (C). PI3K pathway inhibition for 1 h and posterior treatment with T3, in LY + T3, reduced the adiponectin level and increased pAKT levels compared to those in LY. T3 stimulated adiponectin levels by PI3K pathway activation and T3 can compensate alteration in the PI3K pathway, because with inhibition of the pathway it is able to maintain the basal levels of adiponectin and pAKT.",

    "abstract": "Convergent lines of evidence indicate the critical roles of adiponectin in regulating neural functions on different levels. Because of the importance in maintaining neural plasticity including adult neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, adiponectin has the potential to serve as the treatment targets in therapies of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Hence, systematic review is needed to summarize how adiponectin works in the brain, and how the adiponectin pathway is employed as the treatment method needs to be determined. Moreover, the benefits of adiponectin as the regulator for neural plasticity such as synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis have been supported by many literatures. In the current article, we reviewed the functions of adiponectin in different types of neural plasticity. We also demonstrated the potential value of adiponectin as the treatment target for different types of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Taken together, this review offers a new insight about adiponectin as the ideal target to develop the new treatment methods against neurodegeneration or psychiatric diseases.",

    "abstract": "The adipocyte-secreting adipokine, resistin, may play a critical role in the modulation of inflammatory diseases. Migration and infiltration of mononuclear cells into inflammatory sites are critical events during the development of osteoarthritis (OA). Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), also known as chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), plays a critical role in the regulation of monocyte migration and infiltration. In this study, we show how resistin promotes MCP-1 expression in OA synovial fibroblasts and monocyte migration. We used qPCR to detect MCP-1 and miRNA expression. THP-1 migration was investigated by Transwell assay. The Western blotting was used to examine the resistinmediated signaling pathways. Resistin activated the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways, while PI3K, Akt and mTOR inhibitors or small interfering RNAs diminished resistin-induced MCP-1 expression and monocyte migration. We also demonstrate that resistin stimulates MCP-1mediated monocyte migration by suppressing microRNA (miR)-33a and miR-33b via the PI3K, Akt and mTOR signaling pathways. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms of resistin action that may have therapeutic implications for patients with OA.",

    "abstract": "Interactions among cytokines have important roles in the inflammatory processes underlying Guillain-Barr&#xe9; syndrome (GBS). Resistin and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) are involved in many inflammatory processes. This study examined 51 GBS patients, and found that serum resistin levels were elevated in 51 patients with GBS and correlated with HMGB1 levels. In vitro, resistin induced the release of HMGB1, interleukin (IL)-1&#x3b2;, and IL-6 in THP-1 macrophages. This process was dependent on activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and NF-&#x3ba;B signaling pathways. These results suggest that signaling between resistin and HMGB1 might be a potential therapeutic target in GBS.",

    "abstract": "Resistin may be involved in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA), but a systematic understanding of the role of resistin in OA is lacking. We reviewed studies that evaluated the role of resistin in OA. The expression levels of resistin in vitro experiments and OA/rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients were analyzed. We also studied potential resistin receptors and the signaling pathways that these receptors activate, ultimately leading to cartilage degeneration. Resistin levels in both the serum and synovial fluid were higher in OA and RA patients than in healthy subjects. Overall, resistin levels are much higher in serum than in synovial fluid. In human cartilage, resistin induces the expression of proinflammatory factors such as degradative enzymes, leading to the inhibition of cartilage matrix synthesis, perhaps by binding to Toll-like receptor 4 and the adenylyl cyclase-associated protein 1 receptor, which then activates the p38-mitogen-activated phosphate kinase, protein kinase A-cyclic AMP, nuclear factor-&#x3ba;B, and C/enhancer-binding protein &#x3b2; signaling pathways. Resistin levels are higher in OA patients than in healthy controls; however, the precise role of resistin in the pathogenesis of OA needs to be studied further. Resistin may be a novel therapeutic target in OA in the future.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary hypertension is an umbrella term including many different disorders causing an increase of the mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) &#x2265; 25 mmHg. Recent data revealed a strong association between obesity and pulmonary hypertension. Adiponectin is a protein synthetized by the adipose tissue with pleiotropic effects on inflammation and cell proliferation, with a potential protective role on the pulmonary vasculature. Both in vivo and in vitro studies documented that adiponectin is an endogenous modulator of NO production and interferes with AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-&#x3ba;&#x3b2;) signaling preventing endothelial dysfunction and proliferation. Furthermore, adiponectin ameliorates insulin resistance by mediating the biological effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR&#x3b3;). Therefore, adiponectin modulation emerged as a theoretical target for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension, currently under investigation. Recently, consistent data showed that hypoglycemic agents targeting PPAR&#x3b3; as well as renin&#x207b;angiotensin system inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor blockers may influence pulmonary hemodynamics in different models of pulmonary hypertension.",

We searched PubMed with the keywords (obesity[Title/Abstract]) AND mutation[Title/Abstract], and OMIM with the keyword obesity. In both cases, we selected non-syndromic Mendelian obesity. We then searched ClinicalTrials.gov with the following criteria: recruitment status: active, not recruiting and completed; study type: interventional (clinical trial); study results: with results; type of intervention: drug or dietary supplement. From the PubMed and OMIM searches we obtained a total of 15 genes associated with monogenic Mendelian obesity. From ClinicalTrials.gov we retrieved 46 completed or active trials of pharmacological treatments. We summarized the molecular bases of Mendelian obesity and searched for any clinical trials completed or underway for the treatment of severe forms of obesity. Most Mendelian obesities are linked to dysfunctions in the leptin/melanocortin signaling pathway, and most of the possible drugs target this pathway in order to improve energy expenditure and reduce food intake.",

    "abstract": "Global consumption of protein per capita is rising, while rates of infertility are increasing. However, a clear relationship between protein intake and reproductive health has not been demonstrated. The activation of the quiescent primordial follicles is the first step of folliculogenesis, and their activation must be tightly controlled to prevent premature exhaustion of the ovarian follicular reserve. The primordial follicle reserve of wild-type or liver-specific ablation of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) in mice, subjected to limited or excessive protein diets or oral gavage test, were detected in vivo. Mouse ovary organ cultures were used to examine the direct role of metabolites or metabolic hormones on primordial follicle activation. Mouse primordial follicle activation, was reduced by restricted protein intake and was accelerated by excessive protein intake, in an ovarian mTORC1 signaling-dependent manner. Furthermore, restricted or excessive protein intake resulted in an augmentation or decline of oocyte number and fertility at older age, respectively. Liver-specific ablation of FGF21, which resulted in a reduction of 87% in circulating FGF21, abrogated the preserving effect of low-protein intake on primordial follicle pool. Interestingly, FGF21 had no direct effect on the activation of primordial follicles, but instead required an adipokine adiponectin. Moreover, AdipoRon, an oral adiponectin receptor agonist, prevented the over-activation effect of excessive protein intake on primordial follicle activation. Dietary protein consumption controlled ovarian primordial follicle reserve and fertility, which required coordination between FGF21 and adiponectin.

    "title": "Autophagy in Adipocyte Browning: Emerging Drug Target for Intervention in Obesity.",
    "abstract": "Autophagy, lipophagy, and mitophagy are considered to be the major recycling processes for protein aggregates, excess fat, and damaged mitochondria in adipose tissues in response to nutrient status-associated stress, oxidative stress, and genotoxic stress in the human body. Obesity with increased body weight is often associated with white adipose tissue (WAT) hypertrophy and hyperplasia and/or beige/brown adipose tissue atrophy and aplasia, which significantly contribute to the imbalance in lipid metabolism, adipocytokine secretion, free fatty acid release, and mitochondria function. In recent studies, hyperactive autophagy in WAT was observed in obese and diabetic patients, and inhibition of adipose autophagy through targeted deletion of autophagy genes in mice improved anti-obesity phenotypes. In addition, active mitochondria clearance through activation of autophagy was required for beige/brown fat whitening - that is, conversion to white fat. However, inhibition of autophagy seemed detrimental in hypermetabolic conditions such as hepatic steatosis, atherosclerosis, thermal injury, sepsis, and cachexia through an increase in free fatty acid and glycerol release from WAT. The emerging concept of white fat browning-conversion to beige/brown fat-has been controversial in its anti-obesity effect through facilitation of weight loss and improving metabolic health. Thus, proper regulation of autophagy activity fit to an individual metabolic profile is necessary to ensure balance in adipose tissue metabolism and function, and to further prevent metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes. In this review, we summarize the effect of autophagy in adipose tissue browning in the context of obesity prevention and its potential as a promising target for the development of anti-obesity drugs.",

    "abstract": "Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) has been considered as a validated biological target for type 2 diabetes treatment, but past endeavors to develop inhibitors of PTP1B into drugs have been unsuccessful. Two challenging aspects are selective inhibition and cell permeability. A structure-based strategy was employed to develop uncharged bromophenols as a new series of PTP1B inhibitors. The most potent compound 22 (LXQ46) inhibited PTP1B with an IC50 value of 0.190&#x202f;&#x3bc;M, and showed remarkable selectivity over other protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs, 20-200 folds). In the SPR study, increasing concentrations of compound 22 led to concentration-dependent increases in binding responses, indicating that compound 22 could bind to the surface of PTP1B via noncovalent means. By treating insulin-resistant C2C12 myotubes with compound 22, enhanced insulin and leptin signaling pathways were observed. Long-term oral administration of compound 22 reduced the blood glucose level of diabetic BKS db mice. The glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) and insulin tolerance tests (ITT) in BKS db mice showed that oral administration of compound 22 could increase insulin sensitivity. In addition, long-term oral administration of compound 22 could protect mice from obesity, which was not the result of toxicity. Our pharmacokinetics results from the rat-based assays showed that orally administered compound 22 was absorbed rapidly from the gastrointestinal tract, extensively distributed to the tissues, and rapidly eliminated from the body. All these results indicate that compound 22 could serve as a qualified agent to treat type II diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that leptin is associated to the tumorigenesis and progression of breast cancer (BC). However, these studies remain inconsistent. Thus, a meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the role of leptin in the patients with BC. A systematic search in PubMed, Embase, ISI Web of Science, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases was conducted up to September 1, 2017. The standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was applied to pool the effect size. A funnel plot and Egger test were used to evaluate publication bias. Finally, 43 eligible studies were included in the current meta-analysis. Overall, serum leptin levels in BC cases were significantly higher compared with the controls (SMD = 0.61, P&#x200a;&lt;.0001). When subgroup analyses were restricted to ethnicity and menstrual status, higher serum leptin concentration was also detected in patients with BC. Moreover, BC cases with body mass index (BMI) &gt;25 indicated significantly higher serum leptin levels (SMD = 1.48, P = .034). Furthermore, the BC cases with lymph node metastases showed significantly higher serum leptin concentration (SMD = 0.53, P&#x200a;=&#x200a;.015). The present meta-analysis suggests that the serum leptin may profiles as a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and metastasis of BC. In addition, leptin will provide useful information for a therapeutic target to treat BC.",

    "title": "Reduced delivery of epididymal adipocyte-derived exosomal resistin is essential for melatonin ameliorating hepatic steatosis in mice.",
    "abstract": "Adipocyte-derived exosomes (Exos) serve as bioinformation-containing messengers in cell-to-cell communications, and numerous reports demonstrate that resistin, an adipokine, is strongly associated with hepatic steatosis and other fatty liver diseases, suggesting that adipose dysfunction-generated altered pattern of exosomal cytokines may contribute to shaping the physiological activities in liver. Admittedly, melatonin-mediated positive effects on various tissues/organs have been respectively reported, but regulatory mechanisms of melatonin on the crosstalk between adipose tissue and liver have been investigated rarely. Overall, we hypothesize that the crosstalk originating from adipose tissue may be another worthy regulatory pathway for melatonin ameliorating of hepatic steatosis. Here, we first found the amount of adipocyte-derived exosomal resistin to be significantly decreased by melatonin supplementation. Compared to mice with ExosHFD or Exosresistin treatment, ExosMT remarkably ameliorated hepatic steatosis. Further test demonstrated that resistin was a pivotal cytokine which repressed phosphorylation of 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase &#x3b1; (pAMPK&#x3b1; Thr<sup>172</sup> ) to trigger endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, resulting in hepatic steatosis, whereas ExosMT reversed these risks in hepatocytes. In adipocytes, we identified melatonin to reduce the production of resistin through the brain and muscle arnt-like protein 1 (Bmal1) transcriptional inhibition. Notably, we also confirmed that melatonin enhanced N<sup>6</sup> -Methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup> A) RNA demethylation to degrade resistin mRNA in adipocytes. Overall, melatonin decreases traffic volume of adipocyte-generated exosomal resistin from adipocytes to hepatocytes, which further alleviates ER stress-induced hepatic steatosis. Our findings illustrate a novel melatonin-mediated regulatory pathway from adipocytes to hepatocytes, indicating that adipocyte-derived exosome is a new potential target for treating obesity and related hepatorenal syndrome.",

    "title": "Role of Adiponectin in prostate cancer.",
    "abstract": "Obesity is defined as a chronic and excessive growth of adipose tissue. It has been associated with a high risk for development and progression of obesity-associated malignancies, while adipokines may mediate this association. Adiponectin is an adipose tissue-derived adipokines, with significant anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, anti-atherosclerotic and anti-proliferative properties. Plasma adiponectin levels are decreased in obese individuals, and this feature is closely correlated with development of several metabolic, immunological and neoplastic diseases. Recent studies have shown that prostate cancer patients have lower serum adiponectin levels and decreased expression of adiponectin receptors in tumor tissues, which suggests plasma adiponectin level is a risk factor for prostate cancer. Furthermore, exogenous adiponectin has exhibited therapeutic potential in animal models. In this review, we focus on the potential role of adiponectin and the underlying mechanism of adiponectin in the development and progression of prostate cancer. Exploring the signaling pathways linking adiponectin with tumorigenesis might provide a potential target for therapy.",

    "title": "Leptin-elicited miRNA-342-3p potentiates gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.",
    "abstract": "Although obesity (characterized by high levels of serum leptin) and deregulated expression of miRNAs are both functionally implicated in the pathogenesis of chemoresistance of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the mechanistic link synchronize these two factors remain poorly understood. Here, we show that expression levels of obesity-associated miR-342-3p were significantly upregulated in gemcitabine (GEM)-resistant PDAC tissues and cells, and this upregulation was associated with poor postchemotherapy prognosis. Using pharmacological approaches, we observed that crosstalk between leptin and Notch signaling pathways regulated fundamentally the miR-342-3p expression in GEM-resistant PDAC cells. Functionally, forced expression of miR-342-3p exhibited a prosurvival effect and potentiated GEM resistance, whereas inhibition of miR-342-3p expression noticeably ameliorated chemosensitivity in GEM-resistant PDAC cells. By employing bioinformatics analysis, point mutation and luciferase reporter assays, we further identified the 3'-UTR of tumor suppressor Kr&#xfc;ppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) as the direct target of miR-342-3p. Therapeutically, stable expression of the exogenous KLF6 was sufficient to abrogate the pro-survival effects of miR-342-3p in GEM-treated PDAC cells. Taken together, these results suggest that leptin-elicited miR-342-3p upregulation mediates, at least partially, the GEM resistance through inhibition of KLF6 signaling in PDAC. Considering the indispensable function of miR-342-3p during adipogenesis, this obesity-associated miRNA may operate as a novel posttranscriptional integrator linking lipid homeostasis and pancreatic chemoresistance.",

    "title": "Resistin facilitates VEGF-A-dependent angiogenesis by inhibiting miR-16-5p in human chondrosarcoma cells.",
    "abstract": "Resistin is an adipokine that is associated with obesity, inflammation, and various cancers. Chondrosarcomas are primary malignant bone tumors that have a poor prognosis. VEGF-A is a critical angiogenic factor that is known to promote angiogenesis and metastasis in chondrosarcoma. It is unknown as to whether resistin affects human chondrosarcoma angiogenesis. In this study, we show how resistin promotes VEGF-A expression and subsequently induces angiogenesis of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). Resistin treatment activated the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt signaling pathways, while PI3K and Akt inhibitors or siRNA diminished resistin-induced VEGF-A expression. In vitro and in vivo studies revealed the downregulation of micro RNA (miR)-16-5p in resistin-induced VEGF-A expression and EPCs angiogenesis. We also found a positive correlation between resistin and VEGF-A expression, and a negative correlation between resistin and VEGF-A with miR-16-5p in chondrosarcoma patients. These findings reveal that resistin facilitates VEGF-A expression and angiogenesis through the inhibition of miR-16-5p expression via PI3K/Akt signaling cascades. Resistin may be a promising target in chondrosarcoma angiogenesis.",

    "title": "Leptin Receptor as a Potential Target to Inhibit Human Testicular Seminoma Growth.",
    "abstract": "Although in past decades the adipokine leptin and its own receptor have been considered as significant cancer biomarkers, their potential involvement in human testicular seminoma growth and progression remains unexplored. Here, we showed that the expression of leptin and its receptor was significantly higher in human testicular seminoma compared with normal adult testis. Human seminoma cell line TCam-2 also expressed leptin along with the long and short isoforms of leptin receptor, and in response to leptin treatment showed enhanced activation of its downstream effectors. In line with these results, leptin stimulation significantly increased the proliferation and migration of TCam-2 cells. Treatment of TCam-2 cells with the peptide Leu-Asp-Phe-Ile (LDFI), a full leptin-receptor antagonist, completely reversed the leptin-mediated effects on cell growth and motility as well as reduced the expression of several leptin-induced target genes. More importantly, the in&#xa0;vivo xenograft experiments showed that LDFI treatment markedly decreased seminoma tumor growth. Interestingly, LDFI-treated tumors showed reduced levels of the proliferation marker Ki-67 as well as decreased expression of leptin-regulated genes. Taken together, these data identify, for the first time, leptin as a key factor able to affect testicular seminoma behavior, highlighting leptin receptor as a potential target for novel potential treatments in this type of cancer.",

Lifestyle advice is the first step in the ADA/EASD consensus guidelines followed by metformin therapy. Aerobic exercise (AE) can increase insulin sensitivity by several molecular pathways including upregulation of insulin transporters in the cellular membrane of insulin-dependent cells. In addition, AE improves insulin sensitivity by amelioration of the pathophysiologic pathways involved in insulin resistance such as the reduction of adipokines, inflammatory and oxidative stress responses, and improvement of insulin signal transduction via different molecular pathways.

    "abstract": "Metabolic complications in an obese state can be aggravated by an abnormal inflammatory response and enhanced production of reactive oxygen species. Pro-inflammatory response is known to be associated with the formation of toxic reactive oxygen species and subsequent generation of oxidative stress. Indeed, adipocytes from obese individuals display an altered adipokine profile, with upregulated expression and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x3b1;) and interleukin (IL-6). Interestingly, natural compounds, including phenolic enriched foods are increasingly explored for their ameliorative effects against various metabolic diseases. Of interest is gallic acid, a trihydroxybenzoic acid that has progressively demonstrated robust anti-obesity capabilities in various experimental models. In addition to reducing excessive lipid storage in obese subjects, gallic acid has been shown to specifically target the adipose tissue to suppress lipogenesis, improve insulin signaling, and concomitantly combat raised pro-inflammatory response and oxidative stress. This review will revise mechanisms involved in the pathophysiological effects of inflammation and oxidative stress in an obese state. To better inform on its therapeutic potential and improvement of human health, available evidence reporting on the anti-obesity properties of gallic acid and its derivatives will be discussed, with emphases on its modulatory effect on molecular mechanisms involved in insulin signaling, inflammation and oxidative stress.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Fibrotic disorders are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality; hence effective treatments are still vigorously sought. AdipoRs (AdipoR1 and Adipo2) are responsible for the antifibrotic effects of adiponectin (APN). APN exerts antifibrotic effects by binding to its receptors. APN concentration and AdipoR expression are closely associated with fibrotic disorders. Decreased AdipoR expression may reduce APN-AdipoR signaling, while the upregulation of AdipoR expression may restore the anti-fibrotic effects of APN. Loss of APN signaling exacerbates fibrosis in vivo and in vitro. Areas covered: We assess the relationship between APN and fibrotic disorders, the structure of receptors for APN and the pathways accounting for APN or its analogs blocking fibrotic disorders. This article also discusses designed APN products and their therapeutic prospects for fibrotic disorders. Expert opinion: AdipoRs have a critical role in blocking fibrosis. The development of small-molecule agonists toward this target represents a valid drug development pathway.",

    "abstract": "To report changes in body composition and biochemical parameters in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) after switching from multiple daily injection (MDI) to continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). 31 patients switched over from MDI to CSII. Body composition, biochemical parameters, glycaemic variability (GV) and level of physical activity were evaluated before and 6 months on CSII. In both sexes, we found an increase in skeletal muscle mass (SMM), (p = 0.008; 0.008). In men, there was mainly a decrease in visceral fat area (VFA), (p = 0.028) and in women there was decrease of total body fat (TBF), (p = 0.020) and non-significant decrease of VFA (p = 0.098). SMM inversely correlated with VFA in men (p = -0.001) and with TBF in women (p = -0.005 ). GV was decreased generally and correlated inversely with TBF in men only (p = -0.026). Physical activity was increased and correlated inversely with VFA in men (p = -0.002) and in women (p = -0.006). Using CSII in T1D leads to a significant increase of SMM in both sexes to a decrease of VFA in men and to a non-significant decrease of VFA in women. Changes in adipose tissue and SMM were also related to increased physical activity and to decreased GV.",

    "title": "Silica nanoparticles trigger hepatic lipid-metabolism disorder in vivo and in vitro.",
    "abstract": "As a promising nanocarrier in biomedical fields, silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) could transfer from the circulatory system to multiple organs. Among these, blood-liver molecular exchange is a critical factor in biological response to NPs. However, the potential effect of SiNPs on hepatic lipid metabolism is unclear. In this study, we employed three models to attempt discover whether and how SiNPs disturb hepatic lipid metabolism in vivo and in vitro. Firstly we used ICR mice models to evaulated the effects of SiNPs on the serum and hepatic lipid levels through repeated intravenous administration, meanwhile, the protein expressions of protein markers of lipogenesis (ACC1 and FAS), the key enzyme of fatty acid &#x3b2;-oxidation, CPT1A,and leptin levels in liver were detected by western blot. For verification studies, the model organism zebrafish and cultured hepatic L02 cells were further performed. The TLR5 and adipocytokine-signaling pathway were verified. Inflammatory cell infiltration and mild steatosis induced by SiNPs were observed in the liver. Cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were elevated significantly in both blood serum and liver tissue, whereas the ratio of high-density:low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was markedly decreased. Protein markers of lipogenesis (ACC1 and FAS) were elevated significantly in liver tissue, whereas the key enzyme of fatty acid &#x3b2;-oxidation, CPT1A, was decreased significantly. Interestingly, leptin levels in the SiNP-treated group were also elevated markedly. In addition, SiNPs caused hepatic damage and steatosis in zebrafish and enhanced hyperlipemia in high-cholesterol diet zebrafish. Similarly, SiNPs increased the release of inflammatory cytokines (IL1&#x3b2;, IL6, IL8, and TNF&#x3b1;) and activated the TLR5-signaling pathway in hepatic L02 cells. In summary, our study found that SiNPs triggered hyperlipemia and hepatic steatosis via the TLR5-signaling pathway. This suggests that regulation of TLR5 could be a novel therapeutic target to reduce side effects of NPs in living organisms.",

    "abstract": "Women with obesity usually need larger doses of FSH for ovarian stimulation, resulting in poor outcomes; however, the mechanism is still unclear. To investigate the molecular regulation of FSH receptor (FSHR) expression associated with obesity. Case-control study to improve in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes. Women with obesity (82) and women who were overweight (457) undergoing IVF and 1790 age-matched controls with normal weight from our reproductive medicine center. FSHR expression was decreased in parallel with body mass index (BMI), whereas the estradiol (E2) level on the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) trigger day was significantly lower. FSHR expression in human granulosa cells (hGCs), both mRNA (P = 0.02) and protein (P = 0.001) levels, was decreased in women who were overweight or obese. Both insulin (P &lt; 0.001) and glucose (P = 0.0017) levels were positively correlated with BMI in fasting blood and follicle fluids (FFs) but not with FFs leptin level. We treated human granulosa-like tumor cells (KGN) cells with insulin; E2 production was compromised; the level of phosphorylated (p)-protein kinase B (p-Akt2) decreased, whereas p-glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) increased; and there were similar changes in hGCs from women with obesity. Stimulated hGCs from women with obesity with compound 21 (CP21), an inhibitor of GSK3&#x3b2;, resulted in upregulated &#x3b2;-catenin activation and increased FSHR expression. CP21 also increased the expression of insulin receptor substrate 1 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), as well as p-Akt2. Women with obesity in IVF were associated with reduced FSHR expression and E2 production caused by a dysfunctional insulin pathway. Decreased FSHR expression in hGCs from women with obesity and insulin-treated KGN cells could be rescued by an inhibitor of GSK3&#x3b2;, which might be a potential target for the improvement of the impaired FSH-stimulation response in women with obesity.",

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a joint degenerative biomechanical disorder involving immunity, metabolic alterations, inflammation, and cartilage degradation, where chondrocytes play a pivotal role. OA has not effective pharmacological treatments and new therapeutic targets are needed. Adipokines contribute to the low-grade systemic inflammation in OA. Here, we explored novel molecular mechanisms of sodium butyrate (BuNa) in modulating inflammation and chemotaxis in chondrocytes, demonstrating the direct involvement of its G protein-coupled receptor (GPR)-43. ATDC5 murine chondrocytes were stimulated with interleukin (IL)-1&#x3b2;, in the presence or not of BuNa, for 24 h. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate the expression of inflammatory mediators and structural proteins. Butyrate reduced the expression of canonic pro-inflammatory mediators (Nos2, COX-2, IL-6), pro-inflammatory adipokines (lipocalin-2 and nesfatin-1) and adhesion molecule (VCAM-1 and ICAM-1) in IL-1&#x3b2;-stimulated chondrocytes, inhibiting several inflammatory signalling pathways (NF&#x3ba;B, MAPKinase, AMPK-&#x3b1;, PI3K/Akt). Butyrate also reduced metalloproteinase production and limited the loss of type II collagen in IL-1&#x3b2;-inflamed chondrocytes. The chemoattractant effect of butyrate, after different inflammatory challenges, was revealed by increased annexin (AnxA)1 levels and chemokines expression. The chemoattractant and anti-inflammatory activities of butyrate were completely blunted by GPR43 silencing using RNA interference. Taken together, our data suggest the potential application of sodium butyrate as a novel candidate in a multi-target approach for the treatment of chondrocyte inflammation and cartilage degenerative process.",

    "abstract": "Different adiponectin isoforms appear to be differentially involved in the pathogenesis of various diseases. The purpose of this study was to generate monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific to different adiponectin isoforms and investigate whether these mAbs have potential as therapeutic agents for such diseases. Hybridoma cells producing monoclonal antibodies were generated and screened using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting for the production of mAbs recognizing human adiponectin isoforms. The mAb from hybridoma clone KH7-41 recognized both the middle molecular weight (MMW) (hexamer) and low molecular weight (LMW) (trimer) isoforms of adiponectin in human serum, whereas the KH7-33 mAb detected only MMW (hexamer) adiponectin. The KH4-8 clone recognized both the high molecular weight (HMW) (multimer) and MMW adiponectin isoforms. However, in mouse and rat sera, the abovementioned antibodies recognized only the MMW isomer. These mAbs also recognized adiponectin in various human tissues, such as lung, kidney, and adipose tissues, although the three mAbs had different staining intensities. The mAb from clone KH4-8 effectively inhibited increases in interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 expression in recombinant adiponectin-stimulated human osteoblasts and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Also, the mAbs KH7-33 and KH4-8 significantly ameliorated rheumatic symptoms in a collagen-induced arthritis mouse model. This result suggests that these mAb treatments may ameliorate adiponectin-mediated inflammatory response. mAbs against human adiponectin isomers can potentially be developed as therapeutic antibodies to target specific detrimental isoforms of adiponectin while maintaining the functions of beneficial isoforms.",

    "title": "Leptin in depression: a potential therapeutic target.",
    "abstract": "Leptin, produced and secreted by white adipose tissue, plays a critical role in regulating body weight, food intake, and energy metabolism. Recently, several studies have identified an underlying role for leptin in regulation of mood and cognition via regulation of synaptic changes in the brain that have been associated with antidepressant-like actions. Brain neural plasticity occurs in response to a range of intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli, including those that may mediate the effects of antidepressants. Neural plasticity theories of depression are thought to explain multiple aspects of depression and the effects of antidepressants. It is also well documented that leptin has effects on neural plasticity. This review summarizes the recent literature on the role of leptin in neural plasticity in order to elaborate the possible mechanism of leptin's antidepressant-like effects. Recent findings provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms of neural plasticity in depression. Leptin may influence these mechanisms and consequently constitute a possible target for novel therapeutic approaches to the treatment of depression.",

    "title": "A role for calcium in resistin transcriptional activation in diabetic hearts.",
    "abstract": "The adipokine resistin has been proposed to link obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes. We have previously reported that diabetic hearts express high levels of resistin while overexpression of resistin in adult rat hearts gives rise to a phenotype resembling diabetic cardiomyopathy. The transcriptional regulation of resistin in diabetic cardiac tissue is currently unknown. This study investigated the mechanism of resistin upregulation and the role of Serca2a in its transcriptional suppression. We demonstrate that restoration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in diabetic hearts, through normalization of Serca2a function genetically and pharmacologically, suppressed resistin expression via inhibition of NFATc. H9c2 myocytes stimulated with high-glucose concentration or Ca<sup>2+</sup> time-dependently increased NFATc and resistin expression while addition of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator BAPTA-AM attenuated this effect. NFATc expression was enhanced in hearts from ob/ob diabetic and from cardiac-specific Serca2a<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Similarly, NFATc increased resistin expression in myocytes cultured in low glucose while the NFATc inhibitor VIVIT blocked glucose-induced resistin expression, suggesting that hyperglycemia/diabetes induces resistin expression possibly through NFATc activation. Interestingly, overexpression of Serca2a or VIVIT mitigated glucose-stimulated resistin and NFATc expression and enhanced AMPK activity, a downstream target of resistin signaling. NFATc direct activation of resistin was verified by resistin promoter luciferase activity and chromatin-immunoprecipitation analysis. Interestingly, activation of Serca2a by a novel agonist, CDN1163, mirrored the effects of AAV9-Serca2a gene transfer on resistin expression and its promoter activity and AMPK signaling in diabetic mice. These findings parse a role for Ca<sup>2+</sup> in resistin transactivation and provide support that manipulation of Serca2a-NFATc-Resistin axis might be useful in hyper-resistinemic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin is an adipocytokine with insulin-sensitizing, anti-inflammatory, anti-atherosclerotic, and anti-aging properties. Compounds with the ability to promote adiponectin secretion are of interest for the development of anti-aging drugs to improve skin-aging phenotypes. In the phenotypic assay to measure adiponectin secretion during adipogenesis in human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAT-MSCs), kojyl cinnamate ester derivatives increased adiponectin secretion. A target identification study showed that the kojyl cinnamate ester derivatives competitively bound to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x3b1;/&#x3b3; (PPAR&#x3b1;/&#x3b3;). The upregulation of adiponectin production induced by kojyl cinnamate ester derivatives was significantly correlated with PPAR&#x3b1; and PPAR&#x3b3; binding activities. Kojyl cinnamate ester derivatives significantly increased the transcription of genes encoding cholesterol and fatty acid synthesizing enzymes in hAT-MSCs. Notably, the kojyl cinnamate esters upregulated the gene transcription of lipid metabolic enzymes in human epidermal keratinocytes, which are important in the integrity of skin permeability barrier. In addition, the kojyl cinnamate esters that function as PPAR&#x3b1;/&#x3b3; dual modulators inhibited ultraviolet B irradiation-induced inflammation in human epidermal keratinocytes. Therefore, kojyl cinnamate ester derivatives are a novel class of PPAR&#x3b1;/&#x3b3; dual agonists with the potential to improve skin-aging phenotypes.",

    "title": "Pro-inflammatory cytokines: The link between obesity and osteoarthritis.",
    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA), characterized by joint malfunction and chronic disability, is the most common form of arthritis. Clinical and animal experiments reveal that age-related OA is associated with many factors such as age, sex, trauma, and obesity. One of the most influential and modifiable risk factors is obesity. Obesity not only increases mechanical stress on the tibiofemoral cartilage, but also leads to a higher prevalence of OA in non-weight-bearing areas. There is a link between obesity and inflammation. Adipose tissues play a crucial role in this context because they are the major source of cytokines, chemokines, and metabolically-active mediators named adipokines. The adipokines, including adiponectin and leptin, have been demonstrated to regulate inflammatory immune responses in cartilage. Obese people and animals show a higher level of serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#x3b1;), interleukin-1 beta (IL)-1&#x3b2; and IL-6, all of which are produced by macrophages derived from adipose tissue. These pro-inflammatory cytokines regulate the proliferation and apoptosis of adipocytes, promote lipolysis, inhibit lipid synthesis and decrease blood lipids through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. Elevated levels of TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-1 and IL-6&#x2009;have been found in the synovial fluid, synovial membrane, subchondral bone and cartilage of OA patients, confirming their important roles in OA pathogenesis. TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-6 and IL-1 are the factors released by fat to negatively regulate cartilage directly. Moreover, TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-1 and IL-6 can induce the production of other cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and prostaglandins and inhibit the synthesis of proteoglycans and type II collagen; thus, they play a pivotal role in cartilage matrix degradation and bone resorption in OA. Activated chondrocytes also produce MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-13, and aggrecanase 1 and 2 (ADAMTS-4, ADAMTS-5). In addition, IL-1, TNF-&#x3b1; and IL-6 may cause OA indirectly by regulating release of adiponectin and leptin from adipocytes. In this review, we first summarize the relationship between obesity and inflammation. Then we summarize the roles of IL-1, TNF-&#x3b1; and IL-6 in OA. We further discuss how IL-1, TNF-&#x3b1; and IL-6 regulate the communication between fat and OA, and their pathological roles in obesity-related OA. Lastly, we discuss the possibility of using the pro-inflammatory signaling pathway as a therapeutic target to develop drugs for obesity-related OA.",

Areas covered: In this review, we focus on the role of leptin, adiponectin, autotaxin, and interleukin-6 in breast cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and drug response. Furthermore, we investigated adipokines as potential targets of breast cancer-specific drugs. Expert opinion: Adipokines and adipokine receptors are deregulated in breast cancer. Adipokines play various roles in breast cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and drug response, hence, adipokine signaling could be an effective drug target. Several clinical trials are in progress to test the efficacy of adipokine targeting agents. However, adipokines also affect metabolic homeostasis; hence, the adverse effects of the targeted drug should be investigated and addressed.",

    "abstract": "miRNA has been known to regulate diverse cellular and molecular functions. In the earlier study, we have reported that adipocytes differentiated from human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) on 72-h chronic insulin (CI) treatment exhibit insulin resistance (IR). Present study has further explored above model to investigate the role of early expressed miRNAs within human adipocytes to modulate differential adipokine expression as observed during IR. Our results highlight that miR-876-3p regulate glucose homeostasis and its dysregulation leads to IR. We found that miR-876-3p level is a critical determinant of adiponectin expression by virtue of its target within adiponectin 3&#x2032;UTR. Regulatory effect of miR-876-3p impacts crosstalk between adiponectin and insulin signaling. Rosiglitazone treatment in CI-induced IR adipocytes drastically reduced miR-876-3p expression and increased adiponectin level. In line with this, lentiviral-mediated inhibition of miR-876-3p expression ameliorated CI and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced IR in adipocytes differentiated from hMSC and C57BL/6 mice, respectively. Our findings thus suggest that modulating miR-876-3p expression could provide novel opportunities for therapeutic intervention of obesity-associated metabolic syndrome.",

Apart from inflammation, lipotoxicity, and hemodynamic factors, adipokines have been proposed to play crucial roles in the relationship between kidney diseases and metabolic disorders. As one of the key adipokines, fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), which is mainly expressed in adipocytes and macrophages, has recently been shown to be associated with renal dysfunction and kidney damage. Both clinical and experimental studies have proposed circulating FABP4 as a novel predictor for renal injuries, and it might also be a predictor for cardiovascular events in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD). FABP4 has also been detected in the glomerular cells and epithelial tubular cells in mouse and human kidneys, and the expression of FABP4 in these cells has been involved in the pathogenesis of kidney diseases. In addition, experimental studies suggested that inhibition of FABP4 had protective effects on renal damage. Here, we reviewed current knowledge regarding the role of FABP4 in pathophysiological insights as well as its potential function as a predictor and therapeutic target for kidney diseases.",

    "abstract": "Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), the adipose tissue that surrounds most of the vasculature, has emerged as an active component of the blood vessel wall regulating vascular homeostasis and affecting the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Although PVAT characteristics resemble both brown and white adipose tissues, recent evidence suggests that PVAT develops from its own distinct precursors implying a closer link between PVAT and vascular system. Under physiological conditions, PVAT has potent anti-atherogenic properties mediated by its ability to secrete various biologically active factors that induce non-shivering thermogenesis and metabolize fatty acids. In contrast, under pathological conditions (mainly obesity), PVAT becomes dysfunctional, loses its thermogenic capacity and secretes pro-inflammatory adipokines that induce endothelial dysfunction and infiltration of inflammatory cells, promoting atherosclerosis development. Since PVAT plays crucial roles in regulating key steps of atherosclerosis development, it may constitute a novel therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis. Here, we review the current literature regarding the roles of PVAT in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.",

Knockdown of the pore-forming subunit of the R-type (CaV2.3 or Cacna1e) conductance in hypothalamic POMC neurons prevented sustained leptin-induced depolarization. In&#xa0;vivo POMC-specific Cacna1e knockdown increased hepatic glucose production and insulin resistance, while body weight, feeding, or leptin-induced suppression of food intake were not changed.

Regardless of etiology, the profound impact of the degree of liver fibrosis on the prognosis of chronic liver diseases has been well demonstrated. While disease-specific therapy, such as treatments for viral hepatitis, has been shown to reverse liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in both clinical trials and real-life practice, subsets of patients do not demonstrate fibrosis regression. Moreover, where disease-specific therapies are not available, the need for antifibrotics exists. Increased understanding into the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis sets the stage to focus on antifibrotic therapies attempting to: (1) Minimize liver injury and inflammation; (2) Inhibit liver fibrogenesis by enhancing or inhibiting target receptor-ligand interactions or intracellular signaling pathways; and (3) Promote fibrosis resolution. While no antifibrotic therapies are currently available, a number are now being evaluated in clinical trials, and their use is becoming closer to reality for select subsets of patients.",

Diabetes is associated with a substantially lower number of sympathetic nerve terminal endings in the BM; thus, diabetic neuropathy plays a critical role in BM dysfunction. Treatment with mesenchymal stem cells, BM mononuclear cells, haematopoietic stem cells, and stromal cells ameliorates the dysfunction of diabetic neuropathy, which occurs, in part, through secreted neurotrophic factors, growth factors, adipokines, and polarizing macrophage M2 cells and inhibiting inflammation. Inflammation may be a therapeutic target for BM stem cells to improve diabetic neuropathy.

    "abstract": "There is a growing body of studies that show the important role of NS3 protein from hepatitis C virus in fibrosis. However, mechanisms of the effects of this protein on immune modulation of stellate cells remain to be investigated. Herein, the effect of NS3 protein on the expression level of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)1/3 and interleukin-24 (IL-24)-related genes was investigated in hepatic stellate cell (HSC), LX-2. Recombinant NS3 protein was added to LX-2 HSC culture. Leptin and standard medium treatments were also included in experiments as positive and negative controls, respectively. Total RNA was extracted from each well at 6, 12, and 24&#x2009;h after NS3 addition. The expression levels of the fibrotic (transforming growth factor beta 1 [TGF-&#x3b2;], alpha-smooth muscle actin [&#x3b1;-SMA], and COL1A1), inflammatory (IL-6 and IL-24), IL-20R, IL-22R, and immunosuppressive genes (SOCS1 and SOCS3) were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Recombinant NS3 protein induced activated phenotypes of LX-2 with a significant increase in the expression level of &#x3b1;-SMA COL1A1 (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001) and TGF-&#x3b2;. Moreover, this exposure led to a meaningful elevation in the expression of IL-6. Furthermore, compared with leptin (control), after the stellate cell treatment with NS3, SOCS1 and SOCS3 gene expression induced at a comparable level. Compared with the control sample, the NS3 protein significantly increased the expression level of IL-24 and its related receptors, IL-20R and IL-22R. This study not only confirmed the previously proved inflammatory and fibrotic effect of this protein but also indicated that high expression levels of SOCS1, SOCS3, and IL-24 have a significant effect on HSC activation. Therefore, these two molecules can be used as a potential therapeutic target candidate.",

    "title": "Platycodin D May Improve Acne and Prevent Scarring by Downregulating SREBP-1 Expression Via Inhibition of IGF-1R/PI3K/Akt Pathway and Modulating Inflammation with an Increase in Collagen.",
    "abstract": "Although many therapeutic agents have been developed, only a few drugs are known to target multiple pathogenic factors in the treatment of acne. The purpose of this study was to identify a new drug candidate, platycodin D, which is a substance extracted from the root of Platycodon grandiflorum. Using western blotting and Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, we studied the effects of platycodin D on SEB-1 sebocytes, fibroblasts, and keratinocytes. We investigated its effects in view of lipogenesis, collagen production, anti-inflammatory activity, and dyskeratinization. In SEB-1 sebocytes, platycodin D showed a sebosuppressive effect by downregulating ERK and insulin- like growth factor-1R/PI3K/Akt/sterol-regulatory element binding protein-1 signaling pathways. In addition, adiponectin, one of the adipokines responsible for sebum production, was decreased in platycodin D-treated SEB-1 sebocytes. In fibroblasts, platycodin D increased collagen production and reduced inflammation by inhibiting nuclear factor kappa B and matrix metalloproteinases. Platycodin D also showed anti-inflammatory effects on keratinocytes. It also suppressed keratin 16 expression induced by lipopolysaccharide. Furthermore, platycodin D showed no cytotoxicity on both SEB-1 sebocytes and fibroblasts. Our data demonstrate the clinical feasibility of platycodin D for acne treatment and the prevention of acne scarring by sebosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects, as well as through an increase in collagen levels.",

    "title": "Oestradiol and leptin have separate but additive anorexigenic effects and differentially target fat mass in rats.",
    "abstract": "We recently showed that male rats exhibit lower hypophagia and body weight loss compared to female rats following central leptin delivery, suggesting a role for oestradiol in leptin responsiveness. Accordingly, we delivered Ob (leptin) or GFP (control) gene into the brain of male rats that were simultaneously treated with oestradiol or vehicle. In a reciprocal approach, we compared oestradiol-deficient (OVX) with intact females (sham) that received leptin or control vector. Changes in food intake), body weight and body composition were examined. In males, oestradiol and leptin resulted in lower cumulative food intake (15%) and endpoint body weight (5%), although rats receiving dual treatment (oestradiol-leptin) ate 28% less and weighed 22% less than vehicle-control. Changes in food intake were unique to each treatment, with a rapid decrease in vehicle-leptin followed by gradual renormalisation. By contrast, hypophagia in oestradiol-control was of lower amplitude and sporadic. Leptin selectively targeted fat mass and endpoint abdominal fat mass was 65%-80% lower compared to their respective control groups. In females, both leptin groups had lower body weight (endpoint values 20% lower than control groups) with the highest extent in sham animals (endpoint value was 28% less in sham-leptin than in sham-control). OVX rats rapidly started regaining their lost body weight reminiscent of the pattern in males. Leptin rapidly and robustly reduced fat mass with endpoint values 30%-35% less than control treated animals. It appears that leptin and oestradiol decreased food intake and body weight via different mechanisms, with the pattern of oestradiol-leptin being reminiscent of that observed in females and the pattern of OVX-leptin reminiscent of that observed in males. Oestrogen status did not influence initial fat mass loss by leptin. It can be concluded that oestradiol modulates the long-term response to central leptin overexpression, although its actions on energy homeostasis are additive and independent of those of leptin.",

    "title": "Chemerin receptor blockade improves vascular function in diabetic obese mice via redox-sensitive and Akt-dependent pathways.",
    "abstract": "Chemerin and its G protein-coupled receptor [chemerin receptor 23 (ChemR23)] have been associated with endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and insulin resistance. However, the role of chemerin on insulin signaling in the vasculature is still unknown. We aimed to determine whether chemerin reduces vascular insulin signaling and whether there is interplay between chemerin/ChemR23, insulin resistance, and vascular complications associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Molecular and vascular mechanisms were probed in mesenteric arteries and cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from C57BL/6J, nondiabetic lean db/m, and diabetic obese db/db mice as well as in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs). Chemerin decreased insulin-induced vasodilatation in C57BL/6J mice, an effect prevented by CCX832 (ChemR23 antagonist) treatment. In VSMCs, chemerin, via oxidative stress- and ChemR23-dependent mechanisms, decreased insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation, glucose transporter 4 translocation to the membrane, and glucose uptake. In HMECs, chemerin decreased insulin-activated nitric oxide signaling. AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation was reduced by chemerin in both HMECs and VSMCs. CCX832 treatment of db/db mice decreased body weight, insulin, and glucose levels as well as vascular oxidative stress. CCX832 also partially restored vascular insulin responses in db/db and high-fat diet-fed mice. Our novel in vivo findings highlight chemerin/ChemR23 as a promising therapeutic target to limit insulin resistance and vascular complications associated with obesity-related diabetes. NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY Our novel findings show that the chemerin/chemerin receptor 23 axis plays a critical role in diabetes-associated vascular oxidative stress and altered insulin signaling. Targeting chemerin/chemerin receptor 23 may be an attractive strategy to improve insulin signaling and vascular function in obesity-associated diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial biogenesis deficits in neuronal cells are associated with the pathological progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Resistin, a secretory adipocytokine, possesses multiple physiological functions in diverse cells and tissues. However, the effects of resistin on mitochondrial biogenesis in neuronal cells are still elusive. In the current study, we found that resistin caused a sustainable decrease in mitochondrial contents, including mitochondrial DNA/nuclear DNA ratio (mtDNA/nDNA), mitochondrial mass, cytochrome b protein expression, and cytochrome c oxidase activity, which were correlated with loss of mitochondrial function including reduced mitochondrial respiration rate and ATP production in human SH-SY5Y neuronal cells. Indeed, resistin treatment destroyed the expression of peroxisome proliferator activator receptor gamma-coactivator 1&#x3b1; (PGC-1&#x3b1;), a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, as well as its downstream target genes including nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). Notably, overexpression of PGC-1&#x3b1; could completely rescue mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial deficits induced by resistin. Mechanistically, inhibition of 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was shown to mediate the inhibitory effects of resistin on mitochondrial biogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The renin-angiotensin system modulates insulin action. Angiotensin type 1 receptor exerts a deleterious effect, whereas the angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT2R) appears to have beneficial effects providing protection against insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. To further explore the role of the AT2R on insulin action and glucose homeostasis, in this study we administered C57Bl/6 mice with the synthetic agonist of the AT2R C21 for 12&#xa0;weeks (1&#xa0;mg/kg per day; ip). Vehicle-treated animals were used as control. Metabolic parameters, glucose, and insulin tolerance, in&#xa0;vivo insulin signaling in main insulin-target tissues as well as adipose tissue levels of adiponectin, and TNF-&#x3b1; were assessed. C21-treated animals displayed decreased glycemia together with unaltered insulinemia, increased insulin sensitivity, and increased glucose tolerance compared to nontreated controls. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in adipocytes size in epididymal adipose tissue and significant increases in both adiponectin and UCP-1 expression in this tissue. C21-treated mice showed an increase in both basal Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels in the liver, and increased insulin-stimulated Akt activation in adipose tissue. This positive modulation of insulin action induced by C21 appeared not to involve the insulin receptor. In C21-treated mice, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle became unresponsive to insulin in terms of ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels. Present data show that chronic pharmacological activation of AT2R with C21 increases insulin sensitivity in mice and indicate that the AT2R has a physiological role in the conservation of insulin action.",

    "title": "Role of Adiponectin in Central Nervous System Disorders.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin, the most abundant plasma adipokine, plays an important role in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. Adiponectin also possesses insulin-sensitizing, anti-inflammatory, angiogenic, and vasodilatory properties which may influence central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Although initially not thought to cross the blood-brain barrier, adiponectin enters the brain through peripheral circulation. In the brain, adiponectin signaling through its receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, directly influences important brain functions such as energy homeostasis, hippocampal neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. Overall, based on its central and peripheral actions, recent evidence indicates that adiponectin has neuroprotective, antiatherogenic, and antidepressant effects. However, these findings are not without controversy as human observational studies report differing correlations between plasma adiponectin levels and incidence of CNS disorders. Despite these controversies, adiponectin is gaining attention as a potential therapeutic target for diverse CNS disorders, such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease, anxiety, and depression. Evidence regarding the emerging role for adiponectin in these disorders is discussed in the current review.",

    "title": "Rodent models of leptin receptor deficiency are less sensitive to amylin.",
    "abstract": "The pancreatic hormone amylin is released from beta cells following nutrient ingestion and contributes to the control of body weight and glucose homeostasis. Amylin reduces food intake by activating neurons in the area postrema (AP). Amylin was also shown to synergize with the adipokine leptin, with combination therapy producing greater weight loss and food intake reduction than either hormone alone. Although amylin and leptin were initially thought to interact downstream of the AP in the hypothalamus, recent findings show that the two hormones can act on the same AP neurons, suggesting a more direct relationship. The objective of this study was to determine whether amylin action depends on functional leptin signaling. We tested the ability of amylin to induce satiation and to activate its primary target neurons in the AP in two rodent models of LepR deficiency, the db/db mouse and the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat. When compared with wild-type (WT) mice, db/db mice exhibited reduced amylin-induced satiation, reduced amylin-induced Fos in the AP, and a lower expression of calcitonin receptor (CTR) protein, the core component of all amylin receptors. ZDF rats also showed no reduction in food intake following amylin treatment; however, unlike the db/db mice, levels of amylin-induced Fos and CTR in the AP were no different than WT rats. Our results suggest that LepR expression is required for the full anorexic effect of amylin; however, the neuronal activation in the AP seems to depend on the type of LepR mutation.",

    "abstract": "Major depression is a psychiatric disorder with complex etiology. About 30% of depressive patients are resistant to antidepressants that are currently available, likely because they only target the monoaminergic systems. Thus, identification of novel antidepressants with a larger action spectrum is urgently required. Epidemiological data indicate high comorbidity between metabolic and psychiatric disorders, particularly obesity and depression. We used a well-characterized anxiety/depressive-like mouse model consisting of continuous input of corticosterone for seven consecutive weeks. A panel of reliable behavioral tests were conducted to assessing numerous facets of the depression-like state, including anxiety, resignation, reduced motivation, loss of pleasure, and social withdrawal. Furthermore, metabolic features including weight, adiposity, and plasma biological parameters (lipids, adipokines, and cytokines) were investigated in corticosterone-treated mice. Our data show that chronic administration of corticosterone induced the parallel onset of metabolic and behavioral dysfunctions in mice. AdipoRon, a potent adiponectin receptor agonist, prevented the corticosterone-induced early onset of moderate obesity and metabolic syndromes. Moreover, in all the behavioral tests, daily treatment with AdipoRon successfully reversed the corticosterone-induced depression-like state in mice. AdipoRon exerted its pleiotropic actions on various systems including hippocampal neurogenesis, serotonergic neurotransmission, neuroinflammation, and the tryptophan metabolic pathway, which can explain its antidepressant properties. Our study highlights the pivotal role of the adiponergic system in the development of both metabolic and psychiatric disorders. AdipoRon may constitute a promising novel antidepressant.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotics lead to increased susceptibility to colonization by pathogenic organisms, with different effects on the host-microbiota relationship. Here, we show that metronidazole treatment of specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice results in a significant increase of the bacterial phylum Proteobacteria in fecal pellets. Furthermore, metronidazole in SPF mice decreases hind limb muscle weight and results in smaller fibers in the tibialis anterior muscle. In the gastrocnemius muscle, metronidazole causes upregulation of Hdac4, myogenin, MuRF1, and atrogin1, which are implicated in skeletal muscle neurogenic atrophy. Metronidazole in SPF mice also upregulates skeletal muscle FoxO3, described as involved in apoptosis and muscle regeneration. Of note, alteration of the gut microbiota results in increased expression of the muscle core clock and effector genes Cry2, Ror-&#x3b2;, and E4BP4. PPAR&#x3b3; and one of its important target genes, adiponectin, are also upregulated by metronidazole. Metronidazole in germ-free (GF) mice increases the expression of other core clock genes, such as Bmal1 and Per2, as well as the metabolic regulators FoxO1 and Pdk4, suggesting a microbiota-independent pharmacologic effect. In conclusion, metronidazole in SPF mice results in skeletal muscle atrophy and changes the expression of genes involved in the muscle peripheral circadian rhythm machinery and metabolic regulation.",

    "abstract": "Adipose tissue-derived adiponectin has pleiotropic protective effects with suppression of inflammatory and metabolic derangements that may result in insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate adiponectin as a diagnostic marker of T2DM and diabetes control. Fasting adiponectin, insulin, glucose, and HbA1c were determined in 376 patients with known T2DM and 575 subjects with undiagnosed diabetes but with family history of T2DM. Clinical and anthropometric data were recorded. Subjects were classified on the basis of degree of adiposity, insulin resistance (IR), and achievement of target HbA1c levels. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to examine the diagnostic performance for undiagnosed DM. In undiagnosed subjects, adiponectin was significantly lower in subjects with IR and diabetic subjects compared with those without. The area under the adiponectin ROC curve for diagnosis of DM was 0.740. In known T2DM subjects, those with good control had significantly higher adiponectin (8.6 versus 7.4&#x2009;&#x3bc;g/mL) compared to subjects with poor control. Adiponectin levels are associated with better glycemic control and could be a useful adjunct for screening for IR and T2DM. Therapeutic measures that increase adiponectin levels might be valuable targets for improving diabetes control and decreasing complications.",

    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) can develop in prenatal stages and can be exacerbated by exposure to a postnatal high-fat (HF) diet. We investigated the protective effects of resveratrol on prenatal and postnatal HF diet-induced NAFLD. Male Sprague-Dawley rat offspring were placed in five experimental groups (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;10-12 per group): normal diet (VNF), maternal HF diet (ONF), postnatal HF diet (VHF), and maternal HF diet/postnatal HF diet (OHF). A therapeutic group with resveratrol for maternal HF diet/postnatal HF diet (OHFR) was used for comparison. Resveratrol (50&#xa0;mg/kg/day) was dissolved in drinking water for offspring from post-weaning to postnatal day (PND) 120. We found that HF/HF-induced NAFLD was prevented in adult offspring by the administration of resveratrol. Resveratrol administration mediated a protective effect on rats on HF/HF by regulating lipid metabolism, reducing oxidative stress and apoptosis, restoring nutrient-sensing pathways by increasing Sirt1 and leptin expression, and mediating the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) to decrease angiotensinogen, renin, ACE1, and AT1R levels and increased ACE2, AT2R and MAS1 levels compared to those in the OHF group. Our results suggest that a maternal and post-weaning HF diet increases liver steatosis and apoptosis via the RAS. Resveratrol might serve as a therapeutic target by mediating protective actions against NAFLD in offspring exposed to a combination of maternal and postnatal HF diet.",

    "title": "C1q/TNF-Related Protein 9 Inhibits THP-1 Macrophage Foam Cell Formation by Enhancing Autophagy.",
    "abstract": "During the pathogenesis of early atherosclerosis, lipid-loaded macrophages are involved in plaque development and progression. As a novel adipokine, C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein-9 (CTRP9) has beneficial effects in cardiovascular disease. However, previous reports have not studied whether the formation of macrophage foam cell induced by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) is affected by CTRP9. According to our study, in ox-LDL-induced THP-1 macrophages, CTRP9 could reduce the quantity of lipid droplets, lower the level of cholesteryl ester (CE), promote cholesterol efflux, as well as increase the expression level of the cholesterol transport receptors ATP-binding membrane cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and G1 (ABCG1). In addition, the protein of LC3 II is elevated and that of p62 is decreased in CTRP9-treated foam cells by enhancing autophagy. However, using 3-methyladenine (3-MA) abolished the role of CTRP9 by inhibiting autophagy. Mechanistically, the autophagy-promoting effects of CTRP9 on foam cells was reversed by an AMPK inhibitor, Compound C, which inhibited the signaling pathway of adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). These results show that CTRP9 protects against atherosclerosis by promoting cholesterol efflux to reduce the formation of foam cell in virtue of inducing autophagy in an AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway-dependent manner.",

    "title": "Adipokine Visfatin's Role in Pathogenesis of Diabesity and Related Metabolic Derangements.",
    "abstract": "Visfatin is one of the prominent adipokines secreted by adipose tissue. The level of visfatin increases significantly in persons with obesity owing to increased body mass index (BMI). During obesity, the adipocytes, which populate adipose tissue, undergo hypertrophy and hyperplasia and secrete a number of adipocytokines including visfatin. Visfatin, which also acts as an enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase, is one of the prominent adipokines that influence metabolic homeostasis in the body. Visfatin exists in two forms, extracellular and intracellular, and enacts a multitude of actions. The direct and indirect evidence gathered from in-vitro, in-vivo and clinical studies indicate that visfatin modulates obesity and metabolic syndrome-related pathophysiological activities including enhanced inflammation, angiogenesis, synthesis of NAD mononucleotide, and upregulation of antiapoptotic proteins in a number of cell types. It has been implicated in a number of obesity-related alterations and metabolic derangement such as diabetes, cardiovascular complications and some forms of cancers. In this review, the novel hypothesis about the role of visfatin in diabesity has been proposed which implies recent advances in studies about the pathophysiological roles of visfatin during obesity and chronic high glucose in the circulation. Visfatin at high concentration attracts immune cells and produces chronic inflammation in adipocytes. Additionally, it induces insulin resistance in many tissues and causes pancreatic beta cells dysfunction at later stages. Further, its potential as an important target to develop molecular medicine in diabesity and related metabolic syndrome has been highlighted.",

    "abstract": "The C1q/TNF-related peptide 8 (CTRP8) has recently emerged as a novel ligand of the G protein-coupled receptor RXFP1 in the fatal brain tumor glioblastoma (GBM). We previously demonstrated that the CTRP8-RXFP1 ligand-receptor system promotes motility and matrix invasion of patient GBM and U87 MG cells by specific phosphorylation of PI3 kinase and protein kinase C. Here, we demonstrate a novel role for CTRP8 in protecting human GBM cells against the DNA alkylating damage of temozolomide (TMZ), the standard chemotherapy drug used to treat GBM. This DNA protective role of CTRP8 required a functional RXFP1-STAT3 signaling cascade in GBM cells. We identified N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase (MPG), a monofunctional glycosylase that initiates base excision repair pathway by generating an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site, as a new CTRP8-RXFP1-STAT3 target in GBM. Upon TMZ exposure, treatment with CTRP8 reduced the formation of AP sites and double-strand DNA breaks in GBM cells. This CTRP8 effect was independent of cellular MGMT levels and was associated with decreased caspase 3/7 activity and increased survival of human GBM. CTRP8-induced RXFP1 activation caused an increase in cellular protein levels of the anti-apoptotic Bcl members and STAT3 targets Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL in human GBM. Collectively, our results demonstrate a novel multipronged and clinically relevant mechanism by which the CTRP8-RXFP1 ligand-receptor system exerts a DNA protective function against TMZ chemotherapeutic stress in GBM. This CTRP8-RXFP1-STAT3 axis is a novel determinant of TMZ responsiveness/chemoresistance and an emerging new drug target for improved treatment of human GBM.",

    "abstract": "Obesity and associated disorders such as metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes (T2D) have reached epidemic proportions. Several natural products have been reported as Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor (PPAR) agonists, functioning as lead compounds towards developing new anti-diabetic drugs due to adverse side effects of existing PPAR drugs. We recently isolated and identified (7E)-9-oxohexadec-7-enoic acid (1) and (10E)-9-oxohexadec-10-enoic acid (2) from the marine algae Chaetoceros karianus. Herein we report the total synthesis, pharmacological characterization, and biological evaluations of these naturally occurring oxo-fatty acids (oFAs). The syntheses of 1 and 2 afforded sufficient material for extensive biological evaluations. Both oFAs show an appreciable dose-dependent activation of PPAR&#x3b1; and -&#x3b3;, with EC50 values in the micromolar range, and an ability to regulate important PPAR target genes in hepatocytes and adipocytes. Moreover, both 1 and 2 are able to drive adipogenesis when evaluated in the Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) pre-adipocyte cell model, but with lowered expression of adipocyte markers and reduced lipid accumulation compared to the drug rosiglitazone. This seems to be caused by a transient upregulation of PPAR&#x3b3; and C/EBP&#x3b1; expression. Importantly, whole transcriptome analysis shows that both compounds induce anti-diabetic gene programs in adipocytes by upregulating insulin-sensitizing adipokines and repressing pro-inflammatory cytokines.",

    "title": "Adiponectin signaling and its role in bone metabolism.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin, the most prevalent adipo-cytokine in plasma plays critical metabolic and anti-inflammatory roles is fast emerging as an important molecular target for the treatment of metabolic disorders. Adiponectin action is critical in multiple organs including cardio-vascular system, muscle, liver, adipose tissue, brain and bone. Adiponectin signaling in bone has been a topic of active investigation lately. Human association studies and multiple mice models of gene deletion/modification failed to define a clear cause and effect of adiponectin signaling in bone. The most plausible reason could be the multimeric forms of adiponectin that display differential binding to receptors (adipoR1 and adipoR2) with cell-specific receptor variants in bone. Discovery of small molecule agonist of adipoR1 suggested a salutary role of this receptor in bone metabolism. The downstream signaling of adipoR1 in osteoblasts involves stimulation of oxidative phosphorylation leading to increased differentiation via the likely suppression of wnt inhibitor, sclerostin. On the other hand, the inflammation modulatory effect of adiponectin signaling suppresses the RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor &#x3ba;-B ligand) - to - OPG (osteprotegerin) ratio in osteoblasts leading to the suppression of osteoclastogenic response. This review will discuss the adiponectin signaling and its role in skeletal homeostasis and critically assess whether adipoR1 could be a therapeutic target for the treatment of metabolic bone diseases.",

    "abstract": "Vaspin (visceral adipose tissue-derived serine protease inhibitor) was recently identified as a novel adipocytokine with insulin-sensitizing effects. Serum vaspin levels are reported either increased or decreased in patients with coronary artery disease. Our translational research was performed to evaluate the expression of vaspin in human coronary atherosclerotic lesions, and its effects on atherogenic responses in human macrophages and human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC), as well as aortic atherosclerotic lesion development in spontaneously hyperlipidemic Apoe<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice, an animal model of atherosclerosis. Vaspin was expressed at high levels in macrophages/vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) within human coronary atheromatous plaques. Vaspin significantly suppressed inflammatory phenotypes with nuclear factor &#x3ba;B down-regulation in human macrophages. Vaspin significantly suppressed oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced foam cell formation with CD36 and acyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase-1 down-regulation and ATP-binding cassette transporters A1 and G1, and scavenger receptor class B type 1 up-regulation in human macrophages. Vaspin significantly suppressed angiotensin II-induced migration and proliferation with ERK1/2 and JNK down-regulation, and increased collagen production with phosphoinositide 3-kinase and Akt up-regulation in HASMCs. Chronic infusion of vaspin into Apoe<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice significantly suppressed the development of aortic atherosclerotic lesions, with significant reductions of intraplaque inflammation and the macrophage/VSMC ratio, a marker of plaque instability. Our study indicates that vaspin prevents atherosclerotic plaque formation and instability, and may serve as a novel therapeutic target in atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "Leptin, an adipokine that is implicated in the control of food intake via appetite suppression, may also stimulate oxidative stress, inflammation, thrombosis, arterial stiffness, angiogenesis and atherogenesis. These leptin-induced effects may predispose to the development of cardiovascular diseases. In the present review we discuss the evidence linking leptin levels with the presence, severity and/or prognosis of both coronary artery disease and non-cardiac vascular diseases such as stroke, carotid artery disease, peripheral artery disease (PAD) and abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) as well as with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Leptin levels have been positively associated with the presence, severity, extent and lesion complexity of coronary atherosclerosis as well as with the presence, severity and poor clinical outcomes of both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. But conflicting results also exist. Furthermore, leptin was reported to independently predict common carotid intima-media thickness and carotid plaque instability. A link between hyperleptinemia and PAD has been reported, whereas limited data were available on the potential association between leptin and AAA. Elevated leptin concentrations have also been related to CKD incidence and progression as well as with insulin resistance, T2DM, micro- and macrovascular diabetic complications. Statins and antidiabetic drugs (including sitagliptin, metformin, pioglitazone, liraglutide and empagliflozin) may affect leptin levels. Further research is needed to establish the potential use (if any) of leptin as a therapeutic target in these diseases.",

Preclinical results indicate that modifying adipose tissue and bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) could be a successful multiple myeloma (MM) therapy. BMAT interrelates with bone marrow cells and other immune cells, and may influence MM disease progression. The BM adipocytes may have a role in MM progression, bone homing, chemoresistance, and relapse, due to local endocrine, paracrine, or metabolic factors. BM adipocytes isolated from MM subjects have been shown to increase myeloma growth in vitro and may preserve cells from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. By producing free fatty acids and emitting signaling molecules such as growth factors and adipokines, BM adipocytes are both an energy font and an endocrine signaling factory. This review should suggest future research approaches toward developing novel treatments to target MM by targeting BMAT and its products.",

    "abstract": "Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the most severe form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and is a serious public health problem around the world. There are currently no approved treatments for NASH. FGF21 has recently emerged as a promising drug candidate for metabolic diseases. However, the disadvantages of FGF21 as a clinically useful medicine include its short plasma half-life and poor drug-like properties. Here, we have explored the effects of PsTag600-FGF21, an engineered long-acting FGF21 fusion protein, in mice with NASH and describe some of the underlying mechanisms. A long-acting FGF21 was prepared by genetic fusion with a 600 residues polypeptide (PsTag600). We used a choline-deficient high-fat diet-induced model of NASH in mice. The effects on body weight, insulin sensitivity, inflammation and levels of hormones and metabolites were studied first. We further investigated whether PsTag600-FGF21 attenuated inflammation through the Th17-IL17A axis and the associated mechanisms. PsTag600-FGF21 dose-dependently reduced body weight, blood glucose, and insulin and lipid levels and reversed hepatic steatosis. PsTag600-FGF21 enhanced fatty acid activation and mitochondrial &#x3b2;-oxidation in the liver. The profound reduction in hepatic inflammation in NASH mice following PsTag600-FGF21 was associated with inhibition of IL17A expression in Th17 cells. Furthermore, PsTag600-FGF21 depended on adiponectin to exert its suppression of Th17 cell differentiation and IL17A expression. Our data have uncovered some of the mechanisms by which PsTag600-FGF21 suppresses hepatic inflammation and further suggest that PsTag600-FGF21 could be an effective approach in NASH treatment.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence indicates that a number of tissues are damaged due to build-up of abnormal amount of Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs) in several diseases including diabetes. Currently AGE inhibitors are scarce in clinical use indicating a need for development of new anti-AGE agents. The aim of the current study is to identify the new AGE inhibitors and to decipher their mechanism of action for alleviating symptoms of diabetes in mice. Among several derivatives, one of the derivatives of indanedione, IDD-24 demonstrated highest inhibition of AGE formation and AGE mediated reactive oxygen species production in HepG-2 and mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In mice treated with IDD-24, reduction in serum AGE formation and expression of Receptor for AGEs (RAGE) was seen in IDD-24 treated db/db mice. In&#xa0;vivo, glycogen synthesis was also increased in muscle tissue. In adipocytes, anti-AGE agent restored AGEs' induced diminished glucose uptake in fat cells. Mice treated with IDD-24 exhibited increased glucose tolerance, increaed serum adiponectin levels and decreased insulin resistance. Deciphering mechanism of IDD-24 in diabetic mice, it was observed that nuclear factor-&#x3ba;B (NF-&#x3ba;B) and serine phosphorylation of Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) declined, while diminished activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) appears to be partly responsible for restoration of insulin signaling. We conclude that IDD-24 can be a possible treatment target to address symptoms of diabetes.",

    "title": "The role of adipokines in skeletal muscle inflammation and insulin sensitivity.",
    "abstract": "There is currently an unmet clinical need to develop better pharmacological treatments to improve glucose handling in Type II Diabetes patients with obesity. To this end, determining the effect of obesity-associated adipokines on skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity has emerged as an important area of drug discovery research. This review draws together the data on the functional role of adipokines on skeletal muscle insulin signalling, highlights several understudied novel adipokines and provides a perspective on the direction of future research. The adipokines leptin, resistin, visfatin and adiponectin have all been shown to affect skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity by impacting on the activity of components within insulin signalling pathways, affecting GLUT4 translocation and modulating insulin-mediated skeletal muscle glucose uptake. Furthermore, proteomic analysis of the adipose tissue secretome has recently identified several novel adipokines including vaspin, chemerin and pref-1 that are associated with obesity and insulin resistance in humans and functionally impact on insulin signalling pathways. However, predominantly, these functional findings are the result of studies in rodents, with in vitro studies utilising either rat L6 or murine C2C12 myoblasts and/or myotubes. Despite the methodology to isolate and culture human myoblasts and to differentiate them into myotubes being established, the use of human muscle in vitro models for the functional validation of adipokines on skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity is limited. Understanding the mechanism of action and function of adipokines in mediating insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle may lead to the development of novel therapeutics for patients with type 2 diabetes. However, to date, studies conducted in human skeletal muscle cells and tissues are limited. Such human in vitro studies should be prioritised in order to reduce the risk of candidate drugs failing in the clinic due to the assumption that rodent skeletal muscle target validation studies will to translate to human.",

In this study, the effects and mechanisms of APN on biological functions of rat vascular endothelial progenitor cells (VEPCs) were investigated in vitro.

It was suggested that APN promoted the optical density (OD) value of VEPCs, enhanced mRNA expression of Bcl-2 and VEGF, and inhibited cell apoptotic rate. Furthermore, protein expression of pSTAT3 was also increased in the presence of APN. Moreover, APN changed-proliferation, apoptosis and VEGF expression of VEPCs were partially suppressed after blocking the mTOR-STAT3 signaling pathway by the mTOR inhibitor XL388.

    "title": "Resistin facilitates VEGF-C-associated lymphangiogenesis by inhibiting miR-186 in human chondrosarcoma cells.",
    "abstract": "Chondrosarcoma is a common primary malignant tumor of the bone that can metastasize through the vascular system to other organs. A key step in the metastatic process, lymphangiogenesis, involves vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C). However, the effects of lymphangiogenesis in chondrosarcoma metastasis remain to be clarified. Accumulating evidence shows that resistin, a cytokine secreted from adipocytes and monocytes, also promotes tumor pathogenesis. Notably, chondrosarcoma can easily metastasize. In this study, we demonstrate that resistin enhances VEGF-C expression and lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs)-associated lymphangiogenesis in human chondrosarcoma cells. We also show that resistin triggers VEGF-C-dependent lymphangiogenesis via the c-Src signaling pathway and down-regulating micro RNA (miR)-186. Overexpression of resistin in chondrosarcoma cells significantly enhanced VEGF-C production and LECs-associated lymphangiogenesis in vitro and tumor-related lymphangiogenesis in vivo. Resistin levels were positively correlated with VEGF-C-dependent lymphangiogenesis via the down-regulation of miR-186 expression in clinical samples from chondrosarcoma tissue. This study is the first to evaluate the mechanism underlying resistin-induced promotion of LECs-associated lymphangiogenesis via the upregulation of VEGF-C expression in human chondrosarcomas. We suggest that resistin may represent a molecular target in VEGF-C-associated tumor lymphangiogenesis in chondrosarcoma metastasis.",

    "title": "Dibenzoylmethane Suppresses Lipid Accumulation and Reactive Oxygen Species Production through Regulation of Nuclear Factor (Erythroid-Derived 2)-Like 2 and Insulin Signaling in Adipocytes.",
    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dibenzoylmethane (1,3-diphenyl-1,3-propanedione, DBM) from licorice roots on lipid accumulation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in 3T3-L1 cells. DBM effectively inhibited lipid accumulation during adipogenesis, and its inhibitory effect was shown to be due to the down-regulation of adipogenic factors such as CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein-&#x3b1; (C/EBP&#x3b1;), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x3b3; (PPAR&#x3b3;), and fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4). DBM was observed to exert its inhibitory effect on lipid accumulation in the early adipogenic stage (days 0-2) by regulating early adipogenic factors including CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein-&#x3b2; (C/EBP&#x3b2;) and Krueppel-like factor (KLF) 2. DBM significantly increased the translocation of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2(Nrf2) into the nucleus, promoting the protein expression of its target gene, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). DBM significantly suppressed the insulin-mediated activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (Akt), which are components of insulin signaling. In addition, intracellular ROS production was effectively reduced by DBM treatment, which upregulated antioxidant genes such as glutathione peroxidase (Gpx), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). Furthermore, DBM significantly regulated the expression of the adipokines, resistin and adiponectin. This DBM-mediated regulation of lipid accumulation, ROS production, and adipokine production was shown to be involved in the regulation of the Nrf2 and insulin signaling.",

    "title": "A potential strategy for treating atherosclerosis: improving endothelial function via AMP-activated protein kinase.",
    "abstract": "Endothelial dysfunction is caused by many factors, such as dyslipidemia, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and inflammation. It has been demonstrated that endothelial dysfunction is the initial process of atherosclerosis. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an important metabolic switch that plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and inflammation. However, recent evidence indicates that AMPK could be a target for atherosclerosis by improving endothelial function. For instance, activation of AMPK inhibits the production of reactive oxygen species induced by mitochondrial dysfunction, ER stress, and NADPH oxidase. Moreover, activation of AMPK inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory factors induced by dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia and restrains production of perivascular adipose tissue-released adipokines. AMPK activation prevents endothelial dysfunction by increasing the bioavailability of nitric oxide. Therefore, we focused on the primary risk factors involved in endothelial dysfunction, and summarize the features of AMPK in the protection of endothelial function, by providing signaling pathways thought to be important in the pathological progress of risk factors.",

    "title": "Effect of the anti-IL-17 antibody on allergic inflammation in an obesity-related asthma model.",
    "abstract": "The co-occurrence of obesity aggravates asthma symptoms. Diet-induced obesity increases helper T cell (TH) 17 cell differentiation in adipose tissue and the spleen. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor pravastatin can potentially be used to treat asthma in obese patients by inhibiting interleukin 17 (IL-17) expression. This study investigated the combined effects of pravastatin and anti-IL-17 antibody treatment on allergic inflammation in a mouse model of obesity-related asthma. High-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity was induced in C57BL/6 mice with or without ovalbumin (OVA) sensitization and challenge. Mice were administered the anti-IL-17 antibody, pravastatin, or both, and pathophysiological and immunological responses were analyzed. HFD exacerbated allergic airway inflammation in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of HFD-OVA mice as compared to OVA mice. Blockading of the IL-17 in the HFD-OVA mice decreased airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) and airway inflammation compared to the HFD-OVA mice. Moreover, the administration of the anti-IL-17 antibody decreased the leptin/adiponectin ratio in the HFD-OVA but not the OVA mice. Co-administration of pravastatin and anti-IL-17 inhibited airway inflammation and AHR, decreased goblet cell numbers, and increased adipokine levels in obese asthmatic mice. These results suggest that the IL-17-leptin/adiponectin axis plays a key role in airway inflammation in obesity-related asthma. Our findings suggest a potential new treatment for IL-17 as a target that may benefit obesity-related asthma patients who respond poorly to typical asthma medications.",

    "title": "Fluoxetine Modulates the Activity of Hypothalamic POMC Neurons via mTOR Signaling.",
    "abstract": "Hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons are important players in the regulation of energy homeostasis; we previously demonstrated that environmental stimulation excites arcuate nucleus circuits to undergo plastic remodeling, leading to altered ratio between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic contacts on these neurons. The widely used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (FLX) is known to affect body weight. On the other hand, FLX administration mimics the effects of environmental stimulation on synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and cortex. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is instrumental in these phenomena. Thus, we aimed at investigating whether and how FLX affects POMC neurons activity and hypothalamic mTOR function. Adult mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the POMC promoter were treated with FLX for 3&#xa0;weeks resulting in diminished body weight. Patch clamp recordings performed on POMC neurons indicate that FLX increases their firing rate and the excitatory AMPA-mediated transmission, and reduces the inhibitory GABAergic currents at presynaptic level. Immunofluorescence studies indicate that FLX increases the ratio between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic contacts on POMC neurons. These changes are associated with an increased activity of the hypothalamic mTOR pathway. Use of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin blunts the effects of FLX on body weight and on functional and structural plasticity of POMC neurons. Our findings indicate that FLX is able to remodel POMC neurons, and that this may be partly mediated by the mTOR signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to summarize the effectiveness and safety of metreleptin in patients with congenital or acquired generalized lipodystrophy. Patients (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;66) aged &#x2265;6 months had lipodystrophy, low circulating leptin, and &#x2265;1 metabolic abnormality (diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance, or hypertriglyceridemia). Metreleptin dose (once or twice daily) was titrated to a mean dose of 0.10&#x2009;mg/kg/day with a maximum of 0.24&#x2009;mg/kg/day. Means and changes from baseline to month 12 were assessed for glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting triglycerides (TGs), and fasting plasma glucose (FPG). Additional assessments included the proportions of patients achieving target decreases in HbA1c or fasting TGs at months 4, 12, and 36, medication changes, and estimates of liver size. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were recorded. Significant mean reductions from baseline were seen at month 12 for HbA1c (-2.2%, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;59) and FPG (-3.0&#x2009;mmol/L, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;59) and mean percent change in fasting TGs (-32.1%, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;57) (all p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.001). Reductions from baseline over time in these parameters were also significant at month 36 (all p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;14). At month 4, 34.8% of patients had a &#x2265;1% reduction in HbA1c and 62.5% had a &#x2265;30% reduction in fasting TGs; at month 12, 80% of patients had a &#x2265;1% decrease in HbA1c or &#x2265;30% decrease in TGs, and 66% had a decrease of &#x2265;2% in HbA1c or &#x2265;40% decrease in TGs. Of those on medications, 41%, 22%, and 24% discontinued insulin, oral antidiabetic medications, or lipid-lowering medications, respectively. Mean decrease in liver volume at month 12 was 33.8% (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;12). Most TEAEs were of mild/moderate severity. In patients with generalized lipodystrophy, long-term treatment with metreleptin was well tolerated and resulted in sustained improvements in hypertriglyceridemia, glycemic control, and liver volume.",

    "title": "Adipokine RBP4 drives ovarian cancer cell migration.",
    "abstract": "Obesity has been linked to several types of cancers including ovarian cancer. Retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) is an adipokine that drives the development of hyperinsulinemia and type II diabetes in obesity patients and animals. Previously, we have identified RBP4 as a serum marker for ovarian cancer. Here we further explored the consequence of RBP4 upregulation in ovarian cancer cells and its molecular mechanism. Our results show that RBP4 is overexpressed in ovarian cancer cells to the same extent as in adipose tissues. The overexpression of RBP4 in ovarian cancer cells promotes cancer cell migration and proliferation. At molecular level, cancer progression factors MMP2 and MMP9 are induced in response to RBP4 overexpression. We further investigated which signaling pathways are utilized by RBP4 to activate ovarian cancer cell migration. We found RhoA/Rock1 pathway is turned on and CyclinD1 is upregulated in RBP4 overexpressed cells. Inhibition of RhoA/Rock1 pathway reduces the RBP4-induced MMP2 and MMP9 expression. The RBP4 action is depend on its associated ligand vitamin A/retinol acid (RA) and possibly involves similar pathways as for conferring insulin resistance. Moreover, we show that knockdown of RBP4 significantly reduce cancer cell migration and proliferation as well as expressions of oncogenic factors. Our results indicated that RBP4 can drive ovarian cancer cell migration and proliferation via RhoA/Rock1 and ERK pathway. It suggests that RBP4 act as a oncogene in ovarian cancer cells. Thus, RBP4 could be a molecular bridge between obesity and cancers and a potential target for treating obese cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "There is a need for novel treatment approaches in anorexia nervosa (AN). While there is broad knowledge with regard to altered appetite regulation and neuropsychological deficits in AN patients on the one hand, and the effects of estrogen replacement upon neuropsychological performance in healthy subjects on the other, up to now, no study has implemented estrogen replacement in AN patients, in order to examine its effects upon AN-associated and general psychopathology, neuropsychological performance and concentrations of peptide components of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and within appetite-regulating circuits. This is a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial on the effects of a 10-week oral estrogen replacement (combination of ethinyl estradiol 0.03&#xa0;mg and dienogest 2&#xa0;mg) in adult female AN patients. The primary target is the assessment of the impact of sex hormone replacement upon neuropsychological performance by means of a neuropsychological test battery consisting of a test for verbal intelligence, the Trail making test A and B, a Go/No-go paradigm with food cues and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. Secondary targets include a) the examination of safety and tolerability (as mirrored by the number of adverse events), b) assessments of the impact upon eating disorder-specific psychopathology by means of the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) and the Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (EDI-2), c) the influence upon anxiety using the State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory (STAI), d) assessments of plasma cortisol levels during a dexamethasone-suppression test and appetite-regulating plasma peptides (ghrelin, leptin, insulin, glucose) during an oral glucose tolerance test and, e) a possible impact upon the prescription of antidepressants. This is the first study of its kind. There are no evidence-based psychopharmacological options for the treatment of AN. Thus, the results of this clinical trial may have a relevant impact on future treatment regimens. Novel approaches are necessary to improve rates of AN symptom remission and increase the rapidity of treatment response. Identifying the underlying biological (e.g. neuroendocrinological) factors that maintain AN or may predict patient treatment response represent critical future research directions. Continued efforts to incorporate novel pharmacological aspects into treatments will increase access to evidence-based care and help reduce the burden of AN.

    "abstract": "Zinc-&#x3b1;2-glycoprotein (ZAG) is a 42-kDa protein reported as an anti-inflammatory adipocytokine. Evidences from clinical and experimental studies revealed that brain inflammation plays important roles in epileptogenesis and seizure. Interestingly, closely relationship between ZAG and many important inflammatory mediators has been proven. Our previous study identified ZAG in neurons and found that ZAG is decreased in epilepsy and interacts with TGF&#x3b2; and ERK. This study aimed to investigate the role of ZAG in seizure and explore its effect on seizure-related neuroinflammation. We overexpressed AZGP1 in the hippocampus of rats via adeno-associated virus vector injection and observed their seizure behavior and EEG after pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) kindling. The level of typical inflammation mediators including TNF&#x3b1;, IL-6, TGF&#x3b2;, ERK, and ERK phosphorylation were determined. The overexpression of AZGP1 reduced the seizure severity, prolonged the latency of kindling, and alleviated epileptiform discharges in EEG changes induced by PTZ. Overexpression of AZGP1 also suppressed the expression of TNF&#x3b1;, IL-6, TGF&#x3b2;, and ERK phosphorylaton in PTZ-kindled rats. ZAG may inhibit TGF&#x3b2;-mediated ERK phosphorylation and inhibit neuroinflammation mediated by TNF&#x3b1; and IL-6, suggesting ZAG may suppress seizure via inhibiting neuroinflammation. ZAG may be a potential and novel therapeutic target for epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Restenosis is a pathologic re-narrowing of a coronary artery lesion after mechanical injury. Its pathophysiological mechanisms have not been fully elucidated at present, but are thought to include inflammation, vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation, and matrix remodeling, beginning with insufficient endothelium healing. Restenosis presents with angina symptoms or acute coronary syndromes and lead to a revascularization, either with coronary artery bypass or repeat percutaneous coronary intervention. Some studies have reported that hypoadiponectinemia has been an independent risk factor for the onset of acute coronary syndromes and restenosis. Accumulating evidence shows that low concentrations of adiponectin may be involved in impairing endothelium functions, inflammation, and VSMC proliferation that lead to restenosis. Preclinical studies have proven that adiponectin promotes endothelium healing, effectively inhibits inflammation, and maintains contractile phenotypes of VSMCs, indicating that it may be developed as a new therapeutic target for the treatment of restenosis.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin is an important adipocyte-derived plasma protein that has beneficial effects on cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases. A low level of plasma Adiponectin is associated with increased mortality post ischemic stroke; however, little is known about the causal role of Adiponectin as well as its molecular mechanisms in neonatal hypoxia ischemia (HI). In the present study, ten-day-old rat pups were subjected to right common carotid artery ligation followed by 2.5&#x202f;h hypoxia. Recombinant human Adiponectin (rh-Adiponectin) was administered intranasally 1&#x202f;h post HI. Adiponectin Receptor 1 (AdipoR1) siRNA, APPL1 siRNA, LKB1 siRNA were administered through intracerebroventricular injection 48&#x202f;h before HI. Brain infarct area measurement, neurological function test, western blot, Fluoro Jade C (FJC), TUNEL, and immunofluorescence staining were conducted. Results revealed that endogenous Adiponectin, AdipoR1 and APPL1 were increased in a time dependent manner after HI. Administration of rh-Adiponectin reduced brain infarct area, neuronal apoptosis, brain atrophy and improved neurological function at 24&#x202f;h and 4 weeks post HI. Furthermore, rh-Adiponectin treatment increased Adiponectin, AdipoR1, APPL1, cytosolic LKB1, p-AMPK expression levels and thereby attenuated apoptosis as shown by the decreased expression of the pro-apoptotic marker, Cleaved Caspase 3 (C-Cas3), as well as the number of FJC and TUNEL positively stained neurons. AdipoR1, APPL1 and LKB1 siRNAs abolished the anti-apoptotic effects of rh-Adiponectin at 24&#x202f;h after HI. Collectively, the data provided evidence that intranasal administration of rh-Adiponectin attenuated neuronal apoptosis at least in part via activating AdipoR1/APPL1/LKB1/AMPK signaling pathway. Adiponectin could represent a therapeutic target for treatment of neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy.",

    "title": "Good, Bad, or Ugly: the Biological Roles of Bone Marrow Fat.",
    "abstract": "Bone marrow fat expresses mixed characteristics, which could correspond to white, brown, and beige types of fat. Marrow fat could act as either energy storing and adipokine secreting white fat or as a source of energy for hematopoiesis and bone metabolism, thus acting as brown fat. However, there is also a negative interaction between marrow fat and other elements of the bone marrow milieu, which is known as lipotoxicity. In this review, we will describe the good and bad roles of marrow fat in the bone, while focusing on the specific components of the negative effect of marrow fat on bone metabolism. Lipotoxicity in the bone is exerted by bone marrow fat through the secretion of adipokines and free fatty acids (FFA) (predominantly palmitate). High levels of FFA found in the bone marrow of aged and osteoporotic bone are associated with decreased osteoblastogenesis and bone formation, decreased hematopoiesis, and increased osteoclastogenesis. In addition, FFA such as palmitate and stearate induce apoptosis and dysfunctional autophagy in the osteoblasts, thus affecting their differentiation and function. Regulation of marrow fat could become a therapeutic target for osteoporosis. Inhibition of the synthesis of FFA by marrow fat could facilitate osteoblastogenesis and bone formation while affecting osteoclastogenesis. However, further studies testing this hypothesis are still required.",

    "title": "Adiponectin aggravates bone erosion by promoting osteopontin production in synovial tissue of rheumatoid arthritis.",
    "abstract": "We have previously reported that adiponectin (AD), an adipokine that is secreted by adipocytes, correlates well with progressive bone erosion in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The exact mechanism of AD in promoting joint destruction remains unclear. Osteopontin (OPN) is required for osteoclast recruitment. We hypothesized that AD exacerbates bone erosion by inducing OPN expression in synovial tissue. This study aimed to evaluate a novel role for AD in RA. The serum levels of AD and OPN were determined in 38 patients with RA, 40 patients with osteoarthritis (OA), and 20 healthy controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). AD and OPN production were measured by double immunofluorescence in RA and OA synovial tissue. Quantitative real-time PCR and immunofluorescence were used to evaluate the mRNA and protein expression levels of OPN in RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) and OA synovial fibroblasts after pre-incubation with AD, respectively. Migration of the RAW264.7 osteoclast precursor cell line was assessed using the Transwell migration assay and co-culture system. Bone destruction and osteoclastogenesis were assessed by immunohistochemical staining, microcomputed tomography and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining in AD-treated collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice with or without OPN silencing. The expression levels of OPN and integrin &#x3b1;v&#x3b2;3 in the ankle joint tissues of the mice were examined by double immunofluorescence. Our results indicated that the AD and OPN expression levels increased noticeably and were associated with each other in the RA serum. The AD distribution was coincident with that of OPN in the RA synovial tissue. AD stimulation of RASFs increased OPN production in a dose-dependent manner. AD-treated RASFs promoted RAW264.7 cell migration, and the effect was blocked with a specific antibody against OPN. Silencing of OPN using lentiviral-OPN short hairpin RNA reduced the number of TRAP-positive osteoclasts and the extent of bone erosion in the AD-treated CIA mice. When bound to integrin &#x3b1;v&#x3b2;3, OPN functions as a mediator of AD and osteoclasts. Our study provides new evidence of AD involvement in bone erosion. AD induces the expression of OPN, which recruits osteoclasts and initiates bone erosion. These data highlight AD as a novel target for RA treatment.",

    "abstract": "The hypothalamus is the regulatory centre of both appetite and energy balance and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the hypothalamus is involved in the pathogenesis of obesity. Recently, inhibition of 11 &#x3b2; hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type1 (11&#x3b2;-HSD1) was reported to have an anti-obesity effect by reducing fat mass. However, the link between the role of 11&#x3b2;-HSD1 in the hypothalamus and obesity has yet to be determined. In the present study, embryonal primary hypothalamic neurones and high-fat diet (HFD) fed mice were used to investigate the anorexigenic effects of 11&#x3b2;-HSD1 inhibitors both in vitro and in vivo. In hypothalamic neurones, carbenoxolone (a non selecitve 11&#x3b2;-HSD inhibitor) alleviated ER stress and ER stress-induced neuropeptide alterations. In HFD mice, i.c.v. administration of carbenoxolone or KR67500 (nonselective and selective 11&#x3b2;-HSD1 inhibitors, respectively) was associated with less weight gain compared to control mice for 24&#xa0;hours after treatment, presumably by reducing food intake. Furthermore, glucose regulated protein (Grp78), spliced X-box binding protein (Xbp-1s), c/EBP homologous protein (chop) and ER DnaJ homologue protein (Erdj4) expression was decreased in the hypothalami of mice administrated 11&#x3b2;-HSD1 inhibitors compared to controls. Conversely, the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK) and S6 kinase1 (S6K1) in the hypothalamus was induced more in mice treated using the same regimes. In conclusion, acute 11&#x3b2;-HSD1 inhibition in the hypothalamus could reduce food intake by decreasing ER stress and increasing insulin, leptin, and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling.",

    "title": "Glucose-lowering therapies in type 2 diabetes: Opportunities and challenges for peptides.",
    "abstract": "This overview considers the opportunities and challenges that face the use of gluco-regulatory peptides to treat type 2 diabetes. New insulin analogues and formulations are being developed with pharmacokinetic properties to speed-up or prolong transfer from a subcutaneous injection site to the target tissues, or to selectively favour effects on the liver. Alternative routes of insulin administration continue to attract attention, and advances in the integration of glucose monitoring with insulin pump devices are improving miniaturised 'closed loop' artificial pancreas systems. Proof of concept has been established for non-cellular glucose-responsive insulin delivery ('smart insulins') to release insulin from implants or circulating depots in proportion to circulating glucose. The many peptides involved in blood glucose control offer diverse therapeutic opportunities. Exploitation of multiple selected receptor targets using constructs of hybrid and chimeric peptides, especially those based on glucagon and gastrointestinal hormones, has gained much credence from initial preclinical studies. Peptide templates identified from comparative endocrine studies have also provided valuable insights in this respect and indicated novel approaches to address associated conditions such as obesity and infections at the same time. Nevertheless, there are many challenges to the use of therapeutic peptides that impose on every step in the complex pathway from design and testing through to making a fully characterised therapeutic product, and optimising administration, tissue targeting and degradation. Stability of peptides and immunological uncertainties of novel structures require particular consideration as well as the need to avoid over-reduction of blood glucose into hypoglycaemia.",

In this review, we aim to describe bone marrow adipose tissue and discuss the soluble adipocyte-derived cytokines (adipokines) or endocrine factors, adipocyte-derived lipids, and the actual or putative juxtacrine signaling between bone marrow adipocytes and tumor cells in the bone marrow. This relationship likely affects tumor cell initiation, proliferation, metastasis, and/or drug resistance. Bone marrow adipose may affect tumor proliferation, drug resistance, or cancer-induced bone disease and hence may be a new target in the fight against cancer. Overall, evidence is mixed regarding the role of bone marrow adipose and adipocytes in cancer progression, and more research in this arena is necessary to determine how these bone marrow microenvironmental cells contribute to malignancies in the marrow to identify novel, potentially targetable pathways.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin is a major adipocytokine secreted from mammalian adipocytes. Relatively low expression of adiponectin is associated with various human metabolic diseases and some cancers. Adiponectin-secreting compounds have therapeutic potential for these diseases. Adipogenesis of human bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) has been used as a phenotypic assay to find adiponectin secreting compounds. In a phytochemical library screen, 2-formyl-komarovicine, 1-(quinolin-8-yl)-1,3,4,9-tetrahydro-2H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole-2-carbaldehyde, isolated from Nitraria komarovii was identified as a potential adiponectin-secreting compound. To validate the results of the impure phytochemical, we synthesized 2-formyl-komarovicine. The synthetic 2-formyl-komarovicine significantly promoted adiponectin production during adipogenesis in hBM-MSCs. In a target identification experiment, 2-formyl-komarovicine bound to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x3b3; (PPAR&#x3b3;) in a concentration-dependent manner. Notably, 2-formyl-komarovicine competitively inhibited the adiponectin-promoting activity of a full PPAR&#x3b3; agonist, troglitazone, in hBM-MSCs, which is a pharmacological feature of a partial agonist. The ligand-docking model showed that 2-formyl-komarovicine interacted with the hydrophobic pocket of the PPAR&#x3b3; ligand-binding domain, but lacked an interaction to stabilize helix H12, which is one of the major binding themes of PPAR&#x3b3; partial agonists. We concluded that 2-formyl-komarovicine provides a novel pharmacophore for PPAR&#x3b3; partial agonists to increase adiponectin production.",

Alterations in adiponectin levels have been shown to directly affect lipid and glucose metabolism that further increase the synthesis of lipids, free fatty acids and inflammatory cytokines. Changes in adiponectin levels also contribute to insulin resistance, obesity, cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. In the present review, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of the role of adiponectin and its molecular mechanisms in metabolic syndrome. Clinical improvement in adiponectin levels have been shown to positively modulate lipid and glucose metabolism, thus further substantiating its role in regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism. Currently adiponectin is being investigated as a potential therapeutic target for metabolic syndrome, although more research is required to understand the underlying mechanisms controlling adiponectin levels, including dietary and lifestyle interventions, that may target adiponectin as a therapeutic intervention in metabolic syndrome.",

    "abstract": "What are the effects of high-glucose concentrations on DNA methylation of human oocytes? High-glucose concentrations altered DNA methylation levels of Peg3 and Adiponectin in human in vitro maturation oocytes. Maternal diabetes has a detrimental influence on oocyte quality including epigenetic modifications, as shown in non-human mammalian species. Immature metaphase I (MI) stage oocytes of good quality were retrieved from patients who had normal ovarian potential and who underwent ICSI in the Reproductive Medicine Center of People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University. MI oocytes were cultured in medium with different glucose concentrations (control, 10 mM and 15 mM) in vitro and 48 h later, oocytes with first polar body extrusion were collected to check the DNA methylation levels. MI oocytes underwent in vitro maturation (IVM) at 37&#xb0;C with 5% mixed gas for 48 h. Then the mature oocytes were treated with bisulfite buffer. Target sequences were amplified using nested or half-nested PCR and the DNA methylation status was tested using combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) and bisulfite sequencing (BS). High-glucose concentrations significantly decreased the first polar body extrusion rate. Compared to controls, the DNA methylation levels of Peg3 in human IVM oocytes were significantly higher in 10 mM (P &lt; 0.001) and 15 mM (P &lt; 0.001) concentrations of glucose. But the DNA methylation level of H19 was not affected by high-glucose concentrations in human IVM oocytes. We also found that there was a decrease in DNA methylation levels in the promoter of adiponectin in human IVM oocytes between controls and oocytes exposed to 10 mM glucose (P = 0.028). N/A. It is not clear whether the alterations are beneficial or not for the embryo development and offspring health. The effects of high-glucose concentrations on the whole process of oocyte maturation are still not elucidated. Another issue is that the number of oocytes used in this study was limited. This is the first time that the effects of high-glucose concentration on DNA methylation of human oocytes have been elucidated. Our result indicates that in humans, the high risk of chronic diseases in offspring from diabetic mothers may originate from abnormal DNA modifications in oocytes.

    "abstract": "Adiponectin (APN) is a protein hormone that is primarily derived from adipocytes. It can also be secreted by renal cells. Hypoadiponectinemia has been documented in patients with hyperuricemia, however, whether soluble uric acid (SUA) regulates the expression of APN and APN receptor 1 (AdipoR1) in renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (PTECs) remains to be elucidated. The present study investigated the expression of APN and AdipoR1 in cultured PTECs that were exposed to SUA through immunofluorescence and western blot analysis. In addition, Sprague&#x2011;Dawley rats with oxonic acid&#x2011;induced hyperuricemia (HUA) with or without febuxostat treatment were employed as an animal model to measure 24&#xa0;h urine protein, serum creatinine, urea nitrogen, uric acid and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance. Renal pathology was evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemical staining. APN and AdipoR1 expression in the renal cortex were evaluated by western blotting. The results demonstrated that, in PTECs, the expression of APN and AdipoR1 was constant and increased upon SUA exposure. Similar observations were made within the proximal renal tubules of rats, and the oxonic acid&#x2011;induced increases in APN and AdipoR1 were offset by febuxostat treatment. Furthermore, SUA&#x2011;treated PTECs exhibited an increase in the expression of NLR family pyrin domain&#x2011;containing (NLRP) 3, which was dose&#x2011;dependent. NLRP3 expression was also significantly increased in the renal cortex of HUA rats compared with control and febuxostat&#x2011;treated rats. In conclusion, SUA enhanced the expression of APN and AdipoR1 in PTECs, which was associated with an increase in NLRP3 expression. The APN&#x2011;AdipoR1 pathway was demonstrated to have an important role in in&#xa0;vitro and in&#xa0;vivo models of renal proximal tubule inflammatory injury. Therefore, this pathway may be a potential therapy target in urate nephropathy.",

    "abstract": "Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is cushion of fat tissue surrounding blood vessels, which is phenotypically different from other adipose tissue depots. PVAT is composed of adipocytes and stromal vascular fraction, constituted by different populations of immune cells, endothelial cells, and adipose-derived stromal cells. It expresses and releases an important number of vasoactive factors with paracrine effects on vascular structure and function. In healthy individuals, these factors elicit a net anticontractile and anti-inflammatory paracrine effect aimed at meeting hemodynamic and metabolic demands of specific organs and regions of the body. Pathophysiological situations, such as obesity, diabetes or hypertension, induce changes in its amount and in the expression pattern of vasoactive factors leading to a PVAT dysfunction in which the beneficial paracrine influence of PVAT is shifted to a pro-oxidant, proinflammatory, contractile, and trophic environment leading to functional and structural cardiovascular alterations and cardiovascular disease. Many different PVATs surrounding a variety of blood vessels have been described and exhibit regional differences. Both protective and deleterious influence of PVAT differs regionally depending on the specific vascular bed contributing to variations in the susceptibility of arteries and veins to vascular disease. PVAT therefore, might represent a novel target for pharmacological intervention in cardiovascular disease. &#xa9; 2018 American Physiological Society. Compr Physiol 8:23-59, 2018.",

    "abstract": "The mechanism of linking neonatal seizures with long-term brain damage is unclear, and there is no effective drug to block this long-term pathological process. Recently, the fat-derived hormone leptin has been appreciated for its neuroprotective function in neurodegenerative processes, although less is known about the effects of leptin on neonatal seizure-induced brain damage. Here, we developed a twist seizure model by coupling pilocarpine-induced neonatal status epilepticus (SE) with later exposure to penicillin to test whether leptin treatment immediately after neonatal SE would exert neuroprotective effects on cognition, seizure threshold and hippocampal mossy fiber sprouting, as well if leptin had any influence on the expression of zinc transporter 3 (ZnT3) and calcium homeostasis-related CB-D28k in the hippocampus. Fifty Sprague-Dawley rats (postnatal day 6, P6) were randomly assigned to four groups: control (n&#x202f;=&#x202f;10), control with intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of leptin (Leptin, n&#x202f;=&#x202f;10), pilocarpine-induced neonatal SE (RS), and RS i.p. leptin injection (RS+Leptin). At P6, all the rats in the RS group and RS+Leptin group were injected with lithium chloride i.p. (5 mEq/kg). Pilocarpine (320&#x202f;mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 30&#x202f;min after scopolamine methyl chloride (1&#x202f;mg/kg) injection at P7 to block the peripheral effect of pilocarpine. From P8 to P14, the animals in the Leptin group and RS+Leptin group were given leptin (4&#x202f;mg/kg, i.p.). The Morris water maze test was performed during P28-P33. Following routine seizure threshold detection and Timm staining procedures, Western blot analysis was performed for each group. Pilocarpine-induced neonatal SE severely impaired learning and memory abilities, reduced seizure threshold, and induced aberrant hippocampal CA3 mossy fiber sprouting. In parallel, there was a significantly down-regulated protein level of CB-D28k and an up-regulated protein level of ZnT3 in the hippocampus of the RS group. Furthermore, leptin treatment soon after neonatal SE for seven consecutive days counteracted these hyperexcitability-related alterations. These novel findings established that leptin has a neuroprotective role in the model of cholinergic neonatal SE and highlights ZnT3/CB-D28k associated-Zn (2+)/Ca (2+) signaling as a promising therapeutic target.",

    "title": "High fat diet blunts the effects of leptin on ventilation and on carotid body activity.",
    "abstract": "Leptin plays a role in the control of breathing, acting mainly on central nervous system; however, leptin receptors have been recently shown to be expressed in the carotid body (CB), and this finding suggests a physiological role for leptin in the regulation of CB function. Leptin increases minute ventilation in both basal and hypoxic conditions in rats. It increases the frequency of carotid sinus nerve discharge in basal conditions, as well as the release of adenosine from the CB. However, in a metabolic syndrome animal model, the effects of leptin in ventilatory control, carotid sinus nerve activity and adenosine release by the CB are blunted. Although leptin may be involved in triggering CB overactivation in initial stages of obesity and dysmetabolism, resistance to leptin signalling and blunting of responses develops in metabolic syndrome animal models. Leptin plays a role in the control of breathing, acting mainly on central nervous system structures. Leptin receptors are expressed in the carotid body (CB) and this finding has been associated with a putative physiological role of leptin in the regulation of CB function. Since, the CBs are implicated in energy metabolism, here we tested the effects of different concentrations of leptin administration on ventilatory parameters and on carotid sinus nerve (CSN) activity in control and high-fat (HF) diet fed rats, in order to clarify the role of leptin in ventilation control in metabolic disease states. We also investigated the expression of leptin receptors and the neurotransmitters involved in leptin signalling in the CBs. We found that in non-disease conditions, leptin increases minute ventilation in both basal and hypoxic conditions. However, in the HF model, the effect of leptin in ventilatory control is blunted. We also observed that HF rats display an increased frequency of CSN discharge in basal conditions that is not altered by leptin, in contrast to what is observed in control animals. Leptin did not modify intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in CB chemoreceptor cells, but it produced an increase in the release of adenosine from the whole CB. We conclude that CBs represent an important target for leptin signalling, not only to coordinate peripheral ventilatory chemoreflexive drive, but probably also to modulate metabolic variables. We also concluded that leptin signalling is mediated by adenosine release and that HF diets blunt leptin responses in the CB, compromising ventilatory adaptation.",

We aimed to verify the effect of inhibition of FABP4 on GI transit in vivo, and to determine the expression of FABP4 in mouse and human tissues. Fatty acid binding protein 4 inhibitor, BMS309403, was administered acutely or chronically for 6 and 13 consecutive days and its effect on GI transit was assessed in physiological conditions and in loperamide-induced constipation. Intracellular recordings were made to examine the effects of BMS309403 on colonic excitatory and inhibitory junction potentials. Abdominal pain was evaluated using behavioral pain response. Localization and expression of selected adipokines were determined in the mouse colon and serum using immunohistochemistry and Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay respectively. mRNA expression of FABP4 and selected adipokines in colonic and serum samples from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients and control group were assessed. Acute injection of BMS309403 significantly increased GI motility and reversed inhibitory effect of loperamide. BMS309403 did not change colonic membrane potentials. Chronic treatment with BMS309403 increased the number of pain-induced behaviors. In the mouse serum, level of resistin was significantly decreased after acute administration; no changes in adiponectin level were detected. In the human serum, level of adiponectin and resistin, but not of FABP4, were significantly elevated in patients with constipation-IBS (IBS-C). FABP4 mRNA expression was significantly downregulated in the human colon in IBS-C. Fatty acid binding protein 4 may be involved in IBS pathogenesis and become a novel target in the treatment of constipation-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "The protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B is a negative regulator of insulin and leptin signaling and a highly validated therapeutic target for diabetes and obesity. Conventional approaches to drug development have produced potent and specific PTP1B inhibitors, but these inhibitors lack oral bioavailability, which limits their potential for drug development. Here, we report that DPM-1001, an analog of the specific PTP1B inhibitor trodusquemine (MSI-1436), is a potent, specific, and orally bioavailable inhibitor of PTP1B. DPM-1001 also chelates copper, which enhanced its potency as a PTP1B inhibitor. DPM-1001 displayed anti-diabetic properties that were associated with enhanced signaling through insulin and leptin receptors in animal models of diet-induced obesity. Therefore, DPM-1001 represents a proof of concept for a new approach to therapeutic intervention in diabetes and obesity. Although the PTPs have been considered undruggable, the findings of this study suggest that allosteric PTP inhibitors may help reinvigorate drug development efforts that focus on this important family of signal-transducing enzymes.",

Using a well-established obese mouse model induced by a high-fat diet, we found that: (1) the acute thermal pain sensory threshold did not change in obese mice; (2) the model obese mice had fewer nociceptive responses in formalin-induced inflammatory pain tests; restoring the obese mice to a chow diet for three weeks partly recovered their pain sensation; (3) leptin injection induced significant phosphorylation of STAT3 in control mice but not in obese mice, indicating the dysmodulation of topical leptin-leptin receptor signaling in these mice; and (4) leptin-leptin receptor signaling-deficient mice (ob/ob and db/db) or leptin-leptin receptor pathway blockade with a leptin receptor antagonist and the JAK2 inhibitor AG 490 in wild-type mice reduced their nociceptive responses in formalin tests.

    "abstract": "Sulphur mustard (2,2'-dichloroethyl sulfide; SM) is a vesicant chemical warfare agent whose mechanism of acute or chronic action is not known with any certainty and to date there is no effective antidote. SM accumulation in adipose tissue (AT) has been originally verified in our previous study. To evaluate the biological effect caused by the presence of abundant SM in adipocyte and assess the biological role of AT in SM poisoning, in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed. High content analysis revealed multi-cytotoxicity in SM exposed cells in a time and dose dependent manner, and adipocytes showed a relative moderate damage compared with non-adipocytes. Cell co-culture model was established and revealed the adverse effect of SM-exposed adipocyte supernatant on the growth of co-cultured cells. The pathological changes in AT from 10mg/kg SM percutaneously exposed rats were checked and inflammation phenomena were observed. The mRNA and protein levels of inflammation-related adipokines secreted from AT in rats exposed to 1, 3 and 10mg/kg doses of SM were determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The expressions of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory adipokines together promoted the inflammation development in the body. The positive correlations between AT and serum adipokine levels were explored, which demonstrated a substantial role of AT in systemic inflammation responding to SM exposure. Thus, AT is not only a target of SM but also a modulator in the SM toxicity.",

    "abstract": "The role of central leptin in regulating the heart from lipid accumulation in lean leptin-sensitive animals has not been fully elucidated. Herein, we investigated the effects of central leptin infusion on the expression of genes involved in cardiac metabolism and its role in the control of myocardial triacylglyceride (TAG) accumulation in adult Wistar rats. Intracerebroventricular (icv) leptin infusion (0.2&#x2009;&#xb5;g/day) for 7 days markedly decreased TAG levels in cardiac tissue. Remarkably, the cardiac anti-steatotic effects of central leptin were associated with the selective upregulation of gene and protein expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x3b2;/&#x3b4; (PPAR&#x3b2;/&#x3b4;, encoded by Pparb/d) and their target genes, adipose triglyceride lipase (encoded by Pnpla2, herefater referred to as Atgl), hormone sensitive lipase (encoded by Lipe, herefater referred to as Hsl), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (Pdk4) and acyl CoA oxidase 1 (Acox1), involved in myocardial intracellular lipolysis and mitochondrial/peroxisomal fatty acid utilization. Besides, central leptin decreased the expression of stearoyl-CoA deaturase 1 (Scd1) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (Dgat1) involved in TAG synthesis and increased the CPT-1 independent palmitate oxidation, as an index of peroxisomal &#x3b2;-oxidation. Finally, the pharmacological inhibition of PPAR&#x3b2;/&#x3b4; decreased the effects on gene expression and cardiac TAG content induced by leptin. These results indicate that leptin, acting at central level, regulates selectively the cardiac expression of PPAR&#x3b2;/&#x3b4;, contributing in this way to regulate the cardiac TAG accumulation in rats, independently of its effects on body weight.",

We focused on determining the neuroprotective effect offered by adiponectin against streptozotocin-induced brain damage in ICV-STZ rat model. We found that adiponectin supplements significantly restored the cognitive deficits in ICV-STZ rat model including shorter escape latency, more crossing times and increased time spent in the target quadrant. Adiponectin supplements also increased number of dendritic branches and mushroom percentage. In addition, adiponectin supplements attenuated tau hyperphosphorylation at multiple AD-related sites through activation of&#xa0;protein Ser9-phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3&#x3b2; (Ser9-GSK-3&#x3b2;) with increased the Akt and PI3K activity.

    "abstract": "Chronic alcohol consumption causes alcohol-induced lipogenesis and promotes hepatic injury by preventing the oxidation of hepatocellular fatty acids through the suppression of the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). HIMH0021, an active flavonoid compound, which is a component of the Acer tegmentosum extract, has been shown to protect against liver damage caused by alcohol consumption. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to determine whether HIMH0021 could regulate alcoholic fatty liver and liver injury in mice. Oral administration of 10 days of Lieber-DeCarli ethanol plus a single binge of 30% ethanol (chronic-plus-binge model) induced steatosis and liver injury and inflammation in mice, which appears similar to the condition observed in human patients with alcohol-related diseases. HIMH0021, which was isolated from the active methanol extract of A. tegmentosum, inhibited alcohol-induced steatosis and attenuated the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) during hepatocellular alcohol metabolism, both of which promote lipogenesis as well as liver inflammation. Treatment with HIMH0021 conferred protection against lipogenesis and liver injury, inhibited the expression of cytochrome P4502E1, and increased serum adiponectin levels in the mice subjected to chronic-plus-binge feeding. Furthermore, in hepatocytes, HIMH0021 activated fatty acid oxidation by activating pAMPK, which comprises pACC and CPT1a. These findings suggested that HIMH0021 could be used to target a TNF&#x3b1;-related pathway for treating patients with alcoholic hepatitis.",

    "abstract": "CD36 is a multiligand receptor involved in lipid metabolism. We investigated the mechanisms underlying the cardioprotective effect of CP-3(iv), an azapeptide belonging to a new class of selective CD36 ligands. The role of CP-3(iv) in mediating cardioprotection was investigated because CD36 signaling leads to activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#x3b3;, a transcriptional regulator of adiponectin. CP-3(iv) pretreatment reduced infarct size by 54% and preserved hemodynamics in C57BL/6 mice subjected to 30 min coronary ligation and reperfusion but had no effect in CD36-deficient mice. The effects of CP-3(iv) were associated with an increase in circulating adiponectin levels, epididymal fat adiponectin gene expression, and adiponectin transcriptional regulators ( Pparg, Cebpb, Sirt1) after 6 h of reperfusion. Reduced myocardial oxidative stress and apoptosis were observed along with an increase in expression of myocardial adiponectin target proteins, including cyclooxygenase-2, phospho-AMPK, and phospho-Akt. Moreover, CP-3(iv) increased myocardial performance in isolated hearts, whereas blockade of adiponectin with an anti-adiponectin antibody abrogated it. CP-3(iv) exerts cardioprotection against myocardial ischemia and reperfusion (MI/R) injury and dysfunction, at least in part, by increasing circulating and myocardial adiponectin levels. Hence, both paracrine and endocrine effects of adiponectin may contribute to reduced reactive oxygen species generation and apoptosis after MI/R, in a CD36-dependent manner.-Huynh, D. N., Bessi, V.

    "abstract": "Previously, we demonstrated that a grape seed procyanidin extract (GSPE) supplementation in pregnant and lactating rats exerted both healthy and deleterious programming effects on their offspring. Here, we evaluated whether the administration of GSPE during lactation (100&#x2009;mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>.day<sup>-1</sup>) in rats elicited beneficial effects in their normoweight (STD-GSPE group) and cafeteria-fed obese (CAF-GSPE group) adult male offspring. STD-GSPE and CAF-GSPE offspring showed increased energy expenditure and circulating total and high-molecular-weight adiponectin. However, these rats showed hyperinsulinemia, decreased insulin sensitivity, increased insulin resistance, down-regulated mRNA levels of adiponectin receptors in inguinal white adipose tissue (Adipor1 and Adipor2) and soleus muscle (Adipor2), and decreased levels of phosphorylated AMPK, the downstream post-receptor target of adiponectin, in the soleus muscle. These deleterious effects could be related to an increased lipid transfer to the pups through the milk, since GSPE-supplemented dams displayed decreased fat content and increased expression of lipogenic genes in their mammary glands, in addition to increased circulating total adiponectin and non-esterified free fatty acids. In conclusion, maternal intake of GSPE during lactation induced insulin resistance and an adiponectin resistance-like phenotype in their normoweight and obese offspring. These findings raise concerns about the possibility of using GSPE as a nutraceutical supplement during this period.",

    "title": "The increase in fiber size in male rat gastrocnemius after chronic central leptin infusion is related to activation of insulin signaling.",
    "abstract": "Insulin potentiates leptin effects on muscle accrual and glucose homeostasis. However, the relationship between leptin's central effects on peripheral insulin sensitivity and the associated structural changes remain unclear. We hypothesized that central leptin infusion modifies muscle size through activation of insulin signaling. Muscle insulin signaling, enzymes of fatty acid metabolism, mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and fiber area were analyzed in the gastrocnemius of chronic central infused (L), pair-fed (PF) and control rats. PCNA-positive nuclei, fiber area, GLUT4 and glycogen levels and activation of Akt and mechanistic target of rapamycin were increased in L, with no changes in PF. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase-&#x3b2; mRNA levels and non-esterified fatty acid and triglyceride content were reduced and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1b expression and mitochondrial complexes augmented in L. These results suggest that leptin promotes an increase in muscle size associated with improved insulin signaling favored by lipid profile.",

    "title": "Synthetic peptides designed to modulate adiponectin assembly improve obesity-related metabolic disorders.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin, an adipokine possessing profound insulin-sensitizing and anti-inflammatory properties, is a potent biotherapeutic agent . The trimeric adiponectin subunit assembles into hexameric and functionally important higher molecular weight (HMW) forms, controlled by the endoplasmic reticulum protein 44 (ERp44). Obesity-induced ER stress decreases the HMW form in serum, contributing to the development of insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes. In this study, a panel of synthetic peptides, designed to target ERp44-adiponectin interactions, were tested for their effects on circulating levels of HMW adiponectin. Peptides derived from the ERp44 binding region of adiponectin and immunoglobulin IgM were synthesized with or without a cell-penetrating sequence. Cultures of 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with the peptides for assessing the assembly and secretion of HMW adiponectin. Mice given standard chow or a high-fat diet were treated acutely or chronically, with the peptides to investigate the therapeutic effects on insulin sensitivity and energy metabolism. The designed peptides interfered with ERp44-adiponectin interactions and modulated adiponectin assembly and release from adipocytes. In particular, IgM-derived peptides facilitated the release of endogenous adiponectin (especially the HMW form) from adipose tissue, enhanced its circulating level and the ratio of HMW-to-total-adiponectin in obese mice. Long-term treatment of mice fed with high-fat diet by IgM-derived peptides reduced the circulating lipid levels and improved insulin sensitivity. Targeting ERp44-adiponectin interactions with short peptides represents an effective strategy to treat of obesity-related metabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Amino acid composition and isoflavone are alleged contributors to the beneficial effects of soy protein isolate (SPI) on lipid metabolism. Therefore, we investigated the contributing component(s) of SPI in a maternal diet to the regulation of lipid metabolism in offspring. We also determined serum parameters in dams to investigate specific maternal cues that might be responsible for this regulation. Female rats were fed either a casein (CAS), a low-isoflavone SPI, or a casein plus genistein (GEN, 250 mg/kg) diet for two weeks before mating, as well as during pregnancy and lactation. Male offspring (CAS, SPI and GEN groups) were studied 21 days after birth. The SPI group had lower serum triglyceride levels than the other groups. Serum cholesterol was reduced in both the SPI and GEN groups compared with the CAS group. Expressions of target genes of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x3b1; were altered in the SPI group. Serum aromatic amino acid levels in dams were associated with serum triglyceride in offspring. In conclusion, the maternal consumption of a low-isoflavone SPI diet or a casein diet containing genistein has different effects on the lipid metabolism of their offspring; however, more profound effects were observed in the SPI group. Therefore, the altered lipid metabolism of offspring may be attributed to amino acid composition in maternal dietary protein sources.",

    "title": "Preclinical pharmacokinetic characterization of an adipose tissue-targeting monoclonal antibody in obese and non-obese animals.",
    "abstract": "Target receptor levels can influence pharmacokinetics (PK) or pharmacodynamics (PD) of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and can affect drug development of this class of molecules. We generated an effector-less humanized bispecific antibody that selectively activates fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)1 and &#x3b2;Klotho receptor, a FGF21 receptor complex highly expressed in both white and brown adipocytes. The molecule shows cross-species binding with comparable equilibrium binding affinity (Kd) for human, cynomolgus monkey, and mouse FGFR1/&#x3b2;Klotho. To understand the PK/PD relationship in non-obese and obese animals, we evaluated the adipose tissue distribution of the antibody, serum exposures, and an associated PD marker (high-molecular-weight adiponectin), in both non-obese and obese mice and monkeys. Antibody uptake into fat tissue was found to be higher on a per gram basis in non-obese animals compared to obese animals. Since obesity has been reported to be associated with reduced expression of FGFR1 and &#x3b2;Klotho receptor in white adipose tissues in mice, our results suggest that the distribution in adipose tissues was influenced by target expression levels. Even so, the overall dose-normalized serum exposures were comparable between non-obese and obese mice and monkeys, suggesting that adipose tissue uptake plays a limited role in overall systemic PK determination. It remains to be determined if and how obesity and receptor expression in humans influence the PK and PD profile of this novel therapeutic candidate.",

    "title": "A critical period for the trophic actions of leptin on AgRP neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus.",
    "abstract": "In the developing hypothalamus, the fat-derived hormone leptin stimulates the growth of axons from the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARH) to other regions that control energy balance. These projections are significantly reduced in leptin deficient (Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup> ) mice and this phenotype is largely rescued by neonatal leptin treatments. However, treatment of mature Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup> mice is ineffective, suggesting that the trophic action of leptin is limited to a developmental critical period. To temporally delineate closure of this critical period for leptin-stimulated growth, we treated Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup> mice with exogenous leptin during a variety of discrete time periods, and measured the density of Agouti-Related Peptide (AgRP) containing projections from the ARH to the ventral part of the dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (DMHv), and to the medial parvocellular part of the paraventricular nucleus (PVHmp). The results indicate that leptin loses its neurotrophic potential at or near postnatal day 28. The duration of leptin exposure appears to be important, with 9- or 11-day treatments found to be more effective than shorter (5-day) treatments. Furthermore, leptin treatment for 9 days or more was sufficient to restore AgRP innervation to both the PVHmp and DMHv in Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup> females, but only to the DMHv in Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup> males. Together, these findings reveal that the trophic actions of leptin are contingent upon timing and duration of leptin exposure, display both target and sex specificity, and that modulation of leptin-dependent circuit formation by each of these factors may carry enduring consequences for feeding behavior, metabolism, and obesity risk.",

    "abstract": "The insulin sensitizing glitazone drugs, rosiglitazone (ROS) and pioglitazone (PGZ) both have anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory effects and induce adipose tissue (fat) to produce the vaso-protective protein adiponectin. Stenosis due to intimal hyperplasia development often occurs after placement of arteriovenous synthetic grafts used for hemodialysis. This work was performed to characterize the in vitro and in vivo effects of ROS or PGZ incorporation in fat and to determine if fat/PGZ depots could decrease vascular hyperplasia development in a porcine model of hemodialysis arteriovenous graft stenosis. Powdered ROS or PGZ (6-6000&#x3bc;M) was mixed with fat explants and cultured. Drug release from fat was quantified by HPLC/MS/MS, and adiponectin and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) levels in culture media were measured by ELISA. The effect of conditioned media from the culture of fat with ROS or PGZ on i) platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB)-stimulated proliferation of human venous smooth muscle cells (SMC) was measured by a DNA-binding assay, and ii) lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced human monocyte release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF&#x3b1;) was assessed by ELISA. In a porcine model, pharmacokinetics of PGZ from fat depots transplanted perivascular to jugular vein were assessed by HPLC/MS/MS, and retention of the fat depot was monitored by MRI. A porcine model of synthetic graft placed between carotid artery and ipsilateral jugular vein was used to assess effects of PGZ/fat depots on vascular hyperplasia development. Both ROS and PGZ significantly induced the release of adiponectin and inhibited release of MCP-1 from the fat. TNF production from monocytes stimulated with LPS was inhibited 50-70% in the presence of media conditioned by fat alone or fat and either drug. The proliferation of SMC was inhibited in the presence of media conditioned by fat/ROS cultures. Fat explants placed perivascular to the external jugular vein were retained, as confirmed by MRI at one week after placement. PGZ was detected in the fat depot, in the external jugular vein wall and in adjacent tissue at clinically relevant levels, whereas levels in plasma were below detection. External jugular vein exposed to fat incorporated with PGZ had increased adiponectin expression compared to vein exposed to fat alone. However, the development of hyperplasia within the arteriovenous synthetic grafts was unchanged by treatment with fat/PGZ depots compared to no treatment.",

    "title": "Leptin is essential for microglial activation and neuropathic pain after preganglionic cervical root avulsion.",
    "abstract": "Preganglionic cervical root avulsion (PCRA) affects both the peripheral and central nervous systems and is often associated with neuropathic pain. Unlike peripheral nerve injuries (PNI), central lesions caused by disruption of cervical roots from the spinal cord following PCRA contribute to the generation of neuropathic pain. Leptin is involved in the development of neuropathic pain after PNI by affecting neurons. However, whether leptin is involved in microglial activation leading to neuropathic pain after PCRA is unknown. Preganglionic avulsion of the left 6<sup>th</sup>-8<sup>th</sup> cervical roots was performed in C57B/6J mice and leptin-deficient mice. A leptin antagonist or leptin was administered to C57B/6J mice and leptin-deficient mice after injury, respectively. The expression pattern of spinal and supraspinal microglia was examined by immunofluorescent staining. Von Frey filaments were used to test pain sensitivity. Leptin is essential for the development of neuropathic pain after PCRA. Allodynia was absent in the leptin-deficient mice and the mice administered the leptin antagonist. We also found that leptin deficiency or the administration of its antagonist inhibited the development of microgliosis in the dorsal horn and brainstem. Furthermore, increase in the expression of CD86 and iNOS, and Wallerian degeneration were noted in the spinal cord. The administration of exogenous leptin to leptin-deficient mice reversed these effects. We concluded that leptin is involved in the proliferation and activation of microglia, which in turn enhances the development of neuropathic pain. Blocking the effects of leptin might be a target for the treatment of neuropathic pain after PCRA.",

    "title": "Globular adiponectin reverses osteo-sarcopenia and altered body composition in ovariectomized rats.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin regulates various metabolic processes including glucose flux, lipid breakdown and insulin response. We recently reported that adiponectin receptor1 (adipoR1) activation by a small molecule reverses osteopenia in leptin receptor deficient db/db (diabetic) mice. However, the role of adiponectin in bone metabolism under the setting of post-menopausal (estrogen-deficiency) osteopenia and associated metabolic derangements has not been studied. Here, we studied the therapeutic effect of the globular form of adiponectin (gAd), which is predominantly an adipoR1 agonist, in aged ovariectomized (OVX) rats and compared it with standard-of-care anti-osteoporosis drugs. In OVX rats with established osteopenia, gAd completely restored BMD and load bearing capacity and improved bone quality. Skeletal effects of gAd were comparable to PTH (osteoanabolic) but better than alendronate (anti-catabolic). Both osteoanabolic and anti-catabolic mechanisms led to the anti-osteoporosis effect of gAd. In cultured osteoblasts and bones, gAd increased a) adipoR1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1&#x3b1;) expression to promote mitochondrial respiration, which likely fueled osteoblast differentiation, b) suppressed sclerostin (a wnt antagonist) in a sirtuin1-dependent manner and c) decreased receptor-activator of nuclear factor &#x3ba;B ligand (RANKL) to achieve its anti-catabolic effect. The OVX-induced sarcopenia and insulin resistance were also improved by gAd. We conclude that gAd has therapeutic efficacy in estrogen deficiency-induced osteoporosis, sarcopenia and insulin resistance and hold metabolic disease modifying potential in postmenopausal women.",

    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) results in decreased bone strength. Serotonin (5-HT) is one of the critical regulators of bone health, fulfilling distinct functions depending on its synthesis site: brain-derived serotonin (BDS) favors osteoblast proliferation, whereas gut-derived serotonin (GDS) inhibits it. We assessed the role of BDS and peripheral leptin in the regulation of bone metabolism and strength in young rats with 5/6 nephrectomy. BDS synthesis was accelerated during CKD progression. Decreased peripheral leptin in CKD rats was inversely related to BDS content in the hypothalamus, brainstem and frontal cortex. Serotonin in these brain regions affected bone strength and metabolism in the studied animals. The direct effect of circulating leptin on bone was not shown in uremia. At the molecular level, there was an inverse association between elevated GDS and the expression of cAMP responsive element-binding protein (Creb) gene in bone of CKD animals. In contrast, increased expression of activating transcription factor 4 (Atf4) was shown, which was associated with GDS-dependent transcription factor 1 (Foxo1), clock gene - Cry-1, cell cycle genes: c-Myc, cyclins, and osteoblast differentiation genes. These results identified a previously unknown molecular pathway, by which elevated GDS can shift in Foxo1 target genes from Creb to Atf4-dependent response, disrupting the leptin-BDS - dependent gene pathway in the bone of uremic rats. Thus, in the condition of CKD the effect of BDS and GDS on bone metabolism and strength can't be distinguished.",

    "title": "Leptin promotes the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells by upregulating ACAT2.",
    "abstract": "Previously, it has been shown that obesity may be considered as a risk factor for breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Leptin, a hormone whose level is elevated in obesity, has been suggested to be involved in the development of breast cancer, and univariate survival analyses have shown that over-expression of ACAT2, an enzyme that is involved in the production of cholesteryl esters, may be associated with a poor prognosis. Here, we aimed to investigate the effect of leptin on the proliferation, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells, as well as to elucidate its underlying mode of action. Gene expression changes in leptin treated breast cancer-derived MCF-7, T47D and BT474 cells were assessed using PCR array, qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses. The expression patterns of Ob-R (leptin receptor) and ACAT2 in breast cancer cells and primary breast cancer tissue samples were analyzed using immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Leptin-induced proliferation of breast cancer cells was assessed using a CCK8 assay, and scratch wound and Transwell assays were used to assess breast cancer cell invasion and migration. We found that, among the genes tested, ACAT2 expression exhibited the most significant changes in the leptin treated cells. In addition, we found that inhibition of ACAT2 expression using pyripyropene A (PPPA) or siRNA-mediated gene silencing significantly decreased leptin-induced proliferation, migration and invasion of MCF-7 and T47D cells. Subsequent Western blot analyses strongly indicated that the PI3K/AKT/SREBP2 signaling pathway was involved in leptin-induced ACAT2 upregulation in both MCF-7 and T47D cells. Finally, through the analysis of primary breast cancer tissue samples we found that ACAT2 may affect cancer progression through activation of&#xa0;the Ob-R. Our data indicate that leptin may enhance the proliferation, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells via ACAT2 up-regulation through the PI3K/AKT/SREBP2 signaling pathway. Therefore, the leptin/ACAT2 axis may represent an attractive therapeutic target for breast cancer, particularly in postmenopausal and/or obese women.",

    "title": "Transendothelial movement of adiponectin is restricted by glucocorticoids.",
    "abstract": "Altered permeability of the endothelial barrier in a variety of tissues has implications both in disease pathogenesis and treatment. Glucocorticoids are potent mediators of endothelial permeability, and this forms the basis for their heavily prescribed use as medications to treat ocular disease. However, the effect of glucocorticoids on endothelial barriers elsewhere in the body is less well studied. Here, we investigated glucocorticoid-mediated changes in endothelial flux of Adiponectin (Ad), a hormone with a critical role in diabetes. First, we used monolayers of endothelial cells in vitro and found that the glucocorticoid dexamethasone increased transendothelial electrical resistance and reduced permeability of polyethylene glycol (PEG, molecular weight 4000&#x2009;Da). Dexamethasone reduced flux of Ad from the apical to basolateral side, measured both by ELISA and Western blotting. We then examined a diabetic rat model induced by treatment with exogenous corticosterone, which was characterized by glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia. There was no change in circulating Ad but less Ad protein in skeletal muscle homogenates, despite slightly higher mRNA levels, in diabetic vs control muscles. Dexamethasone-induced changes in Ad flux across endothelial monolayers were associated with alterations in the abundance of select claudin tight junction (TJ) proteins. shRNA-mediated knockdown of one such gene, claudin-7, in HUVEC resulted in decreased TEER and increased adiponectin flux, confirming the functional significance of Dex-induced changes in its expression. In conclusion, our study identifies glucocorticoid-mediated reductions in flux of Ad across endothelial monolayers in vivo and in vitro This suggests that impaired Ad action in target tissues, as a consequence of reduced transendothelial flux, may contribute to the glucocorticoid-induced diabetic phenotype.",

    "title": "Adiponectin is an endogenous anti-fibrotic mediator and therapeutic target.",
    "abstract": "Skin fibrosis in systemic sclerosis (SSc) is accompanied by attrition of dermal white adipose tissue (dWAT) and reduced levels of circulating adiponectin. Since adiponectin has potent regulatory effects on fibroblasts, we sought to assess adiponectin signaling in SSc skin biopsies, and evaluate fibrosis in mice with adiponectin gain- and loss-of-function mutations. Furthermore, we investigated the effects and mechanism of action of agonist peptides targeting adiponectin receptors in vitro and in vivo. We found that adiponectin pathway activity was significantly reduced in a subset of SSc skin biopsies. Mice lacking adiponectin mounted an exaggerated dermal fibrotic response, while transgenic mice with constitutively elevated adiponectin showed selective dWAT expansion and protection from skin and peritoneal fibrosis. Adiponectin receptor agonists abrogated ex vivo fibrotic responses in explanted normal and SSc fibroblasts and in 3D human skin equivalents, in part by attenuating focal adhesion complex assembly, and prevented and reversed experimentally-induced organ fibrosis in mice. These results implicate aberrant adiponectin pathway activity in skin fibrosis, identifying a novel function for this pleiotropic adipokine in regulation of tissue remodeling. Restoring adiponectin signaling in SSc patients therefore might represent an innovative pharmacological strategy for intractable organ fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "The expression of NILCO molecules (Notch, IL-1, and leptin crosstalk outcome) and the association with obesity were investigated in types I and II endometrial cancer (EmCa). Additionally, the involvement of NILCO in leptin-induced invasiveness of EmCa cells was investigated. The expression of NILCO mRNAs and proteins were analyzed in EmCa from African-American (n = 29) and Chinese patients (tissue array, n = 120 cases). The role of NILCO in leptin-induced invasion of Ishikawa and An3ca EmCa cells was investigated using Notch, IL-1, and leptin signaling inhibitors. NILCO molecules were expressed higher in type II EmCa, regardless of ethnic background or obesity status of patients. NILCO proteins were mainly localized in the cellular membrane and cytoplasm of type II EmCa. Additionally, EmCa from obese African-American patients showed higher levels of NILCO molecules than EmCa from lean patients. Notably, leptin-induced EmCa cell invasion was abrogated by NILCO inhibitors. Type II EmCa expressed higher NILCO molecules, which may suggest it is involved in the progression of the more aggressive EmCa phenotype. Obesity was associated with higher expression of NILCO molecules in EmCa. Leptin-induced cell invasion was dependent on NILCO. Hence, NILCO might be involved in tumor progression and could represent a new target/biomarker for type II EmCa.",

    "title": "Adiponectin, a Therapeutic Target for Obesity, Diabetes, and Endothelial Dysfunction.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin is the most abundant peptide secreted by adipocytes, whose reduction plays a central role in obesity-related diseases, including insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In addition to adipocytes, other cell types, such as skeletal and cardiac myocytes and endothelial cells, can also produce this adipocytokine. Adiponectin effects are mediated by adiponectin receptors, which occur as two isoforms (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2). Adiponectin has direct actions in liver, skeletal muscle, and the vasculature.Adiponectin exists in the circulation as varying molecular weight forms, produced by multimerization. Several endoplasmic reticulum ER-associated proteins, including ER oxidoreductase 1-&#x3b1; (Ero1-&#x3b1;), ER resident protein 44 (ERp44), disulfide-bond A oxidoreductase-like protein (DsbA-L), and glucose-regulated protein 94 (GPR94), have recently been found to be involved in the assembly and secretion of higher-order adiponectin complexes. Recent data indicate that the high-molecular weight (HMW) complexes have the predominant action in metabolic tissues. Studies have shown that adiponectin administration in humans and rodents has insulin-sensitizing, anti-atherogenic, and anti-inflammatory effects, and, in certain settings, also decreases body weight. Therefore, adiponectin replacement therapy in humans may suggest potential versatile therapeutic targets in the treatment of obesity, insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis. The current knowledge on regulation and function of adiponectin in obesity, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular disease is summarized in this review.",

    "title": "Adipokines and free fatty acids regulate insulin sensitivity by increasing microRNA-21 expression in human mature adipocytes.",
    "abstract": "Obesity is a global public health concern and may lead to a variety of complications. Previous studies have indicated that adipokines and energy&#x2011;source materials contribute to obesity and obesity&#x2011;associated insulin resistance. MicroRNAs (miRs) are endogenous 20&#x2011; to 25&#x2011;nucleotide non&#x2011;coding RNAs associated with fat metabolism. It has been indicated that miR&#x2011;21 is associated with adipogenesis and metabolic syndrome. In the present study, the expression of miR&#x2011;21 in human mature adipocytes was analyzed using reverse transcription quantitative&#x2011;polymerase chain reaction following treatment with adipokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)&#x2011;&#x3b1;, interleukin (IL)&#x2011;6, leptin, resistin and energy source materials, including free fatty acids (FFAs) and glucose. The current study demonstrated that the expression of miR&#x2011;21 in human mature adipocytes was upregulated following treatment with TNF&#x2011;&#x3b1;, IL&#x2011;6, leptin, resistin and FFAs. However, low&#x2011; and high&#x2011;glucose did not have an effect on miR&#x2011;21 expression. These results confirmed that TNF&#x2011;&#x3b1;, IL&#x2011;6, leptin, resistin and FFAs may contribute to obesity and obesity&#x2011;associated insulin resistance via upregulating miR&#x2011;21 in human mature adipocytes. Therefore, miR&#x2011;21 may be a key regulatory factor of obesity and obesity&#x2011;associated insulin resistance, and represents a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of these disorders.",

    "abstract": "Chemerin is an adipokine that induces insulin resistance by the mechanism of inflammation in adipose tissue but these are still unclear. A high level of chemerin in humans is considered as a marker of inflammation in insulin resistance and obesity as well as in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Despite the role of chemerin in insulin resistance progression, chemerin as one of the novel adipokines is proposed to be involved in high cancer risk and mortality. The aim of this paper was to review the role of CMKLR-1 receptor and the potential therapeutic target in the management of chemerin induced type 2 diabetes mellitus and cancer. Increased chemerin secretion activates an inflammatory response. The inflammatory response will increase the oxidative stress in adipose tissue and consequently results in an insulin-resistant state. The occurrence of inflammation, oxidative stress and insulin resistance leads to the progression of cancers. Chemerin is one of the markers that may involve in development of both cancer and insulin resistance. Chemokine like receptor- 1 (CMKLR-1) receptor that regulates chemerin levels exhibits a potential therapeutic target for insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the effects of high-fructose-high-fat diets with different fat compositions on metabolic parameters, hippocampal-dependent cognitive function, and brain leptin (as well as stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1) mRNA expressions). Thirty-two male Wistar rats were divided into 3 groups, a control group (n = 8), a high-fructose soybean oil group (37.5% of fat calories, n = 12), and a high-fructose coconut oil group (37.5% of fat calories, n = 12) for 20 weeks. By the end of the study, the coconut oil group exhibited significantly higher serum fasting glucose, fructosamine, insulin, leptin, and triglyceride levels compared to those of the control and soybean oil groups. However, hippocampal leptin expression and leptin receptor mRNA levels were significantly lower, while SCD1 mRNA was significantly higher in rats fed the high-fructose-high-coconut oil diet than in rats fed the other experimental diets. In addition, the coconut oil group spent significantly less time in the target quadrant on the probe test in the Morris water maze (MWM) task. Rats fed the high-fructose-high-coconut oil diet for 20 weeks were prone to develop hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, hyperleptinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. These metabolic consequences may contribute to hippocampal-dependent memory impairment, accompanied by a lower central leptin level, and a higher SCD1 gene expression in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Although the Apiaceae herb family has been traditionally used for the management of type 2 diabetes, its molecular mechanism has not been clarified. Coumarin derivatives, which are abundant in plants of the Apiaceae family, were evaluated for their effects on adipogenesis. We found that suksdorfin significantly promoted adipocyte differentiation and enhanced production of adiponectin, an anti-diabetic adipokine. We also demonstrated that suksdorfin activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR&#x3b3;), a master regulator of adipogenesis. Furthermore, we showed metabolic disorders in obese diabetic KK-A<sup>y</sup> mice were attenuated by suksdorfin feeding. Suksdorfin intake induced adipocyte miniaturization and increased expression levels of PPAR&#x3b3; target genes related to adipocyte differentiation. These results indicated that suksdorfin induces adipogenesis in white adipose tissue (WAT) via the activation of PPAR&#x3b3;, leading to improvement of obesity-induced metabolic disorders. Therefore, suksdorfin-mediated amelioration of WAT dysfunctions might be responsible for the anti-diabetic effects of traditional herbal medicine therapy with Apiaceae.",

    "abstract": "The oxidative phosphorylation system is important for adipocyte differentiation. Therefore, xenobiotics inhibitors of the oxidative phosphorylation system could affect adipocyte differentiation and adipokine secretion. As adipokines impact the overall health status, these xenobiotics may have wide effects on human health. Some of these xenobiotics are widely used therapeutic drugs, such as ribosomal antibiotics. Because of its similarity to the bacterial one, mitochondrial translation system is an off-target for these compounds. To study the influence of the ribosomal antibiotic linezolid on adipokine production, we analyzed its effects on adipocyte secretome. Linezolid, at therapeutic concentrations, modifies the levels of apolipoprotein E and several adipokines and proteins related with the extracellular matrix. This antibiotic also alters the global methylation status of human adipose tissue-derived stem cells and, therefore, its effects are not limited to the exposure period. Besides their consequences on other tissues, xenobiotics acting on the adipocyte oxidative phosphorylation system alter apolipoprotein E and adipokine production, secondarily contributing to their systemic effects.",

    "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a serious psychiatric condition characterized by excessive body weight loss and disturbed perceptions of body shape and size, often associated with excessive physical activity. There is currently no effective drug-related therapy of this disease and this leads to high relapse rate. Clinical data suggest that a promising therapy to treat and reduce reoccurrence of AN may be based on the use of drugs that target the endocannabinoid (EC) system, which appears dysregulated in AN patients. The activity-based anorexia (ABA) rodent model mimics the severe body weight loss and increased physical activity, as well as the neuroendocrine disturbances (i.e. hypoleptinaemia and hypercortisolaemia) in AN. This study investigated whether cannabinoid agonists can effectively modify anorexic-like behaviours and neuroendocrine changes in rats subjected to a repeated ABA regime that mimics the human condition in which patients repeatedly undergo a recovery and illness cycle. Our data show that subchronic treatment with both the natural CB1 /CB2 receptor agonist &#x394;<sup>9</sup> -tetrahydrocannabinol and the synthetic CB1 /CB2 receptor agonist CP-55,940 significantly reduced body weight loss and running wheel activity in ABA rats. These behavioural effects were accompanied by an increase in leptin signalling and a decrease in plasma levels of corticosterone. Taken together, our results further demonstrate the involvement of the EC system in AN pathophysiology and that strategies which modulate EC signalling are useful to treat this disorder, specifically in patients where physical hyperactivity plays a central role in its progression and maintenance.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate, in a randomized clinical trial, the effects of metformin immediate release (IR) compared with metformin extended release (XR) on the gastrointestinal tolerability and glycemic control. We enrolled 253 Caucasian patients with type 2 diabetes not well controlled by diet (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] &gt;7.0% and &lt;8.5%). Patients were randomized to metformin IR or metformin XR for a period of 6 months at the maximum tolerated dose. The average dose of metformin IR used was 2,000&#xb1;1,000 mg/day, while that of metformin XR was 1,000&#xb1;500 mg/day. We evaluated body weight, HbA1c, fasting and postprandial glucose, fasting plasma insulin (FPI) and homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), lipid profile, and levels of some adipocytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1; (TNF-&#x3b1;), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), visfatin, and vaspin. Moreover, at the baseline and after 6 months, we administered patients some validated questionnaires to assess patients' satisfaction toward treatments. After 6 months, both formulations gave a similar reduction in body weight and body mass index (BMI); however, metformin XR gave a greater improvement in glycemic control, FPI, and HOMA-IR, compared with both baseline and metformin IR. A reduction in total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was observed with metformin XR compared with IR. Levels of TNF-&#x3b1;, hs-CRP, and vaspin were reduced by metformin XR but not by the IR formulation. Metformin XR also raised the levels of visfatin. Metformin XR formulation seems to be more effective than metformin IR in improving glyco-metabolic control, lipid profile, and levels of some adipocytokines in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogels derived from adipose tissue extracellular matrix (AdECM) have shown potential in the ability to generate new adipose tissue in vivo. To further enhance adipogenesis, a composite adipose derived delivery system (CADDS) containing single- and double-walled dexamethasone encapsulated microspheres (SW and DW Dex MS) has been developed. Previously, our laboratory has published the use of Dex MS as an additive to enhance adipogenesis and angiogenesis in adipose tissue grafts. In the current work, AdECM and CADDS are extensively characterized, in addition to conducting in vitro cell culture analysis. Study results indicate the AdECM used for the CADDS has minimal cellular and lipid content allowing for gelation of its collagen structure under physiological conditions. Adipose-derived stem cell (ASC) culture studies confirmed biocompatibility with the CADDS, and adipogenesis was increased in experimental groups containing the hydrogel scaffold. In vitro studies of AdECM hydrogel containing microspheres demonstrated a controlled release of dexamethasone from SW and DW formulations. The delivery of Dex MS via an injectable hydrogel scaffold combines two biologically responsive components to develop a minimally, invasive, off-the-shelf biomaterial for adipose tissue engineering. Scientists and doctors have yet to develop an off-the-shelf product for patients with soft tissue defects. Recently, the use of adipose derived extracellular matrix (adECM) to generate new adipose tissue in vivo has shown great promise but individually, adECM still has limitations in terms of volume and consistency. The current work introduces a novel composite off-the-shelf construct comprised of an adECM-based hydrogel and dexamethasone encapsulated microspheres (Dex MS). The hydrogel construct serves not only as an injectable protein-rich scaffold but also a delivery system for the Dex MS for non-invasive application to the defect site. The methods and results presented are a progressive step forward in the field of adipose tissue engineering.",

    "abstract": "Chalcones, the biosynthetic precursors of flavonoids and isoflavonoids abundant in edible plants, possess a number of pharmacological properties, and there is growing evidence that chalcone derivatives inhibit TNF-&#x3b1; mediated insulin resistance. The aim of the present study was to define the effects of 4-methoxychalcone (4-MC) on adipocyte differentiation and to determine the underlying molecular mechanism. We investigated the effects of 4-MC on adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation, and expression of adipogenic genes in 3T3-L1 cells. Additionally, treatment with 4-MC significantly increased the PPAR&#x3b3;-induced transcriptional activity and 4-MC also enhanced the DNA binding affinity of PPAR&#x3b3; to the proliferator-activated receptor response elements (PPRE) at target promoters. Next, we tested the effect of 4-MC on the inhibition induced by TNF-&#x3b1; on adipocyte differentiation. Treatment with 4-MC enhanced the lipid accumulation and strongly up-regulated the expression of adipogenic markers, including PPAR&#x3b3;, aP2, FAS, and adiponectin during adipocyte differentiation. Finally, 4-MC attenuated the inhibitory effect of TNF-&#x3b1; on adipocyte differentiation and adiponectin expression and subsequently regulated the expression and secretion of various adipokines that are involved in insulin sensitivity. This study clearly demonstrates that 4-MC enhanced adipocyte differentiation, in part, by its potent effects on PPAR&#x3b3; activation and by its reverse effect on TNF-&#x3b1;.",

    "abstract": "Adipose tissue secretes a plethora of adipokines as evidenced by characterization of subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue secretomes. However, adipose tissue composition and secretion pattern is depot and disease dependent, influencing the adipose tissue secretome. We investigated the secretome of cancer-associated adipose tissue (CAAT) explants from breast cancer patients and explored its role in breast cancer proliferation. CAAT proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS and human protein antibody arrays and stimulated proliferation of three breast cancer cell lines. Kinomics and transcriptomics of MCF-7 breast cancer cells treated with the secretome of CAAT revealed activation of Akt-, ERK- and JNK-pathways and differential expression of activator protein 1 (AP-1) and cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB) target genes. The cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4/6-inhibitor palbociclib significantly abrogated CAAT-enhanced breast cancer cell proliferation. Our work characterizes the specific breast CAAT protein secretome and reveals its pro-proliferative potency in breast cancer.",

    "title": "Adiponectin down-regulates CREB and inhibits proliferation of A549 lung cancer cells.",
    "abstract": "Adipokines are known to play a relevant role in a number of cancer related molecular pathways. Adiponectin is a major adipokine with anti-inflammatory and beneficial metabolic actions. Furthermore, it has been shown to exert anti-carcinogenic effects in various tumor models and some clinical studies suggested an inverse relationship between circulating levels of adiponectin and an increased risk for development of malignancies. On the other hand, the cyclic AMP response element binding (CREB) transcription factor has been clearly linked to lung cancer. we analyzed cell proliferation, cell cycle of A549&#xa0;cells treated with adiponectin as well as CREB activation status in human lung adenocarcinoma A549&#xa0;cells and in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples. adiponectin treatment, at concentrations ranging between 5 and 50&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/ml mimicking human serum levels, has a significant effect on reducing tumor cell proliferation of A549&#xa0;cells, mainly by altering cell cycle progression. Importantly, we provide evidence that adiponectin clearly inhibits in a dose- and time-dependent manner CREB phosphorylation (activation) and, at least in part, also the level of CREB protein itself, preceding and accompanying the anti-proliferative effects in response to adiponectin. Moreover, in agreement with previous studies demonstrating that CREB over-expression occurs in many tumors, we also show by western-blotting from lung specimen that CREB is significantly up-regulated in NSCLC samples compared to adjacent normal tissues from six patients. Overall, our results represent the first evidence of CREB inhibition by adiponectin and may provide new insight into therapeutic strategies for lung cancer.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin (APN) is an adipokine with anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects. In this study, the therapeutic effect of APN gene delivery using a polymeric carrier was evaluated in an acute lung injury (ALI) model. Polyethylenimine (2 kDa, PEI2K), PEI25K (25 kDa), polyamidoamine (generation 2, PAMG2), dexamethasone-conjugated PEI2k (PEI2K-Dexa), and dexamethasone-conjugated PAMG2 (PAMG2-Dexa) were evaluated in vitro and in vivo as gene carriers. Formation of plasmid DNA (pDNA)/carrier complexes was confirmed by gel retardation and heparin competition assays. Delivery efficiency was measured by a luciferase assay and fluorescence microscopy. In an ALI animal model, pAPN/carrier complexes were delivered by intratracheal administration. Therapeutic effects were evaluated by cytokine assays and hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining. Gel retardation assays showed that PEI2K-Dexa and PAMG2-Dexa formed complexes with pDNA. In L2 lung epithelial cells, PAMG2-Dexa yielded higher transfection efficiency than PEI2K, PAMG2, PEI25K, lipofectamine, and PEI2K-Dexa. In vivo experiments showed that PAMG2-Dexa delivered DNA more efficiently to lung tissue than PEI2K-Dexa and PEI25K. Delivery of pAPN/PAMG2-Dexa complexes upregulated APN expression in the lungs of mice with ALI. As a result, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x3b1; and IL-1&#x3b2; were decreased. H&amp;E staining showed that inflammation in the lungs of mice with ALI was reduced by delivery of the APN gene. Delivery of the APN gene using PAMG2-Dexa reduced inflammation in the lungs of mice with ALI. The APN gene could be a useful tool in the development of gene therapy for ALI.",

    "abstract": "A hallmark of bone marrow changes with aging is the increase in adipocyte composition, but how this impacts development of multiple myeloma (MM) is unknown. Here, we report the role of the adipokine leptin as master regulator of anti-myeloma tumor immunity by modulating the invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cell function. A marked increase in serum leptin levels and leptin receptor (LR) expression on iNKT cells in MM patients and the 5T33 murine MM model was observed. MM cells and leptin synergistically counteracted anti-tumor functionality of both murine and human iNKT cells. In vivo blockade of LR signaling combined with iNKT stimulation resulted in superior anti-tumor protection. This was linked to persistent IFN-&#x3b3; secretion upon repeated iNKT cell stimulation and a restoration of the dynamic antigen-induced motility arrest as observed by intravital microscopy, thereby showing alleviation of iNKT cell anergy. Overall our data reveal the LR axis as novel therapeutic target for checkpoint inhibition to treat MM.",

    "title": "Adiponectin Enhances Quiescence Exit of Murine Hematopoietic Stem Cells and Hematopoietic Recovery Through mTORC1 Potentiation.",
    "abstract": "Myelotoxic injury, such as chemotherapeutic agents and ionizing radiation, unlocks the vigorous power of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to replenish the hematopoietic system, making quiescent HSCs enter the cell cycle. Considering that both HSC-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms enforce quiescence of HSCs, the drastic change in bone marrow (BM) environment after injury, represented by massive expansion of BM adipocytes, might trigger HSC activation. BM adipocytes, the major cellular component in the ablated marrow, however, reportedly suppress proliferation of hematopoietic cells, which may indicate the BM adipocytogenesis is an irrational response of injured organism. Given that adipose tissue is an endocrine organ with pleiotropic functions, we hypothesized that adipocyte-derived factors, especially adiponectin, an anti-inflammatory adipokine involved in regulation of granulopoiesis, are implicated in HSC activation. Myeloablative intervention increased BM adiponectin by multiple mechanisms, including adipocyte expansion and increased diffusion from the blood. Adiponectin-null (Adipoq <sup>-/-</sup> ) mice showed delayed hematopoietic recovery after BM injury, with Adipoq<sup>-/-</sup> HSCs more quiescent and defective in mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activation. Recombinant adiponectin promoted not only HSC activation in vivo but cytokine-induced activation in vitro, and shortened the time for exit from quiescence in an mTORC1-dependent manner. These data illustrate a scarcely-reported example of a cell-extrinsic factor, adiponectin, enhancing quiescence exit of HSCs, and subsequent hematopoietic recovery. Our findings also highlight adipocytes as a source of adiponectin to ensure the proliferative burst of hematopoietic cells in ablated marrow. Stem Cells 2017;35:1835-1848.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin is an adipokine with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiatherogenic, pro-angiogenic, vasoprotective and insulin-sensitizing properties. Several factors may influence adiponectin levels, such as genetic polymorphisms, obesity / body fat distribution, diet and exercise as well as cardiovascular risk factors such as sleep deprivation and smoking as well as medications. Adiponectin has been proposed as a potential prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target in patients with cardiometabolic diseases. This narrative review discusses the associations of adiponectin with obesity-related metabolic disorders (metabolic syndrome, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, hyperuricaemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus). We also focus on the links between adiponectin and lipid disorders and with coronary heart disease and noncardiac vascular diseases (i.e. stroke, peripheral artery disease, carotid artery disease, atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, abdominal aortic aneurysms and chronic kidney disease). Further, the effects of lifestyle interventions and drug therapy on adiponectin levels are briefly reviewed. Based on available data, adiponectin represents a multifaceted biomarker that may beneficially affect atherosclerosis, inflammation and insulin resistance pathways. However, there are conflicting results with regard to the associations between adiponectin levels and the prevalence and outcomes of cardiometabolic diseases. Further research on the potential clinical implications of adiponectin in the diagnosis and treatment of such diseases is needed.",

    "abstract": "Characterising the molecular networks that negatively regulate pancreatic &#x3b2;-cell function is essential for understanding the underlying pathogenesis and developing new treatment strategies for type 2 diabetes. We recently identified serine/threonine protein kinase 25 (STK25) as a critical regulator of ectopic fat storage, meta-inflammation, and fibrosis in liver and skeletal muscle. Here, we assessed the role of STK25 in control of progression of non-alcoholic fatty pancreas disease in the context of chronic exposure to dietary lipids in mice. We found that overexpression of STK25 in high-fat-fed transgenic mice aggravated diet-induced lipid storage in the pancreas compared with that of wild-type controls, which was accompanied by exacerbated pancreatic inflammatory cell infiltration, stellate cell activation, fibrosis and apoptosis. Pancreas of Stk25 transgenic mice also displayed a marked decrease in islet &#x3b2;/&#x3b1;-cell ratio and alteration in the islet architecture with an increased presence of &#x3b1;-cells within the islet core, whereas islet size remained similar between genotypes. After a continued challenge with a high-fat diet, lower levels of fasting plasma insulin and C-peptide, and higher levels of plasma leptin, were detected in Stk25 transgenic vs wild-type mice. Furthermore, the glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was impaired in high-fat-fed Stk25 transgenic mice during glucose tolerance test, in spite of higher net change in blood glucose concentrations compared with wild-type controls, suggesting islet &#x3b2;-cell dysfunction. In summary, this study unravels a role for STK25 in determining the susceptibility to diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty pancreas disease in mice in connection to obesity. Our findings highlight STK25 as a potential drug target for metabolic disease.",

    "title": "Novel lipid-mimetic prodrugs delivering active compounds to adipose tissue.",
    "abstract": "Obesity and associated pathologies are a dramatically growing problem. New therapies to prevent and/or cure them are strongly needed. Adipose tissue is a logical target for pharmacological intervention, since it is now recognized to exert an important endocrine function, secreting a variety of adipokines affecting, for example, adiposity and insulin resistance. This proof of principle work focuses on the development of novel lipid-mimetic prodrugs reaching fat deposits by the same lymphatic absorption route followed by dietary triglycerides. Pterostilbene, a natural phenolic compound with potential anti-obesity effects, was used as model cargo, attached via a carbamate group to an &#x3c9;-aminodecanoate chain linked to either position 1 or position 2 of the glycerol moiety of synthetic triglycerides. The prodrugs underwent position-selective hydrolysis when challenged with pancreatic lipases in&#xa0;vitro. Pterostilbene-containing triglycerides as well as pterostilbene and its metabolites were present in the adipose tissue of mice fed an obesogenic diet containing one or the other of the derivatives. For the first time this approach is used to deliver an obesity antagonist to the adipose tissue. The results demonstrate the feasibility of delivering active compounds to adipose tissue by reversibly incorporating them into triglyceride-mimetic structures. Upon release in the target site these compounds are expected to exert their pharmacological activity precisely where needed.",

    "abstract": "Leptin, an adipocyte-derived cytokine associated with bone metabolism, is believed to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of heterotopic ossification (HO). The effect and underlying action mechanism of leptin were investigated on osteogenic differentiation of tendon-derived stem cells (TDSCs) in vitro and the HO formation in rat tendons. Isolated rat TDSCs were treated with various concentrations of leptin in the presence or absence of mTORC1 signaling specific inhibitor rapamycin in vitro. A rat model with Achilles tenotomy was employed to evaluate the effect of leptin on HO formation together with or without rapamycin treatment. In vitro studies with TDSCs showed that leptin increased the expression of osteogenic biomarkers (alkaline phosphatase, runt-related transcription factor 2, osterix, osteocalcin) and enhanced mineralization of TDSCs via activating the mTORC1 signal pathway (as indicated by phosphorylation of p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 and p70 ribosomal S6). However, mTORC1 signaling blockade with rapamycin treatment suppressed leptin-induced osteogenic differentiation and mineralization. In vivo studies showed that leptin promoted HO formation in the Achilles tendon after tenotomy, and rapamycin treatment blocked leptin-induced HO formation. In conclusion, leptin can promote TDSC osteogenic differentiation and heterotopic bone formation via mTORC1 signaling in both vitro and vivo model, which provides a new potential therapeutic target for HO prevention.",

    "abstract": "to assess the potential of fixed perindopril/indapamide combination (FPIC) to improve angioprotection in patients with arterial hypertension (AP) with various efficacy of preceding therapy with combination of losartan and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). We included in this open study 50 patients with AP divided into two equal-sized groups in dependence on the achievement of target blood pressure (BP) less than 140/90 mm Hg on preceding therapy with losartan (100 mg) and HCTZ (12.5 mg). All patients underwent ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM), applanation tonometry (assessment of augmentation index and central blood pressure), measurement of pulse wave velocity (PWV), laboratory tests (lipid profile, fasting glucose, HOMA index, homocysteine, leptin, adiponectin, high sensitivity C reactive protein [hsCRP]). Study duration was 12 weeks. Treatment with FPIC in patients not at target BP provided 14.5 and 6.6% reduction of systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP), respectively (p&lt;0.01), while in patients with target BP it was associated with additional reductions of SBP and DBP by 3.9 and 5.4%, respectively (p&lt;0.01). According to ABPM data average day- and nighttime SBP decreased by 16.9 and 15.0%, average day- and nighttime DBP - by 10.6 and 13.6% (p&lt;0.01) in the group of patients not at target BP. Reductions of PWV (by 15.2 and 2.2%), augmentation index (by 10.7 and 9.4%), central SBP (by 10.9 and 2.1%), central pulse BP vascular age (by 8.7 and 6.0%) were observed in groups of patients without and with target BP on preceding therapy, respectively (p&lt;0.01). Leptin level decreased by 10.0 and 14.4%, hsCRP - by 17.7 and 11.0%; while level of adiponectin increased by 6.7 and 9.9% (p&lt;0.01).

    "abstract": "Background: Obesity is associated with hyperleptinemia and endothelial dysfunction. Hyperleptinemia has been reported to induce both oxidative stress and inflammation by increasing reactive oxygen species production.Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the effects of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [1,25(OH)2D3] against leptin-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in human endothelial cells.Methods: Small interfering RNA (siRNA) were used to knock down the expression of vitamin D receptor (VDR) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). HUVECs were pretreated for 4 h with physiologic (10<sup>-10</sup> M) or supraphysiologic (10<sup>-7</sup> M) concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D3 and exposed to leptin (10 ng/mL). Superoxide anion production and translocation of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2) and nuclear transcription factor &#x3ba;B (NF-&#x3ba;B) subunit p65 to the nucleus and the activation of their target genes were quantified.Results: Pretreatment of HUVECs with 1,25(OH)2D3 prevented the leptin-induced increase in superoxide anion production (P &lt; 0.05). Pretreatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 further increased NRF2 translocation to the nucleus (by 3-fold; P &lt; 0.05) and increased mRNA expression of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2; by 2-fold), glutathione peroxidase (GPX; by 3-fold), NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone) 1 (NQO1; by 4-fold), and heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1; by 2-fold) (P &lt; 0.05). Leptin doubled the translocation of NF-&#x3ba;B (P &lt; 0.05) to the nucleus and increased (P &lt; 0.05) the upregulation of vascular inflammatory mediators such as monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1; by 1-fold), transforming growth factor &#x3b2; (TGF &#x3b2; by 1-fold), and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1; by 4-fold) (P &lt; 0.05), which were prevented (P &lt; 0.05) by pretreatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 Protective effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 were confirmed to be VDR dependent by using VDR siRNA.Conclusion: Pretreatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 in the presence of a high concentration of leptin has a beneficial effect on HUVECs through the regulation of mediators of antioxidant activity and inflammation.",

    "abstract": "The C1q complement/TNF-related protein (CTRP) superfamily, which includes the adipokine adiponectin, has been shown in animal models to have positive metabolic and cardiovascular effects. We sought to investigate circulating CTRP1, CTRP9, CTRP12 and CTRP13 concentrations in persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with age and BMI matched controls, and to examine the effects of a 2 hour 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) on serum CTRP1, CTRP9, CTRP12 and CTRP13 levels in persons with T2DM. Cross-sectional study [newly diagnosed T2DM (n = 124) and control (n = 139) participants]. Serum CTRP1, CTRP9, CTRP12 and CTRP13 were measured by ELISA. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol (TCH), Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, triglycerides, TCH/High-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio, triglycerides/HDL ratio, glucose, insulin, homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), C-reactive protein and endothelial lipase were significantly higher, whereas leptin and adiponectin were significantly lower in T2DM participants. Serum CTRP1 were significantly higher and CTRP12 significantly lower in T2DM participants. Age, diastolic blood pressure, glucose and CTRP12 were predictive of serum CTRP1; leptin was predictive of serum CTRP9; glucose and CTRP1 were predictive of serum CTRP12; endothelial lipase was predictive of serum CTRP13. Finally, serum CTRP1 were significantly higher and CTRP12 significantly lower in T2DM participants after a 2 hour 75g OGTT. Our data supports CTRP1 and CTRP12 as potential novel biomarkers for the prediction and early diagnosis of T2DM. Furthermore, pharmacological agents that target CTRP1 and CTRP12 could represent a new strategy in the treatment of T2DM.",

    "title": "The role of adiponectin receptors in the regulation of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus.",
    "abstract": "In the last two decades adiponectin, member of the adipokines family, gained attention because of its unique antidiabetic effects. However, the presence in the brain of adiponectin receptors and adiponectin itself raised interest because of the possible association with neuropsychiatric diseases. Indeed, clinical studies found altered concentration of adiponectin both in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid in several pathologies including depression, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and stroke. Moreover, recent preclinical studies also suggest its involvement in different physiological functions. Despite this evidence very few studies attempted to elucidate the functional role of adiponectin at the synapse. To address this question, here we investigated the effect of Adiporon, an agonist of both adiponectin receptors on synaptic transmission and LTP at Schaffer-collateral CA1 pathway. Surprisingly, increasing concentration of Adiporon correlated with lower CA1-LTP levels and paired-pulse ratio, whereas basal transmission was always preserved. Collectively, our data show that the adiponectin system, beyond its involvement in metabolic diseases, plays also a critical role in synaptic activity thereby representing a putative target for the treatment of synaptic pathologies.",

    "abstract": "Adipokines are bioactive proteins that mediate proliferation, metabolism, inflammation, and angiogenesis. Adiponectin is an important adipokine that exerts multiple key functions via its anti-metabolic syndrome and anti-inflammatory properties. A number of adiponectin receptors, AdipoR1, AdipoR2 and T-cadherin, have been identified. Recent studies have suggested the involvement of adiponectin and receptors in several cancers, including prostate, breast, endometrial, brain, and colon cancer. Altered levels of adiponectin expression, or its interacting receptors, in cancers can lead to dysregulation of signaling pathways. Our current review describes the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-tumorigenesis activity of adiponectin and the role of its receptors in prostate carcinogenesis, and provides perspectives of adiponectin-mediated signaling as a potential target for therapy.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic and metabolic disorder affecting large set of population of the world. To widen the scope of understanding of genetic causes of this disease, we performed interactive and toxicogenomic based systems biology study to find potential T2DM related genes after cDNA differential analysis. Methods: From the list of 50-differential expressed genes (p &lt; 0.05), we found 9-T2DM related genes using extensive data mapping. In our constructed gene-network, T2DM-related differentially expressed seeder genes (9-genes) are found to interact with functionally related gene signatures (31-genes). The genetic interaction network of both T2DM-associated seeder as well as signature genes generally relates well with the disease condition based on toxicogenomic and data curation. Results: These networks showed significant enrichment of insulin signaling, insulin secretion and other T2DM-related pathways including JAK-STAT, MAPK, TGF, Toll-like receptor, p53 and mTOR, adipocytokine, FOXO, PPAR, P13-AKT, and triglyceride metabolic pathways. We found some enriched pathways that are common in different conditions. We recognized 11-signaling pathways as a connecting link between gene signatures in insulin resistance and T2DM. Notably, in the drug-gene network, the interacting genes showed significant overlap with 13-FDA approved and few non-approved drugs. This study demonstrates the value of systems genetics for identifying 18 potential genes associated with T2DM that are probable drug targets. Conclusions: This integrative and network based approaches for finding variants in genomic data expect to accelerate identification of new drug target molecules for different diseases and can speed up drug discovery outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin (APN) is known to promote the osteogenic differentiation of human jaw bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (h-JBMMSCs). However, the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Previously, we showed that APN could promote h-JBMMSC osteogenesis via APPL1-p38 by up-regulating osteogenesis-related genes. Here, we aimed to determine whether APN could promote h-JBMMSC chemotaxis through CXCL1/CXCL8. The CCK-8, wound healing and transwell assays were used to evaluate the proliferation, migration and chemotaxis of h-JBMMSCs with or without APN treatment. Chemotaxis-related genes were screened using RNA-seq, and the results were validated using real-time PCR and ELISA. We also performed Western blot using the AMPK inhibitor, WZ4003, and the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, to identify the signalling pathway involved. We found that APN could promote h-JBMMSC chemotaxis in the co-culture transwell system. CXCL1 and CXCL8 were screened and confirmed as the up-regulated target genes. The APN-induced CXCL1/8 up-regulation to promote chemotaxis could be blocked by CXCR2 inhibitor SB225002. Western blot revealed that the phosphorylation of AMPK and p38 MAPK increased in a time-dependent manner with APN treatment. Additionally, WZ4003 and SB203580 could suppress the APN-induced overexpression of CXCL1 and CXCL8. The results of the transwell chemotaxis assay also supported the above results. Our data suggest that APN can promote h-JBMMSC chemotaxis by up-regulating CXCL1 and CXCL8.",

    "title": "Treatment of obese asthma in a mouse model by simvastatin is associated with improving dyslipidemia and decreasing leptin level.",
    "abstract": "Obesity can cause or worsen asthma. Compared with common asthma, obese asthma is difficult to control. Statins are effective serum cholesterol-lowering agents in clinical practice, and they also have anti-inflammatory properties, which in theory are potentially beneficial in asthma. Many studies have shown that simvastatin has good therapeutic effect in animal models of asthma. However, the therapeutic effect and action mechanism of simvastatin for obese asthma remain unclear. Leptin, a satiety hormone, is in positive correlation with total body fat mass and may also play a significant role in the pathogenesis of asthma. In this study, we use the method of high-fat diet and ovalbumin (OVA) sensitization and challenge to establish the mouse model of obesity and asthma, and find that obese asthmatic mice has higher levels of glucose, lipid and leptin in serum, and neutrophil percentage in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and more severe airway inflammation and structural changes in lung tissues than non-obese asthmatic mice, and respond poorly to dexamethasone treatment, which indicates that obese asthma might belong to steroid-resistant (SR) asthma. Simvastatin treatment reduces the levels of glucose, lipid, leptin and neutrophil percentage, and improves airway inflammation and remodeling, which can be as a potential therapeutic target used in the treatment of obese asthma in humans. Correlation analysis shows that there is positive correlation between neutrophil percentage and serum leptin/cholesterol level, which indicates that the therapeutic efficacy of simvastatin on obese asthma might be associated with improving dyslipidemia and decreasing leptin level.",

    "abstract": "Stroke is a multifactorial disease contributing to significant noncommunicable disease burden in developing countries. Risk of stroke is largely a consequence of morbidities of diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and heart diseases. Incidence of stroke is directly proportional to body mass index. Adipose tissue stores energy as well as acts as an active endocrine organ, which secretes numerous humoral factors. Adiponectin and leptin are the commonest adipocytokines and have been invariably linked to the development of coronary heart disease and may be involved in the underlying biological mechanism of stroke. Leptin and adiponectin mediate proatherogenic and antiatherogenic responses, respectively, and hence, determining the plasma or serum levels of leptin and adiponectin alone or in combination may act as a novel prognostic biomarker for inflammation and atherosclerosis in stroke. This review addresses leptin- and adiponectin-mediated inflammatory mechanism in ischemic stroke and their potential as therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. Studies have demonstrated that anthocyanin-rich foods may improve hyperlipidemia and ameliorate hepatic steatosis. Here, effects of Aronia melanocarpa (AM), known to be rich of anthocyanins, on hepatic lipid metabolism and adipogenic genes were determined. AM was treated to C57BL/6N mice fed with high fat diet (HFD) or to FL83B cells treated with free fatty acid (FFA). Changes in levels of lipids, enzymes and hormones were observed, and expressions of adipogenic genes involved in hepatic lipid metabolism were detected by PCR, Western blotting and luciferase assay. In mice, AM significantly reduced the body and liver weight, lipid accumulation in the liver, and levels of biochemical markers such as fatty acid synthase, hepatic triglyceride and leptin. Serum transaminases, indicators for hepatocyte injury, were also suppressed, while superoxide dismutase activity and liver antioxidant capacity were significantly increased. In FL83B cells, AM significantly reduced FFA-induced lipid droplet accumulation. Protein synthesis of an adipogenic transcription factor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x3b3;2 (PPAR&#x3b3;2) was inhibited in vivo. Furthermore, transcriptional activity of PPAR&#x3b3;2 was down-regulated in vitro, and mRNA expression of PPAR&#x3b3;2 and its downstream target genes, adipocyte protein 2 and lipoprotein lipase were down-regulated by AM both in vitro and in vivo. These results show beneficial effects of AM against hepatic lipid accumulation through the inhibition of PPAR&#x3b3;2 expression along with improvements in body weight, liver functions, lipid profiles and antioxidant capacity suggesting the potential therapeutic efficacy of AM on NAFLD.",

    "title": "A Small Insulinomimetic Molecule Also Improves Insulin Sensitivity in Diabetic Mice.",
    "abstract": "Dramatic increase of diabetes over the globe is in tandem with the increase in insulin requirement. This is because destruction and dysfunction of pancreatic &#x3b2;-cells are of common occurrence in both Type1 diabetes and Type2 diabetes, and insulin injection becomes a compulsion. Because of several problems associated with insulin injection, orally active insulin mimetic compounds would be ideal substitute. Here we report a small molecule, a peroxyvanadate compound i.e. DmpzH[VO(O2)2(dmpz)], henceforth referred as dmp, which specifically binds to insulin receptor with considerable affinity (KD-1.17&#x3bc;M) thus activating insulin receptor tyrosine kinase and its downstream signaling molecules resulting increased uptake of [14C] 2 Deoxy-glucose. Oral administration of dmp to streptozotocin treated BALB/c mice lowers blood glucose level and markedly stimulates glucose and fatty acid uptake by skeletal muscle and adipose tissue respectively. In db/db mice, it greatly improves insulin sensitivity through excess expression of PPAR&#x3b3; and its target genes i.e. adiponectin, CD36 and aP2. Study on the underlying mechanism demonstrated that excess expression of Wnt3a decreased PPAR&#x3b3; whereas dmp suppression of Wnt3a gene increased PPAR&#x3b3; expression which subsequently augmented adiponectin. Increased production of adiponectin in db/db mice due to dmp effected lowering of circulatory TG and FFA levels, activates AMPK in skeletal muscle and this stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis and bioenergetics. Decrease of lipid load along with increased mitochondrial activity greatly improves energy homeostasis which has been found to be correlated with the increased insulin sensitivity. The results obtained with dmp, therefore, strongly indicate that dmp could be a potential candidate for insulin replacement therapy.",

    "abstract": "In insulin and leptin signaling pathway, Protein-Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) plays a crucial controlling role as a negative regulator, which makes it an attractive therapeutic target for both Type-2 Diabetes (T2D) and obesity. In this work, we have generated classification models by using the inhibition data set of known PTP1B inhibitors to identify new inhibitors of PTP1B utilizing multiple machine learning techniques like na&#xef;ve Bayesian, random forest, support vector machine and k-nearest neighbors, along with structural fingerprints and selected molecular descriptors. Several models from each algorithm have been constructed and optimized, with the different combination of molecular descriptors and structural fingerprints. For the training and test sets, most of the predictive models showed more than 90% of overall prediction accuracies. The best model was obtained with support vector machine approach and has Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 0.82 for the external test set, which was further employed for the virtual screening of Maybridge small compound database. Five compounds were subsequently selected for experimental assay. Out of these two compounds were found to inhibit PTP1B with significant inhibitory activity in in-vitro inhibition assay. The structural fragments which are important for PTP1B inhibition were identified by na&#xef;ve Bayesian method and can be further exploited to design new molecules around the identified scaffolds. The descriptive and predictive modeling strategy applied in this study is capable of identifying PTP1B inhibitors from the large compound libraries.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer (PC) shows a high death rate. PC incidence and prognosis are affected by obesity, a pandemic characterized by high levels of leptin. Notch is upregulated by leptin in breast cancer. Thus, leptin and Notch crosstalk could influence PC progression. Here we investigated in PC cell lines (BxPC-3, MiaPaCa-2, Panc-1, AsPC-1), derived tumorspheres and xenografts whether a functional leptin-Notch axis affects PC progression and expansion of pancreatic cancer stem cells (PCSC). PC cells and tumorspheres were treated with leptin and inhibitors of Notch (gamma-secretase inhibitor, DAPT) and leptin (iron oxide nanoparticle-leptin peptide receptor antagonist 2, IONP-LPrA2). Leptin treatment increased cell cycle progression and proliferation, and the expression of Notch receptors, ligands and targeted molecules (Notch1-4, DLL4, JAG1, Survivin and Hey2), PCSC markers (CD24/CD44/ESA, ALDH, CD133, Oct-4), ABCB1 protein, as well as tumorsphere formation. Leptin-induced effects on PC and tumorspheres were decreased by IONP-LPrA2 and DAPT. PC cells secreted leptin and expressed the leptin receptor, OB-R, which indicates a leptin autocrine/paracrine signaling loop could also affect tumor progression. IONP-LPrA2 treatment delayed the onset of MiaPaCa-2 xenografts, and decreased tumor growth and the expression of proliferation and PCSC markers. Present data suggest that leptin-Notch axis is involved in PC. PC has no targeted therapy and is mainly treated with chemotherapy, whose efficiency could be decreased by leptin and Notch activities. Thus, the leptin-Notch axis could be a novel therapeutic target, particularly for obese PC patients.",

    "abstract": "Although many functions of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) are identified, a role of ATF4 in the hypothalamus in regulating energy homeostasis is unknown. Here, we generated adult-onset agouti-related peptide neuron-specific ATF4 knockout (AgRP-ATF4 KO) mice and found that these mice were lean, with improved insulin and leptin sensitivity and decreased hepatic lipid accumulation. Furthermore, AgRP-ATF4 KO mice showed reduced food intake and increased energy expenditure, mainly because of enhanced thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue. Moreover, AgRP-ATF4 KO mice were resistant to high-fat diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance, and liver steatosis and maintained at a higher body temperature under cold stress. Interestingly, the expression of FOXO1 was directly regulated by ATF4 via binding to the cAMP-responsive element site on its promoter in hypothalamic GT1-7 cells. Finally, Foxo1 expression was reduced in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus of AgRP-ATF4 KO mice, and adenovirus-mediated overexpression of FOXO1 in ARC increased the fat mass in AgRP-ATF4 KO mice. Collectively, our data demonstrate a novel function of ATF4 in AgRP neurons of the hypothalamus in energy balance and lipid metabolism and suggest hypothalamic ATF4 as a potential drug target for treating obesity and its related metabolic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Human bone marrow-derived stromal cells (hBMSC) are multi-potent stem cells that can differentiate into osteogenic and adipogenic lineages. Adiponectin (APN) is an adipocyte-derived hormone that modulates a series of metabolic processes. Recent studies revealed a relationship between APN and bone regeneration, though the underlying mechanism was not fully examined. Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) is a tumor suppressor and a therapeutic target for the metabolic syndrome. Its deletion mutants increase osteoblast activity and bone mineral density. Both APN and PTEN are involved in osteogenic differentiation. However, whether PTEN is involved in APN-induced bone metabolism remains unclear. This project was designed to study whether PTEN was involved in APN-mediated osteogenesis of hBMSCs. We found that APN downregulated PTEN expression and that both it and an inhibitor of PTEN (SF1670) increased the expression of osteogenic markers such as osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase, and runt-related transcription factor-2 in APN-treated hBMSCs. Our results suggested that APN enhanced osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs in&#xa0;vitro partially by inhibiting PTEN expression. APN could be a therapeutic agent in tissue regeneration engineering and bone regeneration by inhibiting PTEN expression and then promoting the osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs.",

    "abstract": "The renin-angiotensin system modulates insulin action. Angiotensin type 1 receptor exerts a deleterious effects while the angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT2R) appears to have beneficial effects providing protection against insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Although recent reports indicate that agonism of AT2R ameliorates diabetes and insulin resistance, the phenotype of AT2R-knockout mice seems to be controversial relating this aspect. Thus, in this study we have explored the role of AT2R in the control of insulin action. To that end, C57Bl/6 mice were administered the synthetic AT2R antagonist PD123319 for 21days (10mg/kg/day ip); vehicle treated animals were used as control. Glucose tolerance, metabolic parameters, in vivo insulin signaling in main insulin-target tissues as well as levels of adiponectin, TNF-&#x3b1;, MCP-1 and IL-6 in adipose tissue were assessed. AT2R blockade with PD123319 induced a marginal effect on glucose homeostasis but an important reduction in the insulin-induced phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and Akt in both liver and adipose tissue. Insulin signaling in skeletal muscle remained unaltered after treatment with PD123319, which could explain the minimal effect on glucose homeostasis induced by PD123319. Our current results reinforce the notion that the AT2R has a physiological role in the conservation of insulin action.",

    "title": "Perivascular adipose tissue as a regulator of vascular disease pathogenesis: identifying novel therapeutic targets.",
    "abstract": "Adipose tissue (AT) is an active endocrine organ with the ability to dynamically secrete a wide range of adipocytokines. Importantly, its secretory profile is altered in various cardiovascular disease states. AT surrounding vessels, or perivascular AT (PVAT), is recognized in particular as an important local regulator of vascular function and dysfunction. Specifically, PVAT has the ability to sense vascular paracrine signals and respond by secreting a variety of vasoactive adipocytokines. Due to the crucial role of PVAT in regulating many aspects of vascular biology, it may constitute a novel therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of vascular disease pathogenesis. Signalling pathways in PVAT, such as those using adiponectin, H2 S, glucagon-like peptide 1 or pro-inflammatory cytokines, are among the potential novel pharmacological therapeutic targets of PVAT.

    "abstract": "Diet composition may affect the onset and progression of chronic degenerative diseases, including cancer, whose pathogenesis relies on inflammatory processes. Growing evidence indicates that diet and its components critically contribute to human health, affecting the immune system, secretion of adipokines, and metabolic pathways. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Antineoplastic drugs are widely used for CRC treatment, but drug resistance and/or off-target toxicity limit their efficacy. Dietary &#x3c9;3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have been gaining great interest in recent years as possible anti-inflammatory and anticancer agents, especially in areas such as the large bowel, where the pro-inflammatory context promotes virtually all steps of colon carcinogenesis. Growing epidemiological, experimental, and clinical evidence suggests that &#x3c9;3 PUFA may play a role in several stages of CRC management exhibiting antineoplastic activity against human CRC cells, improving the efficacy of radiation and chemotherapy, ameliorating cancer-associated secondary complications, and preventing CRC recurrence. These effects are most likely related to the immunomodulatory activities of &#x3c9;3 PUFA that are able to influence several aspects of the inflammatory process ranging from inflammasome activation, leukocyte recruitment, production of immune mediators to differentiation, and activation of immune cells. In this review, we will focus on the potential use of &#x3c9;3 PUFA as adjuvant agents together with chemo/radiotherapy, highlighting the immunomodulatory effects most likely responsible for their beneficial effects in different stages of CRC management.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac adipose tissue-derived stem cells (cASCs) have the ability to differentiate into multiple cell lineages giving them a high potential for use in regenerative medicine. Cardiac fat tissue still raises many unsolved questions related to its formation and features. P2Y nucleotide receptors have already been described as regulators of differentiation of bone-marrow derived stem cells, but remain poorly investigated in cASCs. We defined, in this study, the P2Y4 nucleotide receptor as a negative regulator of cardiac fat formation and cASC adipogenic differentiation. Higher expression of P2Y4 receptor in cardiac fat tissue was observed compared to other adipose tissues. P2Y4-null mice displayed a higher mass of cardiac adipose tissue specifically. We therefore examined the role of P2Y4 receptor in cASC adipogenic differentiation. An inhibitory effect of uridine 5'-triphosphate (UTP), ligand of P2Y4, was observed on the maturation state of differentiated cASCs, and on the expression of adipogenesis-linked genes and adiponectin, a cardioprotective adipokine. Higher adiponectin secretion by P2Y4-null adipocytes could be linked with cardioprotection previously observed in the heart of P2Y4-null ischemic mice. We realized here left anterior descending artery ligation on simple and double-knockout mice for P2Y4 and adiponectin. No cardioprotective effect of P2Y4 loss was observed in the absence of adiponectin secretion. In addition, P2Y4 loss was correlated with higher expression of UCP-1 (uncoupling protein-1) and CD137, two markers of brown/beige cardiac adipocytes. Our data highlight the P2Y4 receptor as an inhibitor of cardiac fat formation and cASC adipogenic differentiation, and as a potential therapeutic target in the regulation of cardioprotective function of cardiac fat.",

    "abstract": "Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) are multipotent progenitor cells that have the capacity to differentiate into specific mesenchymal cell lineages including adipocytes in response to environmental cues. Dysfunctional adipose tissue, rather than an excess of adipose tissue, has been proposed as a key factor in the pathogenesis of obesity-related diseases. The insulin-sensitizing effects of antidiabetic drugs are mediated by activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR&#x3b3;). Here, we investigated the effects of sodium zinc histidine dithiooctanamide (DHL-HisZn), a strong antioxidant, on PPAR&#x3b3; activation, adipocyte differentiation and insulin sensitivity. Additionally, the effects of DHL-HisZn on cellular antioxidant response and inflammatory cytokine production were also evaluated. In ASCs, DHL-HisZn enhanced adipocyte differentiation and PPAR&#x3b3; expression in a dose-dependent manner. DHL-HisZn also increased the relative abundance of insulin-responsive glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and adiponectin mRNA. Furthermore, DHL-HisZn upregulated PPAR&#x3b3; downstream target gene expression. In addition, treatment with DHL-HisZn upregulated mRNA levels of endogenous antioxidants, such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR). DHL-HisZn treatment enhanced insulin signaling and inhibited NF-&#x3ba;B activation, which subsequently suppressed inflammatory cytokine IL-6 expression. Our results indicate that DHL-HisZn enhances insulin sensitivity in adipocytes by increasing the expression of GLUT4 and IRS-1 via the activation of PPAR&#x3b3; and improving the antioxidant response during adipogenic differentiation. Therefore, DHL-HisZn may have the capability to reduce insulin resistance.",

    "abstract": "This study was to investigate whether resistin induces the expression of chemokine ligand 4 (CCL4) during Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) and whether toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) and the nuclear factor-&#x3ba;B (NF-&#x3ba;B) signaling pathway are involved in this process. The expression pattern of resistin and CCL4 in different degenerated human nucleus pulposus (NP) tissues were measured by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR); Effect of resistin on the migration of macrophages was measured by cell migration assay. Resistin-induced CCL4 expression were analyzed by qPCR, Enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) and cell immunofluorescence. Involvement of TLR-4, p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK), and NF-&#x3ba;B signaling pathways were studied by small interfering RNA (siRNA) or Lenti-virus mediated knockdown, co-immunoprecipitation, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Expression of resistin and CCL4 was elevated in degenerated NP&#xa0;tissue. Resistin promoted macrophage migration through CCL4 and its receptor. Expression of CCL4 was significantly increased by resistin treatment. The pharmacological inhibition or siRNA knockdown of TLR-4 blocked the resistin-induced CCL4 expression. Co-immunoprecipitation data confirmed the binding of resistin to TLR4. Pharmacological inhibition of the NF-&#x3ba;B and p38-MAPK signaling pathways attenuated the resistin-induced CCL4 expression. A ChIP&#xa0;assay and lentivirus mediated knockdown showed that resistin regulate CCL4 expression through p65. This study shows that resistin binds to TLR4 and increase the expression of CCL4 through p38-MAPK and NF-&#x3ba;B signaling pathways in NP cells, and this expression causes infiltration of macrophages. This study might provide a feasible therapeutic target for controlling the inflammatory response associated with IVDD.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary metastasis is the major challenge for clinical treatment of osteosarcoma patients. Recent studies indicated that visfatin, a 52kDa adipocytokine, can trigger the cell motility of various cancers, while its role in the progression of osteosarcoma remains not clear. Our present study revealed that visfatin can significantly promote the in vitro migration and invasion of osteosarcoma MG-63 and HOS cells and up regulate the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and fibronectin (FN). Furthermore, visfatin treatment also increased the expression of IL-6 in both MG-63 and HOS cells via a time dependent manner, while anti-IL-6 antibody can significantly attenuate visfatin induced cell invasion and up regulation of MMP-2 and FN. It suggested that up regulation of IL-6 mediated visfatin induced in vitro motility of osteosarcoma cells. Visfatin treatment can increase the phosphorylation of both p65 and ERK1/2 in MG-63 and HOS cells, while only the inhibitor of NF-&#x3ba;B, BAY 11-7082, can abolish visfatin induced up regulation of IL-6. BAY 11-7082 also attenuated visfatin induced upregulation of MMP-2 and FN in MG-63 cells. Western blot analysis revealed that visfatin treatment can significantly increase the phosphorylation of I&#x3ba;B&#x3b1; and IKK&#x3b2; in MG-63 cells. ACHP, the inhibitor of IKK-&#x3b2;, blocked visfatin induced expression of IL-6 mRNA in both MG-63 and HOS cells. Collectively, our data suggested that visfatin can increase the motility of osteosarcoma cells via up regulation of NF-&#x3ba;B/IL-6 signals.

    "title": "Adipose Tissue-Derived Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 Function and Regulation.",
    "abstract": "Adipose tissue has recently been reevaluated as an endocrine organ, and adipose-tissue-derived endocrine factors are termed adipokines. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is the primary inhibitor of PAs, which convert plasminogen into plasmin, a critical protease involved in fibrinolysis. PAI-1 induces fibrinogenesis by suppressing intravascular and tissue fibrinolysis. Moreover, PAI-1 exerts various cellular effects independently of fibrinolysis. Although PAI-1 is expressed in various tissues, its expression is regulated by numerous growth factors, cytokines, and hormones in a paracrine and endocrine manner. Adipocyte-derived PAI-1, predominantly expressed in visceral fat, is released into the circulation in parallel with increased fat mass, and it functions as a crucial adipokine that negatively affects physiological metabolism and vascular biology. Elevated PAI-1 levels induce insulin resistance and metabolic abnormalities during proinflammatory processes involving several cytokines and chemokines in diabetes. Several studies have indicated that PAI-1 plays crucial roles in insulin actions on liver, muscle, and fat. Accumulated fat and enhanced adipose tissue-derived PAI-1 influence metabolism and vessels in relation to macrophage infiltration, chronic inflammation, and free fatty acid release in obese states. PAI-1-induced fibrinolysis abnormalities are associated with metabolic syndrome, leading to cardiovascular disease through dysregulated vascular coagulation, endothelial dysfunction, and metabolic abnormalities. Adipose tissue-derived PAI-1 is involved in insulin resistance, osteoporosis, and sarcopenia induced by glucocorticoid excess in mice. Moreover, PAI-1 is involved in the other pathological states, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and cancer. As such, PAI-1 may be exploited as a marker of disease activity as well being a target for clinical drug development. &#xa9; 2016 American Physiological Society. Compr Physiol 6:1873-1896, 2016.",

    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered to be a hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, and the incidence of NAFLD is increasing rapidly. However, appropriate drugs for treatment of NAFLD are lacking. This study aimed to elucidate the protective effects and mechanisms of Akebia saponin D (ASD) against NAFLD in ob/ob mice and Buffalo rat liver cells. ASD significantly decreased hepatic steatosis and hepatocyte apoptosis in ob/ob mice. ASD also significantly activated autophagic flux, as assessed by the decreased expression of light chain 3 (LC3)-II and P62 accumulation of autophagosomes. In Buffalo rat liver cells, ASD prevented oleic acid (OA)-induced lipid droplets and increased autophagic flux acting as increase the number of autolysosomes than autophagosomes in mTagRFP-mWasabi-LC3. ASD treatment also prevented OA-induced expression of LC3-II, P62, Beclin, and phospho-mammalian target of rapamycin. These effects were similar to those of cotreatment with rapamycin. ASD treatment could not prevent OA-increased, autophagy-related protein expression after treatment with chloroquine or small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of atg7. These results suggest that ASD alleviates hepatic steatosis targeted at the fusion of autophagosomes to lysosomes, and autophagy modulation via ASD may offer a new strategy for treating NAFLD.",

    "title": "The insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) in breast cancer: biology and treatment strategies.",
    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. Although patients are often diagnosed in the early and curable stages, the treatment of metastatic breast cancer remains a major clinical challenge. The combination of chemotherapy with new targeting agents, such as bevacizumab, is helpful in improving patient survival; however, novel treatment strategies are required to improve clinical outcomes. The insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) is a tyrosine kinase cell surface receptor which is involved in the regulation of cell growth and metabolism. Previous studies have shown that activation of the IGF-IR signaling pathway promotes proliferation, survival, and metastasis of breast cancer cells. Additionally, overexpression of IGF-IR is associated with breast cancer cell resistance to anticancer therapies. Recently, IGF-IR has been introduced as a marker of stemness in breast cancer cells and there is also accumulating evidence that IGF-IR contributes to the establishment and maintenance of breast cancer epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Therefore, pharmacological or molecular targeting of IGF-IR could be a promising strategy, in the treatment of patients with breast cancer, particularly in order to circumvent the therapeutic resistance and targeting breast cancer stem/progenitors. Currently, many strategies have been developed for targeting IGF-IR, some have entered clinical trials and some are in preclinical stages for breast cancer therapy. In this review, we will first discuss on the biology of IGF-IR in an attempt to find the role of this receptor in breast cancer and then discuss about therapeutic strategies to target this receptor.",

Treatment with wistin enhanced the marker of adipocyte differentiation, such as triglyceride accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed that wistin increased the expression of PPAR&#x3b3;2 messenger RNA. Moreover, the addition of wistin upregulated the expression of PPAR&#x3b3;-target genes, aP2 and adiponectin in 3T3-L1 cells.

    "abstract": "Vegan protein-based diet has attracted increasing interest in the prevention of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Meanwhile, adiponectin has become a highly potential molecular target in the prevention of MetS. Our study will identify a potential vegan protein diet for the prevention of MetS using rat models. Thirty-six Wistar rats were randomly assigned into three groups and given diets containing one of the following proteins for 12 weeks: casein (CAS, control diet), soy protein (SOY), and gluten-soy mixed protein (GSM). Changes in metabolic parameters as well as the expressions of adiponectin and its receptors were identified. Compared to CAS diet, both SOY and GSM diets led to decreases in blood total cholesterol and triglycerides, but only GSM diet led to an increase in HDL-cholesterol; no marked difference was observed in blood glucose in all three groups; HOMA-IR was found lower only in SOY group. Among groups, the order of serum adiponectin level was found as GSM &gt; SOY &gt; CAS. Similar order pattern was also observed in expression of adiponectin in adipose tissue and AdipoR1 mRNA in skeletal muscle. Our results suggested for the first time that, besides SOY diet, GSM diet could also be a possible substitute of animal protein to prevent MetS.",

    "abstract": "Weight gain has been cited by women as one of the main reasons for discontinuation of the contraceptive depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA). This study aimed to evaluate binge eating and the biochemical markers of appetite in new DMPA users. In this prospective non randomized study with adult healthy women, twenty-eight users of DMPA and twenty-five users of a copper intrauterine device (IUD) were paired for age (&#xb1;1&#xa0;year) and body mass index (BMI) (&#xb1;1&#xa0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>). We evaluated binge eating using the Binge Eating Scale (BES), the serum levels of neuropeptide Y, leptin and adiponectin, and the BMI at baseline and after 12&#xa0;months in both groups. For statistical analysis was used ANOVA for to compare the means of the repeated measurements. Mean age was 29.6 and 28.6&#xa0;years and BMI was 23.9 and 24.5&#xa0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> for the DMPA and IUD groups, respectively. After 12&#xa0;months, the frequency of the scores of binge eating remained low in both groups. There were no significant differences between the groups at 12&#xa0;months with respect to BMI, levels of NPY, leptin, adiponectin, and BES scores. Healthy adult women did not present with central stimulation of appetite or binge eating disorder in their first year after starting use of DMPA. This study reinforces the use of the contraceptive DPMA and the need for guidance related to living a healthy lifestyle for women who attribute the increase of body weight to the use of the method.",

    "title": "Catabolic and proinflammatory effects of leptin in chondrocytes are regulated by suppressor of cytokine signaling-3.",
    "abstract": "Previous studies provide evidence that adipokine leptin increases production of catabolic and proinflammatory factors in chondrocytes and serves as a link between obesity and osteoarthritis (OA). However, the magnitude of the response to leptin treatment varies greatly between chondrocytes from different donor patients. In the present study, we investigated the regulatory role of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3) in the leptin-induced responses in OA cartilage. Cartilage and synovial fluid samples from 97 patients with OA undergoing knee replacement surgery were collected. Cartilage samples were cultured with leptin (10&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/ml), and the levels of proinflammatory and catabolic factors in synovial fluid and in the cartilage culture media, and SOCS-3 expression in the cartilage were measured. The role of SOCS-3 in leptin signaling was further studied in H4 murine chondrocytes by downregulating SOCS-3 with siRNA. Leptin-induced expression of matrix metalloproteinases MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-13, interleukin-6 (IL-6), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were higher in the cartilage samples with low SOCS-3 expression. Accordingly, downregulation of SOCS-3 by siRNA in H4 chondrocytes led to enhanced leptin-induced expression of MMP-3, MMP-13, IL-6 and iNOS. Synovial fluid leptin was associated positively, and cartilage SOCS-3 negatively with synovial fluid levels of MMPs in a multivariate model in obese (body mass index (BMI) &gt;30&#xa0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) but not in non-obese (BMI &lt;30&#xa0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) patients. Our results show, for the first time, that SOCS-3 regulates leptin-induced responses in cartilage, and could thus be a future drug target in the treatment or prevention of OA, especially in obese patients.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to investigate the antiobesity effects of Salvia plebeia R. Br. ethanolic extracts (SPE) in mice fed high-fat diets (HFD). Male C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to four groups: normal diet (Chow), high-fat diet (HFD, 45% fat), HFD+SPE 200 (200&#x2009;mg/kg b.w.), and HFD+SPE 400 (400&#x2009;mg/kg b.w.). Extracts were administered orally every day for 8 weeks. Increases in body/fat weight and feed efficiency ratio were monitored in all mice. In addition, obesity resulting from feeding HFD to the mice was confirmed by the increase of glucose level, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein-c, leptin, and adiponectin in blood. The SPE-treated mice gained less body and mesenteric/subcutaneous adipose tissues weights and had lower TG, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, leptin, and glucose level in serum, compared to the HFD group. Moreover, histopathological examinations revealed that the size of adipocytes in liver and adipose tissue was significantly decreased by SPE, compared to the HFD group. The expression of adipogenesis transcription factors (e.g., peroxisome proliferator activated receptor &#x3b3; and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein &#x3b1;) and lipogenesis-related target genes (adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein 2, lipoprotein lipase, fatty acid synthase, and sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1c) in HFD-induced obese mice was decreased by SPE treatment. These results suggest that SPE attenuates the fat accumulation in HFD-induced obese mice by suppressing the expressions of genes related to adipogenesis and lipogenesis activity. Therefore, SPE could be developed as a potential therapy for reduction of body weight and antiobesity intervention.",

    "abstract": "FGF21 improves the metabolic profile of obese animals through its actions on adipocytes. To elucidate the signaling network responsible for mediating these effects, we quantified dynamic changes in the adipocyte phosphoproteome following acute exposure to FGF21. FGF21 regulated a network of 821 phosphosites on 542 proteins. A major FGF21-regulated signaling node was mTORC1/S6K. In contrast to insulin, FGF21 activated mTORC1 via MAPK rather than through the canonical PI3K/AKT pathway. Activation of mTORC1/S6K by FGF21 was surprising because this is thought to contribute to deleterious metabolic effects such as obesity and insulin resistance. Rather, mTORC1 mediated many of the beneficial actions of FGF21 in&#xa0;vitro, including UCP1 and FGF21 induction, increased adiponectin secretion, and enhanced glucose uptake without any adverse effects on insulin action. This study provides a global view of FGF21 signaling and suggests that mTORC1 may act to facilitate FGF21-mediated health benefits in&#xa0;vivo.",

    "abstract": "As an insulin sensitizer and modulator of inflammatory responses, adiponectin has become a therapeutic target for insulin resistance, diabetes, and diabetes-related complications. Wogonin possesses anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic abilities. However, its effect on generation and secretion of adiponectin is ill-defined in adipocytes. Here, we demonstrated that wogonin administration augmented intracellular adiponectin levels and attenuated adiponectin release in a dose- and time-dependent manner in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes, along with a suppression of PKC&#x3b4; phosphorylation. Wogonin treatment also prevented PKC&#x3b4; overexpression-induced reduction of intracellular adiponectin levels and enhancement of adiponectin release. In addition, wogonin supplementation dramatically increased AMPK phosphorylation and SirT1 expression. Inhibition of either AMPK or SirT1 mitigated wogonin action on adiponectin production and release. Furthermore, inhibition of AMPK by its specific inhibitor markedly reduced wogonin-enhanced mRNA and protein expressions of SirT1. These results suggested that wogonin regulated expression and secretion of adiponectin via PKC&#x3b4;/AMPK/SirT1 signaling pathway in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes.",

    "abstract": "Our aim was to investigate the effect of high levels of glucose, insulin, leptin, and tumor necrosis factor alpha, biomarkers of diabetes in pregnancy, in the process of placentation, using as a cell model a first trimester extravillous human trophoblast cell line (HTR8/SVneo cells). Exposure of HTR8/SVneo cells for 24 hours to either glucose (20 mmol/L) or leptin (25-100 ng/mL) did not cause significant changes in cell proliferation and viability. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (24 hours; 10-100 ng/L) caused a small decrease (10%) in cell proliferation and an increase (9%) in cell viability; however, both effects disappeared when exposure time was increased. Insulin (24 hours; 1-10 nmol/L) caused a concentration- and time-dependent decrease (10%-20%) in cell proliferation; the effect of insulin (10 nmol/L) was more pronounced after a 48 hours exposure (35%). In contrast, exposure to insulin (10 nmol/L; 48 hours) showed no significant effect on cell viability, apoptosis, and migration capacity. Insulin appears to cause hypertrophy of HTR8/SVneo cells as it reduces the cell mitotic index while increasing the culture protein content. The antiproliferative effect of insulin seems to involve activation of mammalian target of rapamycin, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Finally, simvastatin and the polyphenol quercetin potentiated the antiproliferative effect of insulin; on the contrary, the polyphenol resveratrol, the polyunsaturated fatty acids eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids, and folic acid were not able to change it. In conclusion, we show that insulin has an antiproliferative and hypertrophic effect on a first trimester extravillous human trophoblast cell line. So insulin might affect the process of placentation.",

Here, we show that the small GTPase Rap1 is expressed in multiple hypothalamic nuclei that control whole-body metabolism and is activated in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. Genetic ablation of CNS Rap1 protects mice from dietary obesity, glucose imbalance, and insulin resistance in the periphery and from HFD-induced neuropathological changes in the hypothalamus, including diminished cellular leptin sensitivity and increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and inflammation. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of CNS Rap1 signaling normalizes hypothalamic ER stress and inflammation, improves cellular leptin sensitivity, and reduces body weight in mice with dietary obesity. We also demonstrate that Rap1 mediates leptin resistance via interplay with ER stress. Thus, neuronal Rap1 critically regulates leptin sensitivity and mediates HFD-induced obesity and&#xa0;hypothalamic pathology and may represent a potential therapeutic target for obesity treatment.",

    "abstract": "A key pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is amyloid &#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;) accumulation that triggers synaptic impairments and neuronal death. Metabolic disruption is common in AD and recent evidence implicates impaired leptin function in AD. Thus the leptin system may be a novel therapeutic target in AD. Indeed, leptin has cognitive enhancing properties and it prevents the aberrant effects of A&#x3b2; on hippocampal synaptic function and neuronal viability. However, as leptin is a large peptide, development of smaller leptin-mimetics may be the best therapeutic approach. Thus, we have examined the cognitive enhancing and neuroprotective properties of known bioactive leptin fragments. Here we show that the leptin (116-130) fragment, but not leptin (22-56), mirrored the ability of leptin to promote AMPA receptor trafficking to synapses and facilitate activity-dependent hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Administration of leptin (116-130) also mirrored the cognitive enhancing effects of leptin as it enhanced performance in episodic-like memory tests. Moreover, leptin (116-130) prevented hippocampal synaptic disruption and neuronal cell death in models of amyloid toxicity. These findings establish further the importance of the leptin system as a therapeutic target in AD.",

    "abstract": "Leptin increases vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), and Notch expression in cancer cells, and transphosphorylates VEGFR-2 in endothelial cells. However, the mechanisms involved in leptin's actions in endothelial cells are not completely known. Here we investigated whether a leptin-VEGFR-Notch axis is involved in these leptin's actions. To this end, human umbilical vein and porcine aortic endothelial cells (wild type and genetically modified to overexpress VEGFR-1 or -2) were cultured in the absence of VEGF and treated with leptin and inhibitors of Notch (gamma-secretase inhibitors: DAPT and S2188, and silencing RNA), VEGFR (kinase inhibitor: SU5416, and silencing RNA) and leptin receptor, OB-R (pegylated leptin peptide receptor antagonist 2: PEG-LPrA2). Interestingly, in the absence of VEGF, leptin induced the expression of several components of Notch signaling pathway in endothelial cells. Inhibition of VEGFR and Notch signaling significantly decreased leptin-induced S-phase progression, proliferation, and tube formation in endothelial cells. Moreover, leptin/OB-R induced transphosphorylation of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 was essential for leptin's effects. These results unveil for the first time a novel mechanism by which leptin could induce angiogenic features via upregulation/trans-activation of VEGFR and downstream expression/activation of Notch in endothelial cells. Thus, high levels of leptin found in overweight and obese patients might lead to increased angiogenesis by activating VEGFR-Notch signaling crosstalk in endothelial cells. These observations might be highly relevant for obese patients with cancer, where leptin/VEGFR/Notch crosstalk could play an important role in cancer growth, and could be a new target for the control of tumor angiogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a common manifestation of atherosclerosis. A number of emerging risk factors, including oxidative stress biomarkers, free radicals and heat shock proteins, may add to the established risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The present study assessed surrogate markers of oxidative stress, including total reduced glutathione (GSH), lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH), isoprostanes, heme oxygenase&#x2011;1 (HO&#x2011;1) and metabolic biomarkers, such as adiponectin and lactate, in PAD patients (n=27). Healthy age&#x2011;matched volunteers (n=27) served as controls. GSH and LOOH were evaluated by measuring total thiol groups and iron oxidation, respectively, by spectrophotometric analysis. Adiponectin, isoprostanes and HO&#x2011;1 levels were determined using commercially available ELISA kits and lactate level was determined colorimetrically. Results from patients with PAD demonstrated no significant difference in GSH content and LOOH formation when compared with healthy controls (5.1&#xb1;7.6&#xa0;vs.&#xa0;6.9&#xb1;9.1&#xa0;nmol/ml and 6.8&#xb1;14.2&#xa0;vs.&#xa0;8.3&#xb1;14.9&#xa0;nmol/ml, respectively), however, isoprostanes were demonstrated to be significantly reduced (3.8&#xb1;4.8&#xa0;pg/ml&#xa0;vs.&#xa0;120&#xb1;91&#xa0;pg/mll; P&lt;0.001). Furthermore, HO&#x2011;1, a protective heat shock protein, was significantly reduced in PAD patients (0.8&#xb1;0.7&#xa0;vs.&#xa0;3.4&#xb1;1.3&#xa0;ng/ml; P&lt;0.001). Adiponectin, an antiatherogenic adipokine, was not significantly different between the two groups (1.4&#xb1;0.2&#xa0;vs.&#xa0;1.5&#xb1;0.5&#xa0;&#xb5;g/ml), whereas serum lactate was significantly higher in PAD patients compared with controls (0.11&#xb1;0.01&#xa0;vs.&#xa0;0.1&#xb1;0.01&#xa0;mM; P&lt;0.05). Using multivariate analysis, HO&#x2011;1, hypertension, smoking and dyslipidemia were indicated to be independently associated with the presence of PAD, while only ankle&#x2011;brachial index was an independent predictor of severity of PAD. The oxidative pathway may be partially involved in the onset and progression of PAD and may represent a target to reduce the risk of ischemic events.",

    "abstract": "Resistin levels have been reported to be abnormal in obesity-related cancer patients with epidemiological studies yielding inconsistent results. Therefore, a meta-analysis was performed to assess the association between blood resistin levels and obesity-related cancer risk. A total of 13 studies were included for pooling ORs analysis. High resistin levels were found in cancer patients (OR= 1.20, 95% CI= 1.10-1.30). After excluding one study primarily contributing to between-study heterogeneity, the association between resistin levels and cancer risk was still significant (OR=1.18, 95% CI = 1.09-1.28). Stratification analysis found resistin levels were not associated with cancer risk in prospective studies. Meta-regression analysis identified factors such as geographic area, detection assay, or study design as confounders to between-study variance. The result of 18 studies of pooling measures on SMD analysis was that high resistin levels were associated with increased cancer risk (SMD = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.63-1.25), but not in the pooling SMD analysis of prospective studies. Except for the studies identified as major contributors to heterogeneity by Galbraith plot, resistin levels were still higher in cancer patients (SMD = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.63-0.87) in retrospective studies. Meta-regression analysis found factors, such as geographic area, BMI-match, size, and quality score, could account for 66.7% between-study variance in pooling SMD analysis of retrospective studies. Publication bias was not found in pooling ORs analysis. Our findings indicated high resistin levels were associated with increased obesity-related cancer risk. However, it may not be a predictor.",

    "abstract": "Thiazolidinediones (TZDs; pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) have provided promising results in clinical trials for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The main purpose of this systematic review was to summarize evidence on circulating adiponectin levels in relation to histological changes following TZD treatment in patients with histologically confirmed NASH. We performed a systematic search in PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane Library. We included four studies, published between 2006 and 2012, providing data for 187 histologically confirmed NASH adult patients (105 on TZD and 82 controls) treated for 6-12months. Significant increase in adiponectin (80-178%) after TZD treatment was observed in all included studies. Improvement in steatosis following treatment was observed in all studies. A trend towards improvement in lobular inflammation was observed in all studies after pioglitazone, but not after rosiglitazone. Trends toward improvement in ballooning and fibrosis were observed in the two studies after pioglitazone using either the highest doses or the longest duration of therapy. Overall disease activity score was improved in all studies after pioglitazone, but not after rosiglitazone. Insulin resistance and liver function tests were also improved after treatment. Despite weight gain, circulating leptin was not increased after treatment. In conclusion, parallel increases in circulating adiponectin levels and histological improvement were observed in this systematic review. These results warrant further consideration of TZDs, but even more importantly point to a key role for novel potential treatments for NASH patients such as the newer selective peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-&#x3b3; modulators, which increase adiponectin without significant weight gain.",

    "abstract": "Thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1) is abundantly expressed in visceral adipose tissue and this expression is up-regulated in obese humans and rodents. Recent studies showed that genetic deletion of TSP-1 protects mice from diet-induced insulin resistance. However, the molecular mechanism is largely unknown. In this study, we examined the effect of recombinant TSP-1 on insulin signaling in cultured cells from insulin sensitive tissues to investigate whether TSP-1 could act as an adipokine. Here we show that treatment with recombinant TSP-1 suppressed insulin signaling in cultured muscle cells, which was accompanied by the activation of stress signaling such as JNK, p38, and IKK. These results suggest that TSP-1 acts as an adipokine which is involved in the pathogenesis of obesity-induced insulin resistance. Thus, TSP-1 could be a potential target for the treatment of insulin resistance and metabolic disease related to insulin resistance.",

    "abstract": "Endometrial carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies of the female reproductive system, but the aetiology and pathogenesis are not well understood, although adipokines such as visfatin may be involved. Our study provides insight into the mechanism underlying the tumorigenic effects of visfatin in endometrial carcinoma. We investigated the effect of visfatin on endometrial carcinoma cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis using well-differentiated Ishikawa cells and poorly differentiated KLE cells. We also assessed the effect of visfatin on tumour growth in vivo. Visfatin stimulated the proliferation of both Ishikawa and KLE cells, and visfatin treatment promoted G1/S phase progression and inhibited endometrial carcinoma cell apoptosis. Visfatin promoted endometrial carcinoma tumour growth in BALB/c-nu mice. Transplanted tumour tissues from an endometrial carcinoma mouse model were analysed using immunohistochemical staining, which revealed much stronger positive signals for Ki-67 with over-abundant visfatin. Western blot analysis revealed that insulin receptor (IR), insulin receptor substrate (IRS)1/2 and key components of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 signalling pathways were highly expressed in endometrial carcinoma cells exposed to visfatin. Treated cells showed increased C-MYC and cyclin D1 and reduced caspase-3 expression. The effects of visfatin on proliferation and apoptosis were abrogated by treatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and MEK inhibitor U0126. Visfatin promotes the malignant progression of endometrial carcinoma via activation of IR and PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK signalling. Visfatin may serve as a therapeutic target in the treatment of endometrial carcinoma.",

    "abstract": "We have previously reported that administration of low molecular weight chitosan oligosaccharide (GO2KA1) significantly suppressed postprandial blood glucose rise with increased plasma adiponectin and HbA1c levels in animals and humans. However, the cellular mechanisms whereby GO2KA1 exerts antihyperglycemic effects still remain to be determined. Using intestinal Caco-2 cells and 3T3-L1 cells, here we show that GO2KA1 has dual modes of antidiabetic action by (1) inhibiting intestinal &#x3b1;-glucosidase as well as glucose transporters SGLT1 and GLUT2 that were distinct from the acarbose effect; (2) enhancing adipocyte differentiation, PPAR&#x3b3; expression and its target genes, such as FABP4, adiponectin, and GLUT4, whereas the effects were abolished by co-treatment with BADGE, a PPAR&#x3b3; antagonist. Moreover, GO2KA1 significantly increased glucose uptake, which was reduced in the presence of BADGE. Our data show that GO2KA1 may prevent hyperglycemia by inhibiting intestinal glucose digestion and transport and also enhance glucose uptake, at least in part, by upregulating adiponectin expression through PPAR&#x3b3; in adipocytes. These findings may provide potential molecular modes of action for the antidiabetic effects of chitosan oligosaccharide observed in clinical and animal studies. &#xa9; 2016 BioFactors, 43(1):90-99, 2017.",

    "abstract": "Visceral obesity induces the onset of metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus. Adipose tissue is considered as a potential pharmacological target for treating metabolic disorders. The fruit of Terminalia bellirica is extensively used in Ayurvedic medicine to treat patients with diseases such as diabetes mellitus. We previously investigated the effects of a hot water extract of T. bellirica fruit (TB) on obesity and insulin resistance in spontaneously obese type 2 diabetic mice. To determine the active ingredients of TB and their molecular mechanisms, we focused on adipocyte differentiation using mouse 3T3-L1 cells, which are widely used to study adipocyte physiology. We show here that TB enhanced the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells to mature adipocytes and that one of the active main components was identified as gallic acid. Gallic acid (10-30&#x2009;&#xb5;M) enhanced the expression and secretion of adiponectin via adipocyte differentiation and also that of fatty acid binding protein-4, which is the target of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR&#x3b3;), although it does not alter the expression of the upstream genes PPAR&#x3b3; and CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha. In the PPAR&#x3b3; ligand assay, the binding of gallic acid to PPAR&#x3b3; was undetectable. These findings indicate that gallic acid mediates the therapeutic effects of TB on metabolic disorders by regulating adipocyte differentiation. Therefore, TB shows promise as a candidate for preventing and treating patients with metabolic syndrome.",

The aim of this study was to clarify the effects of PGRN on reactivity of isolated blood vessel. Isometric contraction of rat isolated superior mesenteric artery was measured. Pre-treatment with PGRN (10-100&#xa0;ng&#xa0;mL<sup>-1</sup> , 30&#xa0;min) had no effect on noradrenaline- or 5-hydroxytriptamine-induced contraction. On the other hand, pre-treatment with PGRN (100&#xa0;ng&#xa0;mL<sup>-1</sup> ) augmented acetylcholine (ACh; 30&#xa0;nm)-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation. Pre-treatment with PGRN (100&#xa0;ng&#xa0;mL<sup>-1</sup> ) augmented ACh (10&#xa0;&#x3bc;m)-induced nitric oxide (NO)-mediated relaxation in the presence of indomethacin (10&#xa0;&#x3bc;m), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, and tetraethyl ammonium (10&#xa0;mm), a non-selective potassium channel blocker. In contrast, pre-treatment with PGRN (100&#xa0;ng&#xa0;mL<sup>-1</sup> ) had no effect on ACh-induced endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor-mediated relaxation. Pre-treatment with PGRN (100&#xa0;ng&#xa0;mL<sup>-1</sup> ) had no effect on ACh (10&#xa0;&#x3bc;m, 1&#xa0;min)-induced endothelial NO synthase phosphorylation (at Ser1177) as determined by Western blotting.

In the presence of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (100&#xa0;&#x3bc;m), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, pre-treatment with PGRN (100&#xa0;ng&#xa0;mL<sup>-1</sup> ) increased SNP (30&#xa0;nm, 5&#xa0;min)-induced cGMP production as determined by enzyme immunoassay. We for the first time demonstrate that PGRN augments ACh-induced NO-mediated relaxation through the increases of cGMP production in smooth muscle. These results indicate PGRN as a possible pharmacotherapeutic target against cardiovascular diseases including obesity-related hypertension.",

    "abstract": "Zfp637 is a recently identified zinc finger protein, and its functions remain largely unknown. Here, we innovatively demonstrate the effects of Zfp637 on the differentiation of mouse spermatogonia and on its downstream target gene SOX2 in vitro. Obesity has been recognized as a chronic inflammatory disease that leads to decreased sexual function and sexual development disorders. We observed higher levels of IL-6 in serum and testis homogenates from obese mice compared with control mice. We also demonstrated that high levels of IL-6 inhibited Zfp637 expression, and we elucidated the underlying mechanisms. SOCS3 overexpression and STAT3 phosphorylation inhibitor (AG490) were used to investigate the function of the SOCS3/STAT3 pathway during this process. Our results showed that exposure of mouse spermatogonial cells to high levels of IL-6 inhibited Zfp637 expression by increasing SOCS3 expression and inhibiting the phosphorylation of STAT3, further reducing cellular differentiation. Consistent with the in vitro results, we observed increasing expression levels of SOCS3 and SOX2, but a reduction of Zfp637 expression, in obese mouse testes. In conclusion, Zfp637 plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis by downregulating SOX2 expression, and IL-6 can decrease the expression of Zfp637 through the SOCS3/STAT3 signaling pathway.",

Overexpression of ZAG significantly inhibited lipogenesis, promoted lipolysis and fatty acid &#x3b2;-oxidation, and attenuated PA-induced intracellular fat accumulation. Moreover, ZAG overexpression dramatically stimulated adiponectin expression in HepG2 cells. In contrast, knockdown of ZAG notably inhibited fatty acid &#x3b2;-oxidation, increased lipogenesis and lipid accumulation. Collectively, these data suggest that ZAG has the potential to alleviate hepatosteatosis, making it a promising therapeutic target for fatty liver.",

    "title": "[Effects of berberine on mRNA expression levels of PPAR&#x3b3; and adipocytokines in insulin-resistant adipocytes].",
    "abstract": "Adipocytokines are closely associated with insulin resistance (IR) in adipose tissues, and they are more and more seriously taken in the study of the development of diabetes. This experiment was mainly to study the effect of berberine on mRNA expression levels of PPAR&#x3b3; and adipocytokines in insulin resistant adipocytes, and investigate the molecular mechanism of berberine in enhancing insulin sensitization and application advantages of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). ddPCR absolute quantification analysis was taken in this experiment to simply and intuitively determine the appropriate reference genes. ddPCR and quantitative Real-time PCR (qPCR) were used to compare the effect of different doses of berberine (10, 20, 50, 100 &#x3bc;mol&#x2022;L&#x207b;&#xb9;) on mRNA expression levels of PPAR&#x3b3;, adiponectin, resistin and leptin in IR 3T3-L1adipocytes. Antagonist GW9662 was added to study the inherent correlation between PPAR&#x3b3; and adiponectin mRNA expression levels. ddPCR results showed that the expression level of &#x3b2;-actin in adipocytes was stable, and suitable as reference gene for normalization of quantitative PCR data. Both of ddPCR and qPCR results showed that, as compared with IR models, the mRNA expression levels of adiponectin were decreased in the treatment with berberine (10, 20, 50, 100 &#x3bc;mol&#x2022;L&#x207b;&#xb9;) in a dose-dependent manner (P&lt;0.01); the expression of PPAR&#x3b3; was decreased by 20, 50, 100 &#x3bc;mol&#x2022;L&#x207b;&#xb9; berberine in a dose-dependent manner in qPCR assay (P&lt;0.01) and decreased only by 50 and 100 &#x3bc;mol&#x2022;L&#x207b;&#xb9; berberine in ddPCR assay (P&lt;0.05). PPAR&#x3b3; specific antagonist GW9662 intervention experiment showed that adiponectin gene expression was directly relevant with PPAR&#x3b3; (P&lt;0.05). ddPCR probe assay showed that various doses of berberine could significantly reduce mRNA expression levels of resistin and leptin (P&lt;0.01) in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, berberine enhanced insulin sensitization effect not by up-regulating adiponect in expression of transcriptional level in PPAR&#x3b3;-dependent manner, but may by the elevated multimerization of adiponectin in the posttranslational regulation level. Berberine down-regulated the resistin and leptin expression levels, which could alleviate lipolysis and improve IR in adipocytes. ddPCR provided better sensitivity and linear range than qPCR, with obvious technical advantages for the detection of low abundance expression of target genes.",

    "title": "Leptin inhibitors from fungal endophytes (LIFEs): Will be novel therapeutic drugs for obesity and its associated immune mediated diseases.",
    "abstract": "Treatment of obesity and its associated immune mediated diseases is challenging due to impaired function of leptin system. Thus leptin is providing an interesting target for therapeutic intervention. Leptin, an adipose tissue-derived adipokine, displays a variety of immune functions, and regulate both innate and adaptive immune responses. The increased secretion of leptin (hyperleptinemia) and production of proinflammatory cytokines has been implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity-related immune diseases such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atherosclerosis, cancer, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, crohn's disease and multiple sclerosis. These disorders are managed through antibiotics and by cytokines replacement. However, the effectiveness of cytokines coupled to the complexity of the cytokine network leads to severe side-effects, which can still occur after careful preclinical evaluation. In addition, synthetic immunotherapeutics carries a degree of risk, is time-consuming and expensive. Hence, the complexity of existing therapy and adverse effects emphasizes the need of an alternative approach for the management of immune dysfunction associated with obesity and its related diseases. For the aforementioned diseases that are related to leptin overabundance, new drugs blocking leptin signaling need to be generated. The research on the discovery of clinically important novel compounds from natural source is expanding due to their safety and no side effect. The fungal endophytes are the microbes that colonize internal tissue of plants without causing negative effects to the host. They produce plethora of substances of potential use to modern medicinal and pharmaceutical industry. The increasing body of evidence associated with application of bioactive metabolites derived from fungal endophytes in diverse disease states merits its use as therapeutic drugs. In particular, the saponins have been extensively proved to modulate the immune system, which has raised a significant interest in their potential as immunomodulators. Thus, our hypothesis is that the saponins derived from fungal endophytes can be explored as clinical applicable leptin inhibitors for treating immune mediated diseases.",

    "abstract": "Vaspin (visceral adipose tissue-derived serine protease inhibitor) is a newly discovered adipokine that widely participates in diabetes mellitus, polycystic ovarian syndrome and other disorders of metabolism. However, the effect of vaspin on the regulation of osteogenesis and the mechanism responsible are still unclear. Here, we found that vaspin can attenuate the osteogenic differentiation of the preosteoblast cell line MC3T3-E1 in a dose-dependent way; also, during this process, the expression of miRNA-34c (miR-34c) was significantly increased. Down-regulation of the expression of miR-34c in MC3T3-E1 diminished the osteogenic inhibitory effect of vaspin, while the up-regulation of miR-34c increased this effect through its target gene Runx2. Meanwhile, we found that vaspin could also activate the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway. Blocking the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway with specific inhibitors could decrease the osteogenic inhibitory effect of vaspin as well as the expression level of miR-34c. Furthermore, knock-down of miR-34c could promote the activation of Akt, which was probably realised by targeting c-met expression. Thus, PI3K-Akt and miR-34c constituted a modulation loop and controlled the expression of each other. Taken together, our study showed that vaspin could inhibit the osteogenic differentiation in vitro, and the PI3K-Akt/miR-34c loop might be the underlying mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Adipose tissue PKA has roles in adipogenesis, lipolysis, and mitochondrial function. PKA transduces the cAMP signal downstream of G protein-coupled receptors, which are being explored for therapeutic manipulation to reduce obesity and improve metabolic health. This study aimed to determine the overall physiological consequences of PKA activation in adipose tissue. Mice expressing an activated PKA catalytic subunit in adipose tissue (Adipoq-caPKA mice) showed increased PKA activity in subcutaneous, epididymal, and mesenteric white adipose tissue (WAT) depots and brown adipose tissue (BAT) compared with controls. Adipoq-caPKA mice weaned onto a high-fat diet (HFD) or switched to the HFD at 26 wk of age were protected from diet-induced weight gain. Metabolic health was improved, with enhanced insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, and &#x3b2;-cell function. Adipose tissue health was improved, with smaller adipocyte size and reduced macrophage engulfment of adipocytes. Using metabolic cages, we found that Adipoq-caPKA mice were shown to have increased energy expenditure, but no difference to littermate controls in physical activity or food consumption. Immunoblotting of adipose tissue showed increased expression of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) in BAT and dramatic UCP1 induction in subcutaneous WAT, but no induction in the visceral depots. Feeding a HFD increased PKA activity in epididymal WAT of wild-type mice compared with chow, but did not change PKA activity in subcutaneous WAT or BAT. This was associated with changes in PKA regulatory subunit expression. This study shows that adipose tissue PKA activity is sufficient to increase energy expenditure and indicates that PKA is a beneficial target in metabolic health.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian receptors are recognized as target molecules for drug discovery, and chemical libraries have been screened for both potential antagonists and agonists mainly by ligand-binding assays using immobilized receptors. A bio-nanocapsule (BNC) of approximately 30 nm that displays a tandem form of the protein A-derived immunoglobulin G (IgG) Fc-binding Z domains (denoted as ZZ-BNC) has been developed for both clustering and oriented immobilization of IgGs on the solid phase of immunosensors. In this study, human IgG1 Fc-fused vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor was immobilized through ZZ-BNC on the sensor chip of quartz crystal microbalance (ZZ-BNC-coating). When compared with direct adsorption and protein A-coating, the sensor chip showed higher sensitivity (&#x223d;46- and &#x223d;165-fold, respectively) and larger ligand-binding capacity (&#x223d;4- and &#x223d;18-fold, respectively). Furthermore, the number of VEGF molecules bound to its receptor increased from 0.20 (direct adsorption) to 2.06 by ZZ-BNC-coating, strongly suggesting that ZZ-BNC reduced the steric hindrance near ligand recognition sites through oriented immobilization. Similarly, the sensitivity and ligand-binding capacity of leptin and prolactin receptors were both enhanced at a level comparable to that observed for the VEGF receptor. Thus, the combination of ZZ-BNC and Fc-fused receptors could significantly improve the function of ligand-binding assays.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidences suggested visfatin, a newly discovered obesity-induced adipocytokine, is involved in promotion of cancer malignancy and correlated with worse clinical prognosis. While its effects and mechanisms on progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unclear. Our clinical data show that visfatin protein is over expressed, positive associated with lymph node metastasis, high-grade tumor, and poor prognosis in 87 CRC patients. The levels of plasma visfatin are significantly upregulated in Stage IV colon cancer. Visfatin can significantly promote the in vitro migration and invasion of CRC cells via induction epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). It can increase the expression and nuclear translocation of Snail, a key transcription factor in regulating EMT. While silencing of Snail attenuates visfatin induced EMT. Further studies reveal visfatin can inhibit the association of Snail with GSK-3&#x3b2; and subsequently suppress ubiquitylation of Snail. In addition, visfatin can increase the expression and nuclear translocation of &#x3b2;-catenin, elevate its binding with Snail promoter, and then increase the transcription of Snail. While inhibitor of PI3K/Akt, LY294002, abolishes visfatin induced up regulation of Snail, Vimentin (Vim), &#x3b2;-catenin, and phosphorylated GSK-3&#x3b2;. In summary, our data suggest that increased expression of visfatin are associated with a more aggressive phenotype of CRC patients.

    "abstract": "Hepatic steatosis is characterised by excessive triglyceride accumulation in the form of lipid droplets (LD); however, mechanisms differ in drug induced (DIS) and/or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Here we hypothesized distinct molecular circuits of microRNA/LD-associated target genes and searched for mechanistically linked serum and tissue biomarkers that would distinguish between DIS and human NAFLD of different grades. We analysed &gt;800 rat hepatic whole genome data for 17 steatotic drugs and identified 157 distinct miRNAs targeting 77 DIS regulated genes. Subsequently, genomic data of N&#x2009;=&#x2009;105 cases of human NAFLD and N&#x2009;=&#x2009;32 healthy controls were compared to serum miRNA profiles of N&#x2009;=&#x2009;167 NAFLD patients.

The NASH serum regulated miRNAs informed on hepatic inflammation, adipocytokine and insulin signalling, ER-and caveolae associated activities and altered glycerolipid metabolism. Conversely, serum miRNAs associated with blunt steatosis specifically highlighted activity of FOXO1&amp;HNF4&#x3b1; on CPT2, the lipid droplet and ER-lipid-raft associated PLIN3 and Erlin1. Altogether, serum miRNAs informed on the molecular pathophysiology of NAFLD and permitted differentiation between DIS and NAFLD of different grades.",

    "title": "Inhibition of Leptin-ObR Interaction Does not Prevent Leptin Translocation Across a Human Blood-Brain Barrier Model.",
    "abstract": "The adipocyte-derived hormone leptin regulates appetite and energy homeostasis through the activation of leptin receptors (ObR) on hypothalamic neurones; hence, leptin must be transported through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to reach its target sites in the central nervous system. During obesity, however, leptin BBB transport is decreased, in part precluding leptin as a viable clinical therapy against obesity. Although the short isoform of the ObR (ObRa) has been implicated in the transport of leptin across the BBB as a result of its elevated expression in cerebral microvessels, accumulating evidence indicates that leptin BBB transport is independent of ObRa. In the present study, we employed an ObR-neutralising antibody (9F8) to directly examine the involvement of endothelial ObR in leptin transport across an in&#xa0;vitro human BBB model composed of the human endothelial cell line hCMEC/D3. Our results indicate that, although leptin transport across the endothelial monolayer was nonparacellular, and energy- and endocytosis-dependent, it was not inhibited by pre-treatment with 9F8, despite the ability of the latter to recognise hCMEC/D3-expressed ObR, prevent leptin-ObR binding and inhibit leptin-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT-3) phosphorylation in hCMEC/D3 cells. Furthermore, hCMEC/D3 cells expressed the transporter protein low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-2 (LRP-2), which is capable of binding and endocytosing leptin. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that leptin binding to and signalling through ObR is not required for efficient transport across human endothelial monolayers, indicating that ObR is not the primary leptin transporter at the human BBB, a role which may fall upon LRP-2. A deeper understanding of leptin BBB transport will help clarify the exact causes for leptin resistance seen in obesity and aid in the development of more efficient BBB-penetrating leptin analogues.",

    "title": "Leptin-mediated ion channel regulation: PI3K pathways, physiological role, and therapeutic potential.",
    "abstract": "Leptin is produced by adipose tissue and identified as a satiety signal, informing the brain when the body has consumed enough food. Specific areas of the hypothalamus express leptin receptors (LEPRs) and are the primary site of leptin action for body weight regulation. In response to leptin, appetite is suppressed and energy expenditure allowed. Beside this hypothalamic action, leptin targets other brain areas in addition to neuroendocrine cells. LEPRs are expressed also in the hippocampus, neocortex, cerebellum, substantia nigra, pancreatic &#x3b2;-cells, and chromaffin cells of the adrenal gland. It is intriguing how leptin is able to activate different ionic conductances, thus affecting excitability, synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter release, depending on the target cell. Most of the intracellular pathways activated by leptin and directed to ion channels involve PI3K, which in turn phosphorylates different downstream substrates, although parallel pathways involve AMPK and MAPK. In this review we will describe the effects of leptin on BK, KATP, KV, CaV, TRPC, NMDAR and AMPAR channels and clarify the landscape of pathways involved. Given the ability of leptin to influence neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity by modulating ion channels activity, we also provide a short overview of the growing potentiality of leptin as therapeutic agent for treating neurological disorders.",

    "abstract": "Migraine is comorbid with obesity. Recent research suggests an association between migraine and adipocytokines, proteins that are predominantly secreted from adipose tissue and which participate in energy homeostasis and inflammatory processes. In this review, we first briefly discuss the association between migraine and obesity and the importance of adipose tissue as a neuroendocrine organ. We then present a systematic review of the extant literature evaluating circulating levels of adiponectin and leptin in those with migraine. A search of the PubMed database was conducted using the keywords migraine, adiponectin, and leptin. In addition reference lists of relevant articles were reviewed for possible inclusion. English language studies published between 2005 and 2015 evaluating circulating blood concentration of adiponectin or leptin in those with migraine were included. While the existing data are suggestive that adipokines may be associated with migraine, substantial study design differences and conflicting results limit definitive conclusions. Future research utilizing carefully considered designs and methodology is warranted. In particular careful and systematic characterization of pain states at the time of samples, as well as systematic consideration of demographic (e.g., age, sex) and other vital covariates (e.g., obesity status, lipids) are needed to determine if adipokines play a role in migraine pathophysiology and if any adipokine represents a viable, novel migraine biomarker, or drug target.",

    "abstract": "Leptin, a cytokine produced by the adipose tissue in response to food intake, is a key player in the regulation of energy balance and body weight control. Physiological action of leptin in modulating the metabolic adaptation of different peripheral tissues supports the hypothesis that it could also exert a direct effect on cancer cells. In vitro, treatment with leptin up-regulated HIF-1&#x3b1; and stimulated adhesion and invasion of prostate cancer cells cultured in hypoxia. Leptin action was effective in both low and high glycolytic cancer cell lines, and determined the up-regulation of lactate exporter MCT4 and its associated protein CD147. HIF-1&#x3b1; stabilization was oligomycin-independent and was associated with an important modulation of mitochondrial homeostasis. In fact, leptin treatment produced mitochondrial biogenesis, stabilization of mitochondrial membrane potential and increased uncoupled respiration through the up-regulation of UCP2. Furthermore, leptin counteracted the downmodulation of SIRT1 induced by hypoxia, and persistent high levels of SIRT1 were directly involved in HIF-1&#x3b1; stabilization. Leptin can sustain cancer progression in hypoxic environment and when mitochondrial respiration is impaired. Leptin signaling axis, including the new proposed intermediate SIRT1, could represent a new diagnostic and therapeutic target in prostate cancer.",

    "abstract": "The cJun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)-signaling pathway is implicated in metabolic syndrome, including dysregulated blood glucose concentration and insulin resistance. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a target of the hepatic JNK-signaling pathway and may contribute to the regulation of glycemia. To test the role of FGF21, we established mice with selective ablation of the Fgf21 gene in hepatocytes. FGF21 deficiency in the liver caused marked loss of FGF21 protein circulating in the blood. Moreover, the protective effects of hepatic JNK deficiency to suppress metabolic syndrome in high-fat diet-fed mice were not observed in mice with hepatocyte-specific FGF21 deficiency, including reduced blood glucose concentration and reduced intolerance to glucose and insulin. Furthermore, we show that JNK contributes to the regulation of hepatic FGF21 expression during fasting/feeding cycles. These data demonstrate that the hepatokine FGF21 is a key mediator of JNK-regulated metabolic syndrome.",

    "title": "Parkinsonia aculeata (Caesalpineaceae) improves high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance in mice through the enhancement of insulin signaling and mitochondrial biogenesis.",
    "abstract": "The search for natural agents that minimize obesity-associated disorders is receiving special attention. Parkinsonia aculeata L. (Caesalpineaceae) has long been used in Brazil as a hypoglycaemic herbal medicine, without any scientific basis. In this context, we aimed to use molecular and physiological methods to study the effect of a hydroethanolic extract partitioned with ethyl acetate from the aerial parts of Parkinsonia aculeata (HEPa/EtOAc) on insulin resistance in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity (DIO). Firstly, C57BL/6J mice were fed either with standard rodent chow diet or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 consecutive weeks. Then, the animals were treated with HEPa/EtOAc at two doses (125 and 250mg/kg/day) or metformin (200mg/kg/day) for 16 days. At the end of the experiment, body weight, fat pad weight, fasting serum glucose (FSG), insulin (FSI) and leptin were measured. Homeostasis Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) was also calculated. Glucose, insulin and pyruvate tolerance tests were performed. The expression and phosphorylation of IR&#x3b2;(tyr), Akt(ser473), AMPK&#x3b1; and PGC1&#x3b1; in liver, muscle and adipose tissue were determined by Western blot analyses. Herein we demonstrate for the first time an improvement in insulin resistance following HEPa/EtOAc administration in obese mice, as shown by increased glucose, insulin and pyruvate tolerance, as well as an improvement in FSG, FSI, HOMA-IR and circulating leptin levels, which together are in part due to enhancement of the insulin signaling pathway in its main target tissues. Surprisingly, the increase in activation of the AMPK&#x3b1;-PGC1-&#x3b1; axis by HEPa/EtOAc was similar to that produced by metformin treatment in the liver and muscle tissues. In conclusion, P. aculeata appears to be a source of therapeutic agent against obesity-related complications.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth cause of cancer death with an overall survival of 5% at five years. The development of PDAC is characteristically associated to the accumulation of distinctive genetic mutations and is preceded by the exposure to several risk factors. Epidemiology has demonstrated that PDAC risk factors may be non-modifiable risks (sex, age, presence of genetic mutations, ethnicity) and modifiable and co-morbidity factors related to the specific habits and lifestyle. Recently it has become evident that obesity and diabetes are two important modifiable risk factors for PDAC. Obesity and diabetes are complex systemic and intertwined diseases and, over the years, experimental evidence indicate that insulin-resistance, alteration of adipokines, especially leptin and adiponectin, oxidative stress and inflammation may play a role in PDAC. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-&#x3b3; (PPAR&#x3b3;) is a nuclear receptor transcription factor that is implicated in the regulation of metabolism, differentiation and inflammation. PPAR&#x3b3; is a key regulator of adipocytes differentiation, regulates insulin and adipokines production and secretion, may modulate inflammation, and it is implicated in PDAC. PPAR&#x3b3; agonists are used in the treatment of diabetes and oxidative stress-associated diseases and have been evaluated for the treatment of PDAC. PPAR&#x3b3; is at the cross-road of diabetes, obesity, and PDAC and it is an interesting target to pharmacologically prevent PDAC in obese and diabetic patients.",

    "title": "Leptin induces the apoptosis of chondrocytes in an in vitro model of osteoarthritis via the JAK2&#x2011;STAT3 signaling pathway.",
    "abstract": "Emerging data has suggested a high prevalence of osteoarthritis (OA) among obese people. As an important adipokine secreted by white adipose tissue, leptin may be a key mediator in the progression of OA. Leptin exerts a catabolic effect on OA cartilage by increasing the production of metalloproteinase (MMP) enzymes, and contributes to apoptosis in chondrocytes. The current study aimed to explore the role of leptin on the apoptosis of chondrocytes in OA, and its underlying mechanisms. In the in vitro model of OA used in the present study, administration of exogenous leptin induced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis in chondrocytes. It has been demonstrated that leptin is associated with the pathogenesis of OA via the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)&#x2011;signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway, and data gathered in the present study demonstrated that suppression of this signaling pathway using a JAK2 inhibitor, AG490, significantly ameliorated leptin&#x2011;induced apoptosis in damaged chondrocytes in vitro, and reduced the generation of ROS. Furthermore, the protein expression levels of MMP&#x2011;13 and B&#x2011;cell lymphoma 2&#x2011;associated X protein were downregulated in the AG490&#x2011;treated group. The results of the present study may provide insight into the underlying molecular mechanism by which leptin induces apoptosis in chondrocytes. These findings indicated the importance of leptin as a therapeutic target for the treatment of OA in the overweight population.",

    "abstract": "Adipocytokines apelin peptide, the ligand of APJ (putative receptor related to the angiotensin receptor AT1), plays key roles in the pathogenesis and deterioration of cancer. In lung cancer, apelin elevating microvessel densities has been reported. Our previous research has characterized that apelin-13 promoted lung adenocarcinoma cell proliferation. However, the effect of apelin on metastasis in lung adenocarcinoma and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study shows that apelin-13 induced human adenocarcinoma cell migration via the APJ receptor. Apelin-13 phosphorylated PAK1 and cofilin increase the migration of lung adenocarcinoma cells. Moreover, the results verify that over-expression of apelin and APJ contributed to reducing the effect of doxorubicin and razoxane on inhibiting lung adenocarcinoma cells metastasis. Hypoxia activated APJ expression and apelin release in lung adenocarcinoma cells. The results demonstrate a PAK1-cofilin phosphorylation mechanism to mediate lung adenocarcinoma cells migration promoted by apelin-13. This discovery further suggests that APJ and its downstream signalling is a potential target for anti-metastatic therapies in lung adenocarcinoma patients.",

However, its effect on blood pressure (BP) and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, we showed that resistin induces hypertension and IR in wild type (WT) mice, but not in tlr4(-/-) mice. Resistin upregulated angiotensinogen (Agt) expression in WT mice, whereas it had no effect on tlr4(-/-) mice, or in mice treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril. Real-time PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation further confirmed that resistin activates the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) via the TLR4/P65/Agt pathway. This finding suggested an essential role of resistin in linking IR and hypertension, which may offer a novel target in clinic on the study of the association between diabetes and hypertension.",

    "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-based therapy provides a promising avenue for the management of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). However, engrafted MSCs are subjected to acute cell death in the ischemic microenvironment. Apelin has been shown to protect bone marrow MSCs against apoptosis although the mechanism of action remains elusive. Here we demonstrated that apelin promoted functional survival of AD-MSCs in ischemic hindlimbs and provoked a synergetic effect with AD-MSCs to restore hindlimb blood perfusion and limb functions. Further in vitro studies revealed that a biphasic response in autophagy was induced by apelin in AD-MSCs during hypoxia and hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) stages to exert cytoprotective effects against H/R injury. Mechanistically, apelin increased the viability of AD-MSCs via promoting protective autophagy during hypoxia, which was accompanied with activation of AMPK and inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). To the contrary, apelin suppressed autophagic cell death during reoxygenation, which was accompanied with activation of Akt and inhibition of Beclin1. Our findings indicated that apelin facilitated AD-MSCs-based therapy in PAD, possibly through promoting survival of AD-MSCs by way of autophagy regulation. Our data support the promises of apelin as a novel strategy to improve MSC-based therapy for PAD, possibly through autophagy modulation in MSCs.",

    "abstract": "Cryptotanshinone (CT), a major tanshinone found in Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (Lamiaceae), has various pharmacological effects such as antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. Despite its well-documented benefits in a wide range of diseases, the effect of CT on adipocyte differentiation has not been well characterized. The present study was designed to determine the in vitro anti-adipogenic effect and underlying molecular mechanisms of CT using 3T3-L1 murine pre-adipocytes. We measured the levels of intracellular triglyceride accumulation and mRNA and protein expression of key adipogenic transcription factors and their target genes. Treatment with CT drastically reduced lipid accumulation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Molecular assays showed that CT effectively suppressed the expression of C/EBP&#x3b2;, C/EBP&#x3b1;, and PPAR&#x3b3; and of their target adipocyte-specific genes aP2, adiponectin, and GLUT4 but activated the expression of anti-adipogenic genes such as GATA2, CHOP10, and TNF-&#x3b1;. CT treatment also inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT3 in the early phase of adipogenesis. A small-interfering-RNA-mediated knock-down of STAT3 potentiated the anti-adipogenic effect of CT. Taken together, the results suggest that CT may be a good anti-adipogenic candidate because it regulates STAT3 during early adipogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the principal components of the tumor stroma, play a central role in cancer development and progression. As an important regulator of the crosstalk between breast cancer cells and CAFs, the cytokine leptin has been associated to breast carcinogenesis. The nuclear Farnesoid X Receptor-(FXR) seems to exert an oncosuppressive role in different tumors, including breast cancer. Herein, we demonstrated, for the first time, that the synthetic FXR agonist GW4064, inhibiting leptin signaling, affects the tumor-promoting activities of CAFs in breast malignancy. GW4064 inhibited growth, motility and invasiveness induced by leptin as well as by CAF-conditioned media in different breast cancer cell lines. These effects rely on the ability of activated FXR to increase the expression of the suppressor of the cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) leading to inhibition of leptin-activated signaling and downregulation of leptin-target genes. In vivo xenograft studies, using MCF-7 cells alone or co-injected with CAFs, showed that GW4064 administration markedly reduced tumor growth. Interestingly, GW4064-treated tumors exhibited decreased levels of leptin-regulated proteins along with a strong staining intensity for SOCS3. Thus, FXR ligands might represent an emerging potential anti-cancer therapy able to block the tumor supportive role of activated fibroblasts within the breast microenvironment.",

We have constructed a comprehensive map of the molecules reported to be implicated in obesity. A deep curation strategy was complemented by a novel semi-automated text mining system in order to screen 1,000 full-length research articles and over 90,000 abstracts that are relevant to obesity. We obtain a scale free network of 804 nodes and 971 edges, composed of 510 proteins, 115 genes, 62 complexes, 23 RNA molecules, 83 simple molecules, 3 phenotype and 3 drugs in bow-tie architecture. We classify this network into 5 modules and identify new links between the recently discovered fat mass and obesity associated FTO gene with well studied examples such as insulin and leptin. We further built an automated docking pipeline to dock orlistat as well as other drugs against the 24,000 proteins in the human structural proteome to explain the therapeutics and side effects at a network level. Based upon our experiments, we propose that therapeutic effect comes through the binding of one drug with several molecules in target network, and the binding propensity is both statistically significant and different in comparison with any other part of human structural proteome.",

    "title": "Obesity and Breast Cancer: Molecular Interconnections and Potential Clinical Applications.",
    "abstract": "Obesity is an important risk factor for breast cancer (BC) in postmenopausal women; interlinked molecular mechanisms might be involved in the pathogenesis. Increased levels of estrogens due to aromatization of the adipose tissue, inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1;, interleukin-6, and prostaglandin E2, insulin resistance and hyperactivation of insulin-like growth factors pathways, adipokines, and oxidative stress are all abnormally regulated in obese women and contribute to cancerogenesis. These molecular factors interfere with intracellular signaling in the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatydilinositol-3-phosphate/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways, which regulate the progression of the cell cycle, apoptosis, and protein synthesis. In this context, structural defects of typical genes related to both BC and obesity, such as leptin, leptin receptor, serum paraoxonase/arylesterase 1, the fat mass and obesity-associated gene and melanocortin receptor 4, have been associated with a high or low risk of BC development. The early detection of these gene alterations might be useful as risk predictors in obese women, and targeting these pathways involved in the BC pathogenesis in obese women is a potential therapeutic tool. In particular, mTOR pathway deregulation concurs in both obesity and BC, and inhibition of this might disrupt the molecular interlinks in a similar manner to that of metformin, which exerts definite anticancer activity and is currently used as an antidiabetic drug with a weight-reducing property. The identification of both genetic and pharmacological implications on the prevention and management of BC is the ultimate aim of these studies. Obese women are at risk of breast cancer, but clinicians lack concrete tools for the prevention or early diagnosis of this risk. The present study, starting from the biology and the molecular defects characterizing both obesity and breast cancer, analyzed the potential molecules and genetic defects whose early identification could delineate a risk profile. Three steps are proposed that are potentially achievable in the clinical assessment of obese women, namely the evaluation of altered levels of serum molecules, the identification of genetic polymorphisms, and the study of the transcriptomic profile of premalignant lesions. Finally, the therapeutic implications of this molecular assessment were evaluated. &#x6458;&#x8981; &#x80a5;&#x80d6;&#x662f;&#x7edd;&#x7ecf;&#x540e;&#x5973;&#x6027;&#x4e73;&#x817a;&#x764c;&#x7684;&#x91cd;&#x8981;&#x5371;&#x9669;&#x56e0;&#x7d20;, &#x53d1;&#x75c5;&#x673a;&#x5236;&#x53ef;&#x80fd;&#x6d89;&#x53ca;&#x5171;&#x901a;&#x7684;&#x5206;&#x5b50;&#x673a;&#x5236;&#x3002;&#x80a5;&#x80d6;&#x5973;&#x6027;&#x7684;&#x8102;&#x80aa;&#x7ec4;&#x7ec7;&#x82b3;&#x9999;&#x5316;&#x5bfc;&#x81f4;&#x7684;&#x96cc;&#x6fc0;&#x7d20;&#x6c34;&#x5e73;&#x5347;&#x9ad8;&#x3001;&#x708e;&#x6027;&#x7ec6;&#x80de;&#x56e0;&#x5b50;

    "title": "Effective treatment of steatosis and steatohepatitis by fibroblast growth factor 1 in mouse models of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.",
    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disorder and is strongly associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Currently, there is no approved pharmacological treatment for this disease, but improvement of insulin resistance using peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#x3b3; (PPAR&#x3b3;) agonists, such as thiazolidinediones (TZDs), has been shown to reduce steatosis and steatohepatitis effectively and to improve liver function in patients with obesity-related NAFLD. However, this approach is limited by adverse effects of TZDs. Recently, we have identified fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) as a target of nuclear receptor PPAR&#x3b3; in visceral adipose tissue and as a critical factor in adipose remodeling. Because FGF1 is situated downstream of PPAR&#x3b3;, it is likely that therapeutic targeting of the FGF1 pathway will eliminate some of the serious adverse effects associated with TZDs. Here we show that pharmacological administration of recombinant FGF1 (rFGF1) effectively improves hepatic inflammation and damage in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice and in choline-deficient mice, two etiologically different models of NAFLD. Hepatic steatosis was effectively reduced only in ob/ob mice, suggesting that rFGF1 stimulates hepatic lipid catabolism. Potentially adverse effects such as fibrosis or proliferation were not observed in these models. Because the anti-inflammatory effects were observed in both the presence and absence of the antisteatotic effects, our findings further suggest that the anti-inflammatory property of rFGF1 is independent of its effect on lipid catabolism. Our current findings indicate that, in addition to its potent glucose-lowering and insulin-sensitizing effects, rFGF1 could be therapeutically effective in the treatment of NAFLD.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin has been shown to possess potent anti-oxidative properties in various experimental conditions. However, its anti-oxidative effects and underlying mechanisms have not been reported in liver cells. Herein, we investigated the effects of globular adiponectin (gAcrp) on LPS-stimulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and its mechanisms underlying in human hepatic cells (HepG2). Intracellular ROS production was determined by fluorescence of 5-chloromethyl-2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA). NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS formation was determined by lucigenin-derived chemiluminescence. Messenger RNA expression level of target genes was determined by quantitative RT-PCR and protein expression was measured by Western blot analysis. LPS-induced increase in ROS production was prevented by pretreatment with gAcrp in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, gAcrp treatment suppressed LPS-induced activation of NADPH oxidase and increase in mRNA and protein expression of Nox-4. We also found that adiponectin increased expression of FoxO3A and HO-1 and ablation of either of these genes partially restored suppression of LPS-induced ROS production and NADPH oxidase activation by gAcrp, indicating the vital role of FoxO3A and HO-1 signaling in the inhibition of ROS production and NADPH oxidase activation by gAcrp. These results suggest that gAcrp prevents LPS-induced ROS production and NADPH oxidase activity in HepG2 cells via FoxO3A and HO-1 signaling-dependent mechanisms. The present study demonstrated a suppressive effect of adiponectin on ROS production in liver cells and presented a novel mechanism underlying suppression of ROS production by adiponectin.",

    "title": "Establishment of Leptin-Responsive Cell Lines from Adult Mouse Hypothalamus.",
    "abstract": "Leptin resistance is considered to be the primary cause of obesity. However, the cause of leptin resistance remains incompletely understood, and there is currently no cure for the leptin-resistant state. In order to identify novel drug-target molecules that could overcome leptin resistance, it would be useful to develop in vitro assay systems for evaluating leptin resistance. In this study, we established immortalized adult mouse hypothalamus-derived cell lines, termed adult mouse hypothalamus (AMH) cells, by developing transgenic mice in which SV40 Tag was overexpressed in chromogranin A-positive cells in a tamoxifen-dependent manner. In order to obtain leptin-responsive clones, we selected clones based on the phosphorylation levels of STAT3 induced by leptin. The selected clones were fairly responsive to leptin in terms of STAT3, ERK, and Akt phosphorylation and induction of c-Fos mRNA induction. Pretreatment with leptin, insulin, and palmitate attenuated the c-Fos mRNA response to leptin, suggesting that certain aspects of leptin resistance might be reconstituted in this cellular model. These cell lines are useful tools for understanding the molecular nature of the signal disturbance in the leptin-resistant state and for identifying potential target molecules for drugs that relieve leptin resistance, although they have drawbacks including de-differentiated nature and lack of long-time stability.",

    "title": "Effect of Leptin Replacement on PCSK9 in ob/ob Mice and Female Lipodystrophic Patients.",
    "abstract": "Leptin treatment has beneficial effects on plasma lipids in patients with lipodystrophy, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) decreases low-density lipoprotein (LDL) clearance, promotes hypercholesterolemia, and has recently emerged as a novel therapeutic target. To determine the effect of leptin on PCSK9, we treated male and female ob/ob mice with leptin for 4 days via sc osmotic pumps (&#x223c;24 &#x3bc;g/d). Leptin reduced body weight and food intake in all mice, but the effects of leptin on plasma PCSK9 and lipids differed markedly between the sexes. In male mice, leptin suppressed PCSK9 but had no effect on plasma triglycerides or cholesterol. In female mice, leptin suppressed plasma triglycerides and cholesterol but had no effect on plasma PCSK9. In parallel, we treated female lipodystrophic patients (8 females, ages 5-23 y) with sc metreleptin injections (&#x223c;4.4 mg/d) for 4-6 months. In this case, leptin reduced plasma PCSK9 by 26% (298 &#xb1; 109 vs 221 &#xb1; 102 ng/mL; n = 8; P = .008), and the change in PCSK9 was correlated with a decrease in LDL cholesterol (r(2) = 0.564, P = .03). In summary, in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice, the effects of leptin on PCSK9 and plasma lipids appeared to be independent of one another and strongly modified by sex. On the other hand, in lipodystrophic females, leptin treatment reduced plasma PCSK9 in parallel with LDL cholesterol.",

    "title": "Metabolic alterations and hepatitis C: From bench to bedside.",
    "abstract": "In addition to causing cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatitis C virus (HCV) is thought to cause hypolipidemia, hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes. The viral life cycle of HCV depends on cholesterol metabolism in host cells. HCV core protein and nonstructural protein 5A perturb crucial lipid and glucose pathways, such as the sterol regulatory element-binding protein pathway and the protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin/S6 kinase 1 pathway. Although several lines of transgenic mice expressing core or full HCV proteins exhibit hepatic steatosis and/or dyslipidemia, whether they completely reflect the metabolic alterations in humans with HCV infection remains unknown. Many cross-sectional studies have demonstrated increased prevalences of metabolic alterations and cardiovascular events in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC); however, conflicting results exist, primarily due to unavoidable individual variations. Utilizing anti-HCV therapy, most longitudinal cohort studies of CHC patients have demonstrated the favorable effects of viral clearance in attenuating metabolic alterations and cardiovascular risks. To determine the risks of HCV-associated metabolic alterations and associated complications in patients with CHC, it is necessary to adjust for crucial confounders, such as HCV genotype and host baseline glucose metabolism, for a long follow-up period after anti-HCV treatment. Adipose tissue is an important endocrine organ due to its release of adipocytokines, which regulate lipid and glucose metabolism. However, most data on HCV infection and adipocytokine alteration are inconclusive. A comprehensive overview of HCV-associated metabolic and adipocytokine alterations, from bench to bedside, is presented in this topic highlight.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived circulating protein with beneficial effects on injured livers. Adiponectin-deficient (adipo(-/-)) mice develop enhanced liver fibrosis, suggesting that adiponectin could be a therapeutic target for liver injury. In the present study, we investigated the protective role of ADP355, an adiponectin-based active short peptide, in thioacetamide (TAA)-induced acute injury and chronic liver fibrosis in mice. ADP355 remarkably reduced TAA-induced necroinflammation and liver fibrosis. ADP355 treatment increased liver glycogen, decreased serum alanine transaminase and alkaline phosphatase activity, and promoted body weight gain, hyper-proliferation and hypo-apoptosis. In addition, ADP355 administration suppressed the TAA-induced activation of hepatic stellate cells and macrophages in the liver. These were associated with the inactivation of TGF-&#x3b2;1/SMAD2 signaling and the promotion of AMPK and STAT3 signaling. Sensitivity of adipo(-/-) mice to chronic liver injury was decreased with ADP355. In conclusion, ADP355 could mimic adiponectin's action and may be suitable for the preclinical or clinical therapy of chronic liver injury.",

    "title": "Mechanism of Butyrate Stimulation of Triglyceride Storage and Adipokine Expression during Adipogenic Differentiation of Porcine Stromovascular Cells.",
    "abstract": "Short chain fatty acids (SCFA), products of microbial fermentation of dietary fiber, exert multiple metabolic effects in cells. Previously, we had demonstrated that soluble fiber influenced fat mass accumulation, gut microbial community structure and SCFA production in pigs. The current study was designed to identify effects of SCFA treatment during adipogenic differentiation of porcine stromovascular cells on lipid metabolism and adipokine expression. Differentiating cells were treated with varying concentrations of butyrate. Results show that butyrate treatment enhanced adipogenesis and lipid accumulation, perhaps through upregulation of glucose uptake and de novo lipogenesis and other mechanisms that include induction of SREBP-1c, C/EBP&#x3b1;/&#x3b2;, GLUT4, LPL, PPAR&#x3b3;, GPAT4, DGAT1 and DGAT2 expression. In addition, butyrate induced adiponectin expression, resulting in activation of downstream target genes, such as AMPK and AKT. Activation of AMPK by butyrate led to phosphorylation of ACC. Although increased ACO gene expression was seen with butyrate treatment, experiments with the peroxisomal fatty acid inhibitor, thioridazine, suggest that butyrate may have an inhibitory effect on peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation. Our studies also provide evidence that butyrate may inhibit lipolysis, perhaps in an FFAR3-dependent manner. Therefore, this study presents a novel paradigm for butyrate action in adipocytes and shows that adipocytes are capable of utilizing butyrate, leading to increased expression of adiponectin for enhanced glucose uptake and improved insulin sensitivity.",

    "title": "Adiponectin Induces Oncostatin M Expression in Osteoblasts through the PI3K/Akt Signaling Pathway.",
    "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a common autoimmune disorder, is associated with a chronic inflammatory response and unbalanced bone metabolism within the articular microenvironment. Adiponectin, an adipokine secreted by adipocytes, is involved in multiple functions, including lipid metabolism and pro-inflammatory activity. However, the mechanism of adiponectin performance within arthritic inflammation remains unclear. In this study, we observed the effect of adiponectin on the expression of oncostatin M (OSM), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, in human osteoblastic cells. Pretreatment of cells with inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, and nuclear factor (NF)-&#x3ba;B reduced the adiponectin-induced OSM expression in osteoblasts. Stimulation of the cells with adiponectin increased phosphorylation of PI3K, Akt, and p65. Adiponectin treatment of osteoblasts increased OSM-luciferase activity and p65 binding to NF-&#x3ba;B on the OSM promoter. Our results indicate that adiponectin increased OSM expression via the PI3K, Akt, and NF-&#x3ba;B signaling pathways in osteoblastic cells, suggesting that adiponectin is a novel target for arthritis treatment.",

    "abstract": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x3b3; (PPAR&#x3b3;) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily known for its anti-inflammatory and macrophage differentiation effects, as well as its ability to promote fat cell differentiation and reduce insulin resistance. Pioglitazone (Pio) is a PPAR&#x3b3; agonist used clinically as an anti-diabetic agent for improving insulin sensitivity in patients with diabetes. The objective of this study was to develop a drug delivery system (DDS) for the local release of Pio to promote wound healing. Pio of low aqueous solubility was water-solubilized by micelles formed from gelatin grafted with L-lactic acid oligomers, and incorporated into a biodegradable gelatin hydrogel. An 8-mm punch biopsy tool was used to prepare two skin wounds on either side of the midline of 8-week-old mice. Wounds were treated by the hydrogels with (Pio-hydrogel group) or without (control group) Pio, and the wound area were observed 1, 4, 7, and 14 days after treatment. In addition, a protein assay and immunohistological stain were performed to determine the effects of the Pio-hydrogel on inflammation and macrophage differentiation. The Pio-hydrogels promote wound healing. Moreover, Western blotting analysis demonstrated that treatment with Pio-hydrogels resulted in decreased levels of the cytokines MIP-2 and TGF-&#x3b2;, and increased levels of glucose-regulating adiponectin. It is concluded that Pio-incorporated hydrogels promote the proliferation and remodeling phases of wound healing, and may prove to be effective as wound dressings.",

    "abstract": "The present study clones and characterizes the full-length cDNA sequences of members in JAK-STAT pathway, explores their mRNA tissue expression and the biological role in leptin influencing lipid metabolism in yellow catfish Pelteobagrus fulvidraco. Full-length cDNA sequences of five JAKs and seven STAT members, including some splicing variants, were obtained from yellow catfish. Compared to mammals, more members of the JAKs and STATs family were found in yellow catfish, which provided evidence that the JAK and STAT family members had arisen by the whole genome duplications during vertebrate evolution. All of these members were widely expressed across the eleven tissues (liver, white muscle, spleen, brain, gill, mesenteric fat, anterior intestine, heart, mid-kidney, testis and ovary) but at the variable levels. Intraperitoneal injection in vivo and incubation in vitro of recombinant human leptin changed triglyceride content and mRNA expression of several JAKs and STATs members, and genes involved in lipid metabolism. AG490, a specific inhibitor of JAK2-STAT pathway, partially reversed leptin-induced effects, indicating that the JAK2a/b-STAT3 pathway exerts main regulating actions of leptin on lipid metabolism at transcriptional level. Meanwhile, the different splicing variants were differentially regulated by leptin incubation. Thus, our data suggest that leptin activated the JAK/STAT pathway and increases the expression of target genes, which partially accounts for the leptin-induced changes in lipid metabolism in yellow catfish.",

    "abstract": "Myocarditis, which is commonly known as heart inflammation, is a multifaceted disease that includes at least three phases. The host's immune system is mostly active during the first viral and the second autoimmune phase, when several inflammatory pathways are activated. One of the pivotal transcription factors that regulate immune responses is the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#x3ba;B). If, on one side, the acute response to heart injury activates the production of inflammatory cytokines to protect and limit host damage, on the other side sustained and long-term inflammation is one of the leading causes of cardiac hypertrophy and chronic heart failure. An update on the current knowledge of inhibitors and treatments that limit excessive inflammation in experimental and viral autoimmune myocarditis, and therapeutic approaches to cure patients with myocarditis, are described and discussed in this review.",

    "abstract": "The effects of twice-daily GLP-1 analogue injections added on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (T2DM) were unknown. After optimization of blood glucose in the first 3 days by CSII during hospitalization, patients with poorly controlled T2DM were randomized to receive CSII combined with injections of exenatide or placebo for another 3 days. A total of 51 patients (30 in exenatide and 21 in placebo groups) with mean A1C 11% were studied. There was no difference in mean glucose but a significant higher standard deviation of plasma glucose (SDPG) was found in the exenatide group (50.51 &#xb1; 2.43 vs. 41.49 &#xb1; 3.00 mg/dl, p = 0.027). The improvement of incremental area under the curve (AUC) of glucose and insulinogenic index (Insulin 0-peak/ Glucose 0-peak) in 75 g oral glucose tolerance test was prominent in the exenatide group (p &lt; 0.01). The adiponectin level was significantly increased with exenatide added on (0.39 &#xb1; 0.32 vs. -1.62 &#xb1; 0.97 &#x3bc;g/mL, in exenatide and placebo groups, respectively, p = 0.045).

    "title": "Apelin targets gut contraction to control glucose metabolism via the brain.",
    "abstract": "The gut-brain axis is considered as a major regulatory checkpoint in the control of glucose homeostasis. The detection of nutrients and/or hormones in the duodenum informs the hypothalamus of the host's nutritional state. This process may occur via hypothalamic neurons modulating central release of nitric oxide (NO), which in turn controls glucose entry into tissues. The enteric nervous system (ENS) modulates intestinal contractions in response to various stimuli, but the importance of this interaction in the control of glucose homeostasis via the brain is unknown. We studied whether apelin, a bioactive peptide present in the gut, regulates ENS-evoked contractions, thereby identifying a new physiological partner in the control of glucose utilisation via the hypothalamus. We measured the effect of apelin on electrical and mechanical duodenal responses via telemetry probes and isotonic sensors in normal and obese/diabetic mice. Changes in hypothalamic NO release, in response to duodenal contraction modulated by apelin, were evaluated in real time with specific amperometric probes. Glucose utilisation in tissues was measured with orally administrated radiolabeled glucose. In normal and obese/diabetic mice, glucose utilisation is improved by the decrease of ENS/contraction activities in response to apelin, which generates an increase in hypothalamic NO release. As a consequence, glucose entry is significantly increased in the muscle. Here, we identify a novel mode of communication between the intestine and the hypothalamus that controls glucose utilisation. Moreover, our data identified oral apelin administration as a novel potential target to treat metabolic disorders.",

    "title": "Leptin as a mediator of tumor-stromal interactions promotes breast cancer stem cell activity.",
    "abstract": "Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) play crucial roles in tumor initiation, metastasis and therapeutic resistance. A strict dependency between BCSCs and stromal cell components of tumor microenvironment exists. Thus, novel therapeutic strategies aimed to target the crosstalk between activated microenvironment and BCSCs have the potential to improve clinical outcome. Here, we investigated how leptin, as a mediator of tumor-stromal interactions, may affect BCSC activity using patient-derived samples (n = 16) and breast cancer cell lines, and determined the potential benefit of targeting leptin signaling in these model systems. Conditioned media (CM) from cancer-associated fibroblasts and breast adipocytes significantly increased mammosphere formation in breast cancer cells and depletion of leptin from CM completely abrogated this effect. Mammosphere cultures exhibited increased leptin receptor (OBR) expression and leptin exposure enhanced mammosphere formation. Microarray analyses revealed a similar expression profile of genes involved in stem cell biology among mammospheres treated with CM and leptin. Interestingly, leptin increased mammosphere formation in metastatic breast cancers and expression of OBR as well as HSP90, a target of leptin signaling, were directly correlated with mammosphere formation in metastatic samples (r = 0.68/p = 0.05; r = 0.71/p = 0.036, respectively). Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated that OBR and HSP90 expression were associated with reduced overall survival in breast cancer patients (HR = 1.9/p = 0.022; HR = 2.2/p = 0.00017, respectively). Furthermore, blocking leptin signaling by using a full leptin receptor antagonist significantly reduced mammosphere formation in breast cancer cell lines and patient-derived samples. Our results suggest that leptin/leptin receptor signaling may represent a potential therapeutic target that can block the stromal-tumor interactions driving BCSC-mediated disease progression.",

    "title": "Deletion of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1b in proopiomelanocortin neurons reduces neurogenic control of blood pressure and protects mice from leptin- and sympatho-mediated hypertension.",
    "abstract": "Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1b (Ptp1b), which represses leptin signaling, is a promising therapeutic target for obesity. Genome wide deletion of Ptp1b, increases leptin sensitivity, protects mice from obesity and diabetes, but alters cardiovascular function by increasing blood pressure (BP). Leptin-control of metabolism is centrally mediated and involves proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons. Whether these neurons contribute to leptin-mediated increases in BP remain unclear. We hypothesized that increasing leptin signaling in POMC neurons with Ptp1b deletion will sensitize the cardiovascular system to leptin and enhance neurogenic control of BP. We analyzed the cardiovascular phenotype of Ptp1b+/+ and POMC-Ptp1b-/- mice, at baseline and after 7 days of leptin infusion or sympatho-activation with phenylephrine. POMCPtp1b deletion did not alter baseline cardiovascular hemodynamics (BP, heart rate) but reduced BP response to ganglionic blockade and plasma catecholamine levels that suggests a decreased neurogenic control of BP. In contrast, POMC-Ptp1b deletion increased vascular adrenergic reactivity and aortic &#x3b1;-adrenergic receptors expression. Chronic leptin treatment reduced vascular adrenergic reactivity and blunted diastolic and mean BP increases in POMC-Ptp1b-/- mice only. Similarly POMC-Ptp1b-/- mice exhibited a blunted increased in diastolic and mean BP accompanied by a gradual reduction in adrenergic reactivity in response to chronic vascular sympatho-activation with phenylephrine. Together these data rule out our hypothesis but suggest that deletion of Ptp1b in POMC neurons protects from leptin- and sympatho-mediated increases in BP. Vascular adrenergic desensitization appears as a protective mechanism against hypertension, and POMC-Ptp1b as a key therapeutic target for the treatment of metabolic and cardiovascular dysfunctions associated with obesity.",

    "abstract": "Although recent studies have reported cardioprotective effects of C1q/TNF-related protein 9 (CTRP9), the closet adiponectin paralog, its role on cytokine-induced endothelial inflammation is unknown. We investigated whether CTRP9 prevented inflammatory cytokine-induced nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-&#x3ba;B) activation and inhibited the expression of adhesion molecules and a chemokine in the vascular endothelial cell. We used human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) to examine the effects of CTRP9 on NF-&#x3ba;B activation and the expression of NF-&#x3ba;B-mediated genes, including intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#x3b1;) was used as a representative proinflammatory cytokine. In an adhesion assay using THP-1 cells, CTRP9 reduced TNF&#x3b1;-induced adhesion of monocytes to HAECs. Treatment with CTRP9 significantly decreased TNF&#x3b1;-induced activation of NF-&#x3ba;B, as well as the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and MCP-1. In addition, treatment with CTRP9 significantly increased the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), the downstream target of AMPK. The inhibitory effect of CTRP9 on the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and MCP-1 and monocyte adhesion to HAECs was abolished after transfection with an AMPK&#x3b1;1-specific siRNA. Our study is the first to demonstrate that CTRP9 attenuates cytokine-induced vascular inflammation in endothelial cells mediated by AMPK activation.",

    "title": "Increased Sensitivity to Binge Alcohol-Induced Gut Leakiness and Inflammatory Liver Disease in HIV Transgenic Rats.",
    "abstract": "The mechanisms of alcohol-mediated advanced liver injury in HIV-infected individuals are poorly understood. Thus, this study was aimed to investigate the effect of binge alcohol on the inflammatory liver disease in HIV transgenic rats as a model for simulating human conditions. Female wild-type (WT) or HIV transgenic rats were treated with three consecutive doses of binge ethanol (EtOH) (3.5 g/kg/dose oral gavages at 12-h intervals) or dextrose (Control). Blood and liver tissues were collected at 1 or 6-h following the last dose of ethanol or dextrose for the measurements of serum endotoxin and liver pathology, respectively. Compared to the WT, the HIV rats showed increased sensitivity to alcohol-mediated gut leakiness, hepatic steatosis and inflammation, as evidenced with the significantly elevated levels of serum endotoxin, hepatic triglycerides, histological fat accumulation and F4/80 staining. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that hepatic levels of toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4), leptin and the downstream target monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were significantly up-regulated in the HIV-EtOH rats, compared to all other groups. Subsequent experiments with primary cultured cells showed that both hepatocytes and hepatic Kupffer cells were the sources of the elevated MCP-1 in HIV-EtOH rats. Further, TLR4 and MCP-1 were found to be upregulated by leptin. Collectively, these results show that HIV rats, similar to HIV-infected people being treated with the highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), are more susceptible to binge alcohol-induced gut leakiness and inflammatory liver disease than the corresponding WT, possibly due to additive or synergistic interaction between binge alcohol exposure and HIV infection. Based on these results, HIV transgenic rats can be used as a surrogate model to study the molecular mechanisms of many disease states caused by heavy alcohol intake in HIV-infected people on HAART.",

    "abstract": "Leptin is viewed as an important target for developing novel therapeutics for obesity, depression/anxiety and cognitive dysfunctions. The present study therefore concerns behavioral, hormonal and central serotonin modulating effects of systemically injected leptin. Pharmacological doses (100 and 500 &#x3bc;g/kg) of leptin injected systemically decreased 24h cumulative food intake and body weight in freely feeding rats and improved acquisition and retention of memory in Morris water maze test. Potential anxiety reducing, hormonal and serotonin modulating effects of the peptide hormone were determined in a separate experiment. Animals injected with 100 or 500 &#x3bc;g/kg leptin were tested for anxiety in an elevated plus maze test 1h later. A significant increase in the number of entries and time passed in open arm of the elevated plus maze in leptin injected animals suggested pronounced anxiety reducing effect. Moreover, circulating levels of leptin correlated significantly with anxiety reducing effects of the peptide hormone. Serum serotonin increased and ghrelin decreased in leptin injected animals and correlated, positively and negatively respectively, with circulating leptin. Corticosterone increased at low dose and levels were normal at higher dose. Serotonin metabolism in the hypothalamus and hippocampus decreased only at higher dose of leptin. The results support a role of leptin in the treatment of obesity, anxiety and cognitive dysfunctions. It is suggested that hormonal and serotonin modulating effects of leptin can alter treatment efficacy in particularly comorbid conditions.",

    "title": "Pharmacokinetics of leptin in female mice.",
    "abstract": "Pharmacokinetics of leptin in mammals has received limited attention and only one study has examined more than two time points and this was in ob/ob mice. This study is the first to observe the distribution of leptin over a time course in female mice. A physiologic dose (12 ng) of radiolabelled leptin was injected in adult female mice via the lateral tail vein and tissues were dissected out and measured for radioactivity over a time course up to two hours. Major targets for administered leptin included the liver, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract and the skin while the lungs had high concentrations of administered leptin per gram of tissue. Leptin was also found to enter the lumen of the digestive tract intact from the plasma. Very little of the dose (&lt;1 %) was recovered from the brain at any time. Consequently we confirm that the brain is not a major target for leptin from the periphery, although it may be very sensitive to leptin that does get to the hypothalamus. Several of the major targets (GI tract, skin and lungs) for leptin form the interface for the body with the environment, and given the ability of leptin to modulate immune function, this may represent a priming effect for tissues to respond to damage and infection.",

    "title": "Adiponectin supplementation in pregnant mice prevents the adverse effects of maternal obesity on placental function and fetal growth.",
    "abstract": "Mothers with obesity or gestational diabetes mellitus have low circulating levels of adiponectin (ADN) and frequently deliver large babies with increased fat mass, who are susceptible to perinatal complications and to development of metabolic syndrome later in life. It is currently unknown if the inverse correlation between maternal ADN and fetal growth reflects a cause-and-effect relationship. We tested the hypothesis that ADN supplementation in obese pregnant dams improves maternal insulin sensitivity, restores normal placental insulin/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and nutrient transport, and prevents fetal overgrowth. Compared with dams on a control diet, female C57BL/6J mice fed an obesogenic diet before mating and throughout gestation had increased fasting serum leptin, insulin, and C-peptide, and reduced high-molecular-weight ADN at embryonic day (E) 18.5. Placental insulin and mTORC1 signaling was activated, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#x3b1; (PPAR&#x3b1;) phosphorylation was reduced, placental transport of glucose and amino acids in vivo was increased, and fetal weights were 29% higher in obese dams. Maternal ADN infusion in obese dams from E14.5 to E18.5 normalized maternal insulin sensitivity, placental insulin/mTORC1 and PPAR&#x3b1; signaling, nutrient transport, and fetal growth without affecting maternal fat mass. Using a mouse model with striking similarities to obese pregnant women, we demonstrate that ADN functions as an endocrine link between maternal adipose tissue and fetal growth by regulating placental function. Importantly, maternal ADN supplementation reversed the adverse effects of maternal obesity on placental function and fetal growth. Improving maternal ADN levels may serve as an effective intervention strategy to prevent fetal overgrowth caused by maternal obesity.",

    "title": "DHEA Administration Activates Transcription of Muscular Lipid Metabolic Enzymes via PPAR&#x3b1; and PPAR&#x3b4; in Obese Rats.",
    "abstract": "Administration of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a precursor of sex steroid hormones, reduces total and visceral fat mass and elevates adipocytic adiponectin gene expression. The aim of this study is to investigate whether levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) in muscle and transcription of PPAR target genes are affected by long-term DHEA administration or exercise training, and whether altered PPAR levels are associated with circulating adiponectin level in obese rats. After 14 weeks on a high-sucrose diet, obese male Wistar rats were assigned randomly to one of 3 groups: control, DHEA administration (1 mg/kg body weight), or exercise training (treadmill running for 1&#x2009;h, 25&#x2009;m/min, 5 days/week) for 6 weeks (n=7 for each group). Plasma DHEA and total adiponectin levels in the DHEA-treated and exercise-training groups were significantly higher than those in the obese control group. Additionally, DHEA administration and exercise training significantly increased muscular PPAR&#x3b1; and PPAR&#x3b4; protein levels, with a concomitant increase in mRNA expression of 3&#x3b2;-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and cytochrome c oxidase IV, which are target genes of PPAR&#x3b1; and PPAR&#x3b4; respectively. Moreover, DHEA administration increased these protein and mRNA levels to the same degree as exercise training. Circulating adiponectin level was positively correlated with plasma DHEA and with muscle levels of PPAR&#x3b1; and PPAR&#x3b4;. These results suggest that in obese rats, secretion of adiponectin due to chronic DHEA administration and exercise training may contribute to an increase in the transcription of genes encoding lipid metabolic enzymes, mediated via elevated expression of PPAR&#x3b1; and PPAR&#x3b4; in muscle.",

    "abstract": "Apelin-13, an adipokine, promotes cholesterol efflux in macrophages with antiatherosclerotic effect. Autophagy, an evolutionarily ancient response to cellular stress, has been involved in atherosclerosis. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether apelin-13 regulates macrophage foam cell cholesterol metabolism through autophagy, and also explore the underlying mechanisms. Here, we revealed that apelin-13 decreased lipid accumulation in THP-1 derived macrophages through markedly enhancing cholesterol efflux. Our study further demonstrated that apelin-13 induced autophagy via activation of Class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Beclin-1. Inhibition of Class III PI3K and Beclin-1 suppressed the stimulatory effects of apelin-13 on autophagy activity. The present study concluded that apelin-13 reduces lipid accumulation of foam cells by activating autophagy via Class III PI3K/Beclin-1 pathway. Therefore, our results provide brand new insight about apelin-13 inhibiting foam cell formation and highlight autophagy as a promising therapeutic target in atherosclerosis.",

    "title": "Perhexiline activates KLF14 and reduces atherosclerosis by modulating ApoA-I production.",
    "abstract": "Recent genome-wide association studies have revealed that variations near the gene locus encoding the transcription factor Kr&#xfc;ppel-like factor 14 (KLF14) are strongly associated with HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, metabolic syndrome, and coronary heart disease. However, the precise mechanisms by which KLF14 regulates lipid metabolism and affects atherosclerosis remain largely unexplored. Here, we report that KLF14 is dysregulated in the liver of 2 dyslipidemia mouse models. We evaluated the effects of both KLF14 overexpression and genetic inactivation and determined that KLF14 regulates plasma HDL-C levels and cholesterol efflux capacity by modulating hepatic ApoA-I production. Hepatic-specific Klf14 deletion in mice resulted in decreased circulating HDL-C levels. In an attempt to pharmacologically target KLF14 as an experimental therapeutic approach, we identified perhexiline, an approved therapeutic small molecule presently in clinical use to treat angina and heart failure, as a KLF14 activator. Indeed, in WT mice, treatment with perhexiline increased HDL-C levels and cholesterol efflux capacity via KLF14-mediated upregulation of ApoA-I expression. Moreover, perhexiline administration reduced atherosclerotic lesion development in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. Together, these results provide comprehensive insight into the KLF14-dependent regulation of HDL-C and subsequent atherosclerosis and indicate that interventions that target the KLF14 pathway should be further explored for the treatment of atherosclerosis.",

    "abstract": "It's known that blood leptin level is reduced in intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) fetus, and placental leptin is the major source of fetal blood leptin. This study aimed to investigate the decreased fetal blood leptin level by prenatal caffeine exposure (PCE) and its underlying placental mechanisms. Pregnant Wistar rats were intragastrically administered caffeine (30-120 mg/kg day) from gestational day 9 to 20. The level of fetal serum leptin and the expression of placental leptin-related genes were analyzed. Furthermore, we investigated the molecular mechanism of the reduced placental leptin's expression by treatment with caffeine (0.8-20 &#x3bc;M) in the BeWo cells. In vivo, PCE significantly decreased fetal serum leptin level in caffeine dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, placental mRNA expression of adenosine A2a receptor (Adora2a), cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB), a short-type leptin receptor (Ob-Ra) and leptin was reduced in the PCE groups. In vitro, caffeine significantly decreased the mRNA expression of leptin, CREB and ADORA2A in concentration and time-dependent manners. The addition of ADORA2A agonist or adenylyl cyclase (AC) agonist reversed the inhibition of leptin expression induced by caffeine. PCE induced a lower level of fetal blood leptin, which the primary mechanism is that caffeine inhibited antagonized Adora2a and AC activities to decreased cAMP synthesis, thus inhibited the expression of the transcription factor CREB and target gene leptin in the placenta. Meantime, the reduced transportation of maternal leptin by placental Ob-Ra also contributed to the reduced fetal blood leptin. Together, PCE decreased fetal blood leptin mainly via reducing the expression and transportation of leptin in the placenta.",

    "title": "Adiponectin-Mediated Analgesia and Anti-Inflammatory Effects in Rat.",
    "abstract": "The adipose tissue-derived protein, adiponectin, has significant anti-inflammatory properties in a variety of disease conditions. Recent evidence that adiponectin and its receptors (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2) are expressed in central nervous system, suggests that it may also have a central modulatory role in pain and inflammation. This study set out to investigate the effects of exogenously applied recombinant adiponectin (via intrathecal and intraplantar routes; 10-5000 ng) on the development of peripheral inflammation (paw oedema) and pain hypersensitivity in the rat carrageenan model of inflammation. Expression of adiponectin, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 mRNA and protein was characterised in dorsal spinal cord using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blotting. AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 mRNA and protein were found to be constitutively expressed in dorsal spinal cord, but no change in mRNA expression levels was detected in response to carrageenan-induced inflammation. Adiponectin mRNA, but not protein, was detected in dorsal spinal cord, although levels were very low. Intrathecal administration of adiponectin, both pre- and 3 hours post-carrageenan, significantly attenuated thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical hypersensitivity. Intrathecal administration of adiponectin post-carrageenan also reduced peripheral inflammation. Intraplantar administration of adiponectin pre-carrageenan dose-dependently reduced thermal hyperalgesia but had no effect on mechanical hypersensitivity and peripheral inflammation. These results show that adiponectin functions both peripherally and centrally at the spinal cord level, likely through activation of AdipoRs to modulate pain and peripheral inflammation. These data suggest that adiponectin receptors may be a novel therapeutic target for pain modulation.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin is a circulating hormone with pleiotropic functions in lipid and glucose metabolism secreted by adipocytes. It plays a beneficial role in cardiovascular functions and metabolic complications. Recently, growing researches have elucidated that increased adiponectin plasma levels correlate with severity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and it is speculative that adiponectin may link to RA. The association of adiponectin with potential inflammatory functions in RA has raised significant interests in exploring this adipokine as a target for RA-diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Despite significant advances in understanding adiponectin functions and signaling mechanisms, its roles in RA remain multifaceted and subject to controversy. This review highlights the evidences linking adiponectin to either anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory action in RA. The results of this review may provide important insight into adiponectin in the development of RA.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is in the third place of the most common cancers. Certain risk factors can increase the development of CRC, including diet and inheritance. Several studies have shown that there is a potential link between obesity and CRC. Adipose tissue is known to be a largest endocrine organ in the body, with the ability to produce various cytokines including adiponectin. Two types of adiponectin receptor, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, have been detected in various cancer tissues such as CRC. There is mounting evidence that AdipoR1 signaling occurs mainly through 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and adiponectin inhibits colorectal cancer cell growth via activation of AMPK, thereby suppression of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Thus, adiponectin replacement-based therapies may represent a novel approach in CRC cell growth inhibition in early stages. AdipoRon is an adiponectin-like synthetic small molecule that activated both adiponectin receptors 1 and 2. We hypothesize that AdipoRon has antiproliferative effects of adiponectin and may suppress the CRC cell growth. With clarification of this drug's role in CRC, it can be used as chemoprevention in patients at risk of developing the disease.",

    "abstract": "In models of metabolic disorders, cinnamon improves glucose and lipid metabolism. This study explores the effect of chronic supplementation with aqueous cinnamon extract (CE) on the lipid metabolism of rats. Male adult Wistar rats were separated into a control group (CTR) receiving water and a CE Group receiving aqueous cinnamon extract (400 mg of cinnamon per kg body mass per day) by gavage for 25 consecutive days. Cinnamon supplementation did not change the food intake or the serum lipid profile but promoted the following changes: lower body mass gain (P = 0.008), lower relative mass of white adipose tissue (WAT) compartments (P = 0.045) and higher protein content (percentage of the carcass) (P = 0.049). The CE group showed lower leptin mRNA expression in the WAT (P = 0.0017) and an important tendency for reduced serum leptin levels (P = 0.059). Cinnamon supplementation induced lower mRNA expression of SREBP1c (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c) in the WAT (P = 0.001) and liver (P = 0.013) and lower mRNA expression of SREBP2 (P = 0.002), HMGCoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase) (P = 0.0003), ACAT1 (acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1) (P = 0.032) and DGAT2 (diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2) (P = 0.03) in the liver. These changes could be associated with the reduced esterified cholesterol and triacylglycerol content detected in this tissue. Our results suggest that chronic ingestion of aqueous cinnamon extract attenuates lipogenic processes, regulating the expression of key enzymes and transcriptional factors and their target genes, which are directly involved in lipogenesis. These molecular changes possibly promote adaptations that would prevent an increase in circulating cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels and prevent lipid accumulation in tissues, such as liver and WAT. Therefore, we speculate that cinnamon may also be useful for preventing or retarding the development of lipid disorders.",

Moreover, the roles of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x3b3; (PPAR&#x3b3;) and AMPK activation in mediating n-3 PUFAs actions on adipose tissue functions are discussed. Finally, the mechanisms underlying the ability of n-3 PUFAs to prevent and/or ameliorate adipose tissue inflammation are also revised, focusing on the role of n-3 PUFAs-derived specialized proresolving lipid mediators such as resolvins, protectins and maresins.",

    "title": "Impairment of Liver Glycogen Storage in the db/db Animal Model of Type 2 Diabetes: A Potential Target for Future Therapeutics?",
    "abstract": "After the discovery of the db gene in 1966, it was determined that a blood-borne satiety factor was produced excessively, but was not responded to, in db/db mice. This model for type 2 diabetes is widely used since it phenocopies human disease and its co-morbidities including obesity, progressive deterioration in glucose tolerance, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. Db/db mice, unlike their non-diabetic controls, have consistently elevated levels of liver glycogen, most likely due to hyperphagia. In transmission electron micrographs, liver glycogen usually shows a composite cauliflower-like morphology of large &#x3b1; particles (with a wide range of sizes) made up of smaller &#x3b2; particles bound together. New studies have explored the size distribution of liver glycogen molecules and found that &#x3b1; particles in db/db mice are more chemically fragile than those in healthy mice, and can readily break apart to smaller &#x3b2; particles. There is evidence that smaller glycogen particles have a higher association with glycogen phosphorylase, a key enzyme involved in glycogen degradation, as well as being degraded more rapidly in vitro; therefore the inability to form stable large glycogen &#x3b1; particles is predicted to result in a faster, less controlled degradation into glucose. The implications of this for glycaemic control remain to be fully elucidated. However, rescuing the more fragile diabetic glycogen to decrease hepatic glucose output in type 2 diabetes, may provide a potential therapeutic target which is the subject of this review.",

    "title": "Adiponectin attenuates liver fibrosis by inducing nitric oxide production of hepatic stellate cells.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin protects against liver fibrosis, but the mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Here, we showed that adiponectin upregulated inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression in hepatic non-parenchymal cells, particularly in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and increased nitric oxide (NO2-/NO3-) concentration in HSC-conditioned medium. Adiponectin attenuated HSC proliferation and migration but promoted apoptosis in a NO-dependent manner. More advanced liver fibrosis with decreased iNOS/NO levels was observed in adiponectin knockout mice comparing to wide-type mice when administered with CCI4 while NO donor supplementation rescued the phenotype. Further experiments demonstrated that adiponectin-induced iNOS/NO system activation is mediated through adipoR2-AMPK-JNK/Erk1/2-NF-&#x3ba;B signaling. These data suggest that adiponectin inhibits HSC function, further limiting the development of liver fibrosis at least in part through adiponectin-induced NO release. Therefore, adiponectin-mediated NO signaling may be a novel target for the treatment of liver fibrosis. &#x2022; Adiponectin activates HSC iNOS/NO and SEC eNOS/NO systems. &#x2022; Adiponectin inhibits HSC proliferation and migration but promotes its apoptosis. &#x2022; Adiponectin inhibits CCL4-induced liver fibrosis by modulation of liver iNOS/NO. &#x2022; Adiponectin stimulates HSC iNOS/NO via adipoR2-AMPK-JNK/ErK1/2-NF-&#x3ba;B pathway.",

    "title": "Fucoxanthin and lipid metabolism: A minireview.",
    "abstract": "Accumulating data suggest that food supplementation with seaweeds which traditionally are an important part of food culture in South-East Asian countries might lead to essential health benefits. In this short review, we summarize findings from experimental studies on the effects of fucoxanthin (a carotenoid derived from brown seaweeds) on lipid metabolism, adiposity, and related conditions and discuss the possible underlying mechanisms. Supplementation of fucoxanthin or its derivatives consistently attenuated body and visceral fat weight gain, lipid accumulation in the liver, decreases insulin resistance, and improves the plasma lipid profile in rodents fed a high-fat diet. It should however be noted that in diabetic/obese KK-Ay mice with genetically compromised insulin signaling, fucoxanthin might increase the plasma levels of cholesterol and low-density lipoproteins. The anti-obesity effects of fucoxanthin are apparently mediated by the hormones leptin and adiponectin through their common target AMK-activated protein kinase, resulting in downregulation of lipogenic enzymes and upregulation of lipolytic enzymes. Fucoxanthin also suppresses adipocyte differentiation and induces the expression of uncoupling proteins in visceral adipose tissue. The results of experimental studies suggest that consumption of fucoxanthin and its derivatives as nutritional supplements is a promising option for prevention and treatment of obesity and a wide variety of related pathologies, including metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. Yet, clinical trials are warranted to assess a therapeutic value of fucoxanthin.",

    "title": "Translocator protein (18 kDa) as a pharmacological target in adipocytes to regulate glucose homeostasis.",
    "abstract": "As a major regulator in obesity and its associated metabolic complications, the proper functioning of adipocytes is crucial for health maintenance, thus serving as an important target for the development of anti-obese and anti-diabetic therapies. There is increasing evidence that mitochondrial malfunction is a pivotal event in disturbing adipocyte cell homeostasis. Among major mitochondrial structure components, the high-affinity drug- and cholesterol-binding outer mitochondrial membrane translocator protein (18 kDa; TSPO) has shown importance across a broad spectrum of mitochondrial functions. Recent studies demonstrated the presence of TSPO in white adipocyte mitochondria of mice, and administration of TSPO drug ligands to obese mice reduced weight gain and lowered glucose level. Therefore, it is of great interest to assess whether TSPO in adipocytes could serve as a drug target to regulate adipocyte activities with potential influence on weight control and glucose metabolism. Two structurally distinct TSPO drug ligands, PK 11195 and FGIN-1-27, improved the intracellular dynamics of 3T3-L1 adipocytes, such as the production and release of adipokines, glucose uptake, and adipogenesis. TSPO knockdown in either differentiated adipocytes or preadipocytes impaired these functions. Findings from 3T3-L1 cells were related to human primary cells, where TSPO expression was tightly associated with the metabolic state of primary adipocytes and the differentiation of primary preadipocytes. These results suggest that TSPO expression is essential to safeguard healthy adipocyte functions, and that TSPO activation in adipocytes improves their metabolic status in regulating glucose homeostasis. Adipocyte TSPO may serve as a pharmacologic target for the treatment of obesity and diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Melatonin is synthesized in the pineal gland, but elicits a wide range of physiological responses in peripheral target tissues. Recent advances suggest that melatonin controls adiposity, resulting in changes in body weight. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of melatonin on adipogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis in 3T3-L1 mouse embryo fibroblasts. Melatonin significantly increased the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#x3b3; (PPAR-&#x3b3;), a master regulator of adipogenesis, and promoted differentiation into adipocytes. Melatonin-treated cells also formed smaller lipid droplets and abundantly expressed several molecules associated with lipolysis, including adipose triglyceride lipase, perilipin, and comparative gene identification-58. Moreover, the hormone promoted biogenesis of mitochondria, as indicated by fluorescent staining, elevated the citrate synthase activity, and upregulated the expression of PPAR-&#x3b3; coactivator 1 &#x3b1;, nuclear respiratory factor-1, and transcription factor A. The expression of uncoupling protein 1 was also observable both at mRNA and at protein level in melatonin-treated cells. Finally, adiponectin secretion and the expression of adiponectin receptors were enhanced. These results suggest that melatonin promotes adipogenesis, lipolysis, mitochondrial biogenesis, and adiponectin secretion. Thus, melatonin has potential as an anti-obesity agent that may reverse obesity-related disorders.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have revealed that leptin may be involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a crucial initiator of cancer progression to facilitate metastatic cascade, increase tumor recurrence, and ultimately cause poor prognosis. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The aim of our present study was to investigate the effect of leptin on EMT of breast cancer cells and the underlying mechanism. Our data demonstrated that leptin significantly increased the phosphorylation of STAT3, Akt, and ERK1/2, elevated the expression of IL-8, and induced breast cancer cells to undergo EMT. The effect of leptin on IL-8 could visibly abolished by the inhibitor of PI3K LY294002. In addition, leptin-induced EMT of breast cancer cells was blocked by anti-IL-8 antibodies. Examination of the expression of ObR, leptin, IL-8 and EMT-related biomarkers in patient specimens demonstrated that malignant breast carcinoma with lymph node metastases (LNM), which represents poor prognosis, expressed higher levels of ObR, leptin, IL-8 than other types of breast cancer, and displayed more obvious EMT transversion. In vivo xenograft experiment revealed that leptin signally promoted tumor growth and metastasis and increased the expressions of IL-8 and EMT-related biomarkers. Our results support that leptin-induced EMT in breast cancer cells requires IL-8 activation via the PI3K/Akt signal pathway.",

    "title": "Muscle transcriptome response to ACTH administration in a free-ranging marine mammal.",
    "abstract": "While much of our understanding of stress physiology is derived from biomedical studies, little is known about the downstream molecular consequences of adaptive stress responses in free-living animals. We examined molecular effectors of the stress hormones cortisol and aldosterone in the northern elephant seal, a free-ranging study system in which extreme physiological challenges and cortisol fluctuations are a routine part of life history. We stimulated the neuroendocrine stress axis by administering exogenous adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and examined the resultant effects by measuring corticosteroid hormones, metabolites, and gene expression before, during, and following administration. ACTH induced an elevation in cortisol, aldosterone, glucose, and fatty acids within 2 h, with complete recovery observed within 24 h of administration. The global transcriptional response of elephant seal muscle tissue to ACTH was evaluated by transcriptomics and involved upregulation of a highly coordinated network of conserved glucocorticoid (GC) target genes predicted to promote metabolic substrate availability without causing deleterious effects seen in laboratory animals. Transcriptional recovery from ACTH was characterized by downregulation of GC target genes and restoration of cell proliferation, metabolism, and tissue maintenance pathways within 24 h. Differentially expressed genes included several adipokines not previously described in muscle, reflecting unique metabolic physiology in fasting-adapted animals. This study represents one of the first transcriptome analyses of cellular responses to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis stimulation in a free-living marine mammal and suggests that compensatory, tissue-sparing mechanisms may enable marine mammals to maintain cortisol and aldosterone sensitivity while avoiding deleterious long-term consequences of stress.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling of the adipose tissue plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of obesity. The lysyl oxidase (LOX) family of amine oxidases, including LOX and LOX-like (LOXL) isoenzymes, controls ECM maturation, and upregulation of LOX activity is essential in fibrosis; however, its involvement in adipose tissue dysfunction in obesity is unclear. In this study, we observed that LOX is the main isoenzyme expressed in human adipose tissue and that its expression is strongly upregulated in samples from obese individuals that had been referred to bariatric surgery. LOX expression was also induced in the adipose tissue from male Wistar rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Interestingly, treatment with &#x3b2;-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), a specific and irreversible inhibitor of LOX activity, attenuated the increase in body weight and fat mass that was observed in obese animals and shifted adipocyte size toward smaller adipocytes. BAPN also ameliorated the increase in collagen content that was observed in adipose tissue from obese animals and improved several metabolic parameters - it ameliorated glucose and insulin levels, decreased homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index and reduced plasma triglyceride levels. Furthermore, in white adipose tissue from obese animals, BAPN prevented the downregulation of adiponectin and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), as well as the increase in suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) levels, triggered by the HFD. Likewise, in the TNF&#x3b1;-induced insulin-resistant 3T3-L1 adipocyte model, BAPN prevented the downregulation of adiponectin and GLUT4 and the increase in SOCS3 levels, and consequently normalised insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Therefore, our data provide evidence that LOX plays a pathologically relevant role in the metabolic dysfunction induced by obesity and emphasise the interest of novel pharmacological interventions that target adipose tissue fibrosis and LOX activity for the clinical management of this disease.",

    "abstract": "Altered adiponectin signaling and chronic sympathetic hyperactivity have both been proposed as key factors in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome. We recently reported that activation of I1 imidazoline receptors (I1R) improves several symptoms of the metabolic syndrome through sympathoinhibition and increases adiponectin plasma levels in a rat model of metabolic syndrome (Fellmann L, Regnault V, Greney H, et al. J Pharmacol Exp Ther 346: 370-380, 2013). The present study was designed to explore the peripheral component of the beneficial actions of I1R ligands (i.e., sympathoinhibitory independent effects). Aged rats displaying insulin resistance and glucose intolerance were treated with LNP509, a peripherally acting I1R agonist. Glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and adiponectin signaling were assessed at the end of the treatment. Direct actions of the ligand on hepatocyte and adipocyte signaling were also studied. LNP509 reduced the area under the curve of the intravenous glucose tolerance test and enhanced insulin hypoglycemic action and intracellular signaling (Akt phosphorylation), indicating improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. LNP509 stimulated adiponectin secretion acting at I1R on adipocytes, resulting in increased plasma levels of adiponectin; it also enhanced AMPK phosphorylation in hepatic tissues. Additionally, I1R activation on hepatocytes directly enhanced AMPK phosphorylation. To conclude, I1R ligands can improve insulin sensitivity acting peripherally, independently of sympathoinhibition; stimulation of adiponectin and AMPK pathways at insulin target tissues may account for this effect. This may open a promising new way for the treatment of the metabolic syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Survivin is an independent prognostic factor for joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the expression and function of survivin in RA synoviocytes remain unclear. We certified the expression of survivin in RA synovial tissues and performed the experiment using RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLS) treated with siRNA. As a result, the expression levels of wild type (WT) survivin and the 2B splice variants in RA synovial tissues were higher than those in osteoarthritis tissue samples, and, these variants were highly expressed in RA-FLS. The expression levels of survivin-WT and -2B in the RA-FLS were upregulated by PDGF. Treatment with siRNA against survivin-2B led to decreased viability of PDGF-treated RA-FLS due to cell cycle suppression and apoptosis promotion, while the siRNA against all survivin isoforms did not affect the viability. Moreover, an overexpression of survivin-2B in RA-FLS led to cell proliferation through cell cycle activation and by conferring resistance to apoptosis. In conclusion, survivin-2B has an important role in RA-FLS proliferation. These data suggest that survivin-2B might contribute to rheumatoid synovial hyperplasia, and have the potential as a novel therapeutic target for RA.",

    "abstract": "All of life is regulated by complex and organized chemical reactions that help dictate when to grow, to move, to reproduce, and to die. When these processes go awry, or are interrupted by pathological agents, diseases such as cancer, autoimmunity, or infections can result. Cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, adipokines, and other chemical moieties make up a vast subset of these chemical reactions that are altered in disease states, and monitoring changes in these molecules could provide for the identification of disease biomarkers. From the first identification of carcinoembryonic antigen, to the discovery of prostate-specific antigen, to numerous others described within, biomarkers of disease are detectable in a plethora of sample types. The growing number of biomarkers for infection, autoimmunity, and cancer allow for increasingly early detection, to identification of novel drug targets, to prognostic indicators of disease outcome. However, more and more studies are finding that a single cytokine or growth factor is insufficient as a true disease biomarker and that a more global perspective is needed to understand true disease biology. Such a broad view requires a multiplexed platform for chemical detection, and antibody arrays meet and exceed this need by performing this detection in a high-throughput fashion. Herein, we will discuss how antibody arrays have evolved, and how they have helped direct new drug target design, helped identify therapeutic disease markers, and helped in earlier disease detection. From asthma to renal disease, and neurological dysfunction to immunologic disorders, antibody arrays afford a bright future for new biomarkers discovery.",

    "title": "Astrocytes control food intake by inhibiting AGRP neuron activity via adenosine A1 receptors.",
    "abstract": "It is well recognized that feeding behavior in mammals is orchestrated by neurons within the medial basal hypothalamus. However, it remains unclear whether food intake is also under the control of glial cells. Here, we combine chemical genetics, cell-type-specific electrophysiology, pharmacology, and feeding assays to show that stimulation of astrocytes within the medial basal hypothalamus reduces both basal- and ghrelin-evoked food intake. This occurs by a mechanism of adenosine-mediated inactivation of the orexigenic agouti-related peptide (AGRP) neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) via adenosine A1 receptors. Our data suggest that glial cells participate in regulating food intake by modulating extracellular levels of adenosine. These findings reveal the existence of a glial relay circuit that controls feeding behavior, one that might serve as a target for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of appetite disorders.",

    "title": "Adipokines as drug targets in diabetes and underlying disturbances.",
    "abstract": "Diabetes and obesity are worldwide health problems. White fat dynamically participates in hormonal and inflammatory regulation. White adipose tissue is recognized as a multifactorial organ that secretes several adipose-derived factors that have been collectively termed adipokines. Adipokines are pleiotropic molecules that gather factors such as leptin, adiponectin, visfatin, apelin, vaspin, hepcidin, RBP4, and inflammatory cytokines, including TNF and IL-1&#x3b2;, among others. Multiple roles in metabolic and inflammatory responses have been assigned to these molecules. Several adipokines contribute to the self-styled low-grade inflammatory state of obese and insulin-resistant subjects, inducing the accumulation of metabolic anomalies within these individuals, including autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Thus, adipokines are an interesting drug target to treat autoimmune diseases, obesity, insulin resistance, and adipose tissue inflammation. The aim of this review is to present an overview of the roles of adipokines in different immune and nonimmune cells, which will contribute to diabetes as well as to adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance development. We describe how adipokines regulate inflammation in these diseases and their therapeutic implications. We also survey current attempts to exploit adipokines for clinical applications, which hold potential as novel approaches to drug development in several immune-mediated diseases.",

    "title": "Adipogenic RNAs are transferred in osteoblasts via bone marrow adipocytes-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs).",
    "abstract": "In osteoporosis, bone loss is accompanied by increased marrow adiposity. Given their proximity in the bone marrow and their shared origin, a dialogue between adipocytes and osteoblasts could be a factor in the competition between human Mesenchymal Stem Cells (hMSC) differentiation routes, leading to adipocyte differentiation at the expense of osteoblast differentiation. The adipocyte/osteoblast balance is highly regulated at the level of gene transcription. In our work, we focused on PPARgamma, CEBPalpha and CEBPdelta, as these transcription factors are seen as master regulators of adipogenesis and expressed precociously, and on leptin and adiponectin, considered as adipocyte marker genes. In 2010, our group has demonstrated, thanks to a coculture model, that in the presence of hMSC-derived adipocytes (hMSC-Adi), hMSC-derived osteoblasts (hMSC-Ost) express lesser amounts of osteogenic markers but exhibit the expression of typical adipogenic genes. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying this modulation of gene expression are not clarified. Recently, adipocytes were described as releasing extracellular vesicles (EVs), containing and transferring adipocyte specific transcripts, like PPARgamma, leptin and adiponectin. Here, we investigated whether EVs could be the way in which adipocytes transfer adipogenic RNAs in our coculture model. We observed in hMSC-Ost incubated in hAdi-CM an increase in the adipogenic PPAR&#x3b3;, leptin, CEBP&#x3b1; and CEBP&#x3b4; transcripts as well as the anti-osteoblastic miR-138, miR30c, miR125a, miR-125b, miR-31 miRNAs, probably implicated in the observed osteocalcin (OC) and osteopontin (OP) expression decrease. Moreover, EVs were isolated from conditioned media collected from cultures of hMSC at different stages of adipocyte differentiation and these specific adipogenic transcripts were detected inside. Finally, thanks to interspecies conditioned media exposition, we could highlight for the first time a horizontal transfer of adipogenic transcripts from medullary adipocytes to osteoblasts. Here, we have shown, for the first time, RNA transfer between hMSC-derived adipocytes and osteoblasts through EVs. Additional studies are needed to clarify if this mechanism has a role in the adipocytic switch driven on osteoblasts by adipocytes inside bone marrow and if EVs could be a target component to regulate the competition between osteoblasts and adipocytes in the prevention or in the therapy of osteoporosis and other osteopenia.",

    "abstract": "Obesity and related metabolic disorders, such as diabetes mellitus, raise the risk of liver carcinogenesis. Metformin, which is widely used in the treatment of diabetes, ameliorates insulin sensitivity. Metformin is also thought to have antineoplastic activities and to reduce cancer risk. The present study examined the preventive effect of metformin on the development of diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced liver tumorigenesis in C57BL/KsJ-+Leprdb/+Leprdb (db/db) obese and diabetic mice. The mice were given a single injection of DEN at 2 weeks of age and subsequently received drinking water containing metformin for 20 weeks. Metformin administration significantly reduced the multiplicity of hepatic premalignant lesions and inhibited liver cell neoplasms. Metformin also markedly decreased serum levels of insulin and reduced insulin resistance, and inhibited phosphorylation of Akt, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and p70S6 in the liver. Furthermore, serum levels of leptin were decreased, while those of adiponectin were increased by metformin. These findings suggest that metformin prevents liver tumorigenesis by ameliorating insulin sensitivity, inhibiting the activation of Akt/mTOR/p70S6 signaling, and improving adipokine imbalance. Therefore, metformin may be a potent candidate for chemoprevention of liver tumorigenesis in patients with obesity or diabetes.",

    "abstract": "The combinatorial peptidergic therapy of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) and leptin (LEP) analogues was once an optimistic option in treating obese animals and patients. However, the need for frequent administrations and its negative side effects prevent it from being a viable choice. Here, we developed a combinatorial gene therapy of IAPP and LEP, where two genes are inserted into a single plasmid with self-cleaving furin and 2A sites to treat diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. The developed plasmid DNA (pDNA) individually produced both IAPP and LEP peptides in vitro and in vivo. The pDNA was delivered with a non-viral polymeric carrier, and its once-a-week administrations demonstrated a synergistic loss of body weight and significant reductions of fat mass, blood glucose, and lipid levels in DIO mice. The results suggest that the combinatorial gene therapy would have higher potential than the peptidergic approach for future translation due to its improved practicability.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a risk factor for ischemic necrosis of the femoral head (INFH). The purpose of this study was to determine if leptin treatment of INFH stimulates new bone formation to preserve femoral head shape in rats with diet-induced obesity. Rats were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or normal chow diet (NCD) for 16 weeks to induce progressive development of obesity. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head (AVN) was surgically induced. Adenovirus-mediated introduction of the leptin gene was by intravenous injection 2 days before surgery-induced AVN. At 6 weeks post-surgery, radiologic and histomorphometric assessments were performed. Leptin signaling in tissues was examined by Western blot. Osteogenic markers were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. Radiographs showed better preservation of femoral head architecture in the HFD-AVN-Leptin group than the HFD-AVN and HFD-AVN-LacZ groups. Histology and immunohistochemistry revealed the HFD-AVN-Leptin group had significantly increased osteoblastic proliferation and vascularity in infarcted femoral heads compared with the HFD-AVN and HFD-AVN-LacZ groups. Intravenous injection of leptin enhanced serum VEGF levels and activated HIF-1&#x3b1; pathways. Runx 2 and its target genes were significantly upregulated in the HFD-AVN-Leptin group. These results indicate that leptin resistance is important in INFH pathogenesis. Leptin therapy could be a new strategy for INFH.",

    "abstract": "Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a metabolic hormone with pleiotropic effects on glucose and lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity. It acts as a key downstream target of both peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x3b1; and &#x3b3;, the agonists of which have been used for lipid lowering and insulin sensitization, respectively. However, the role of FGF21 in the cardiovascular system remains elusive. The roles of FGF21 in atherosclerosis were investigated by evaluating the impact of FGF21 deficiency and replenishment with recombinant FGF21 in apolipoprotein E(-/-) mice. FGF21 deficiency causes a marked exacerbation of atherosclerotic plaque formation and premature death in apolipoprotein E(-/-) mice, which is accompanied by hypoadiponectinemia and severe hypercholesterolemia. Replenishment of FGF21 protects against atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E(-/-)mice via 2 independent mechanisms, inducing the adipocyte production of adiponectin, which in turn acts on the blood vessels to inhibit neointima formation and macrophage inflammation, and suppressing the hepatic expression of the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2, thereby leading to reduced cholesterol synthesis and attenuation of hypercholesterolemia. Chronic treatment with adiponectin partially reverses atherosclerosis without obvious effects on hypercholesterolemia in FGF21-deficient apolipoprotein E(-/-) mice. By contrast, the cholesterol-lowering effects of FGF21 are abrogated by hepatic expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2. FGF21 protects against atherosclerosis via fine tuning the multiorgan crosstalk among liver, adipose tissue, and blood vessels.",

    "title": "Obesity-induced hypertension: interaction of neurohumoral and renal mechanisms.",
    "abstract": "Excess weight gain, especially when associated with increased visceral adiposity, is a major cause of hypertension, accounting for 65% to 75% of the risk for human primary (essential) hypertension. Increased renal tubular sodium reabsorption impairs pressure natriuresis and plays an important role in initiating obesity hypertension. The mediators of abnormal kidney function and increased blood pressure during development of obesity hypertension include (1) physical compression of the kidneys by fat in and around the kidneys, (2) activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and (3) increased sympathetic nervous system activity. Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is likely due, in part, to renal compression, as well as sympathetic nervous system activation. However, obesity also causes mineralocorticoid receptor activation independent of aldosterone or angiotensin II. The mechanisms for sympathetic nervous system activation in obesity have not been fully elucidated but may require leptin and activation of the brain melanocortin system. With prolonged obesity and development of target organ injury, especially renal injury, obesity-associated hypertension becomes more difficult to control, often requiring multiple antihypertensive drugs and treatment of other risk factors, including dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus, and inflammation. Unless effective antiobesity drugs are developed, the effect of obesity on hypertension and related cardiovascular, renal and metabolic disorders is likely to become even more important in the future as the prevalence of obesity continues to increase.",

    "abstract": "Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are a population of multipotent progenitors that have the capacity of proliferation and differentiation into mesenchymal lineage cells. The regulatory peptide apelin is the endogenous ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor APJ. Apelin, which can enhance BMSC proliferation, has mitogenic effects on a wide variety of cell types. We hypothesized that the increased apelin/APJ might be involved in the occurrence and development of hypoxia-induced BMSC proliferation. BMSCs from the bone marrow of 8- to 10-week-old C57BL/6J mice were cultured under either normoxia (21% oxygen) or hypoxia (1% oxygen) condition. Cell proliferation was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine assay. Expressions of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1&#x3b1;, apelin, APJ, Beclin-1, and LC3II/LC3I were detected by western blot analysis. Results suggested that hypoxia enhanced the proliferation of BMSC in a time-dependent manner. The expressions of HIF-1&#x3b1;, apelin, APJ, Beclin-1, and LC3II/LC3I were increased in BMSCs induced by hypoxia. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-HIF-1&#x3b1; that inhibited the hypoxia-induced expressions of apelin, APJ, Beclin-1, and LC3II/LC3I prevented hypoxia-induced BMSC proliferation. siRNA-APJ that inhibited the hypoxia-induced expressions of Beclin-1 and LC3II/LC3I reversed hypoxia-induced BMSC proliferation. siRNA-Beclin-1 also abolished hypoxia-induced cell proliferation. These data suggested that the apelin/APJ/autophagy signaling pathway might be involved in hypoxia-induced BMSC proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Leptin is a hormone with a key role in food intake and body weight homeostasis. Congenital leptin deficiency (CLD) is a rare disease that causes hyperphagia and early severe obesity. However, common obesity conditions are associated with hyperleptinemia and leptin resistance. The main signaling pathways activated by leptin as well as the mechanisms underlying the regulatory actions of leptin on food intake and on lipid and glucose metabolism are reviewed. The potential mechanisms involving leptin resistance and the main regulatory hormonal and nutritional factors controlling leptin production/functions are also analyzed. The pathophysiology of leptin in human obesity, and especially the trials analyzing effects of leptin replacement therapy in patients with CLD or in subjects with common obesity and in post-obese weight-reduced subjects are also summarized. The use of drugs or specific bioactive food components with anti-inflammatory properties to reduce the inflammatory state associated with obesity, especially at the hypothalamus, may help to overcome leptin resistance. Research should also be focused on investigating dietary strategies, food supplements or drugs capable of avoiding or reversing the leptin fall during weight management, in order to promote sustained body weight lowering and weight loss maintenance.",

    "abstract": "For the combined delivery of an insulin-sensitizing adipokine; i.e., the ADN gene, and the potent PPAR&#x3b3; agonist rosiglitazone, cationic lipid emulsions were formulated using the cationic lipid DOTAP, helper lipid DOPE, castor oil, Tween 20 and Tween 80. The effect of drug loading on the physicochemical characteristics of the cationic emulsion/DNA complexes was investigated. Complex formation between the cationic emulsion and negatively charged plasmid DNA was confirmed and protection from DNase was observed. The in vitro transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity were evaluated in HepG2 cells. The particle sizes of the cationic emulsion/DNA complex were in the range 230-540 nm and those of the rosiglitazone-loaded cationic emulsion/DNA complex were in the range 220-340 nm. Gel retardation of the complexes was observed when the complexation weight ratios of the cationic lipid to plasmid DNA exceeded 4:1 for both the drug-free and rosiglitazone-loaded complexes. Both complexes stabilized plasmid DNA against DNase. The ADN expression level increased dose-dependently when cells were transfected with the cationic emulsion/DNA complexes. The rosiglitazone-loaded cationic emulsion/DNA complexes showed higher cellular uptake in HepG2 cells depending on the rosiglitazone loading, but not depending on the type of plasmid DNA type such as pVAX/ADN, pCAG/ADN, or pVAX. The drug-loaded cationic emulsion/plasmid DNA complexes were less cytotoxic than free rosiglitazone. Therefore, a cationic emulsion could potentially serve as a co-delivery system for rosiglitazone and the adiponectin gene.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the antidiabetic effects of a hot water extract of edible Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat. (HW-ECM) were investigated in type 2 diabetic mice. HW-ECM improved blood glucose levels and insulin resistance and increased adiponectin mRNA expression in adipose tissues and protein concentrations in the plasma. Moreover, it increased adipose mRNA and protein expressions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x3b3; (PPAR&#x3b3;), a regulator of adiponectin transcription, and mRNA expression of its downstream target genes. It also reduced the adipose cell size and attenuated the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory adipocytokines in adipose tissues. These data presumably indicate a hypoglycemic mechanism of HW-ECM, involving increased PPAR&#x3b3; expression, decreased the adipocyte sizes, and suppression of chronic inflammation in adipose tissues. Finally, elevated adiponectin levels lead to amelioration of insulin resistance and the corresponding hypoglycemic effects. Therefore, HW-ECM indicates its potential as a functional food for type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the response of serum fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) to a meal and to insulin infusion in haemodialysis (HD) patients. Meal study: in a crossover design, 12 nondiabetic HD patients were randomly assigned to: (1) a non-HD day with one meal served, (2) a HD day with one meal served during HD and (3) a HD day with two meals served during and after HD, respectively. Twelve healthy controls participated in an experiment identical to the non-HD day. Insulin infusion study: in a crossover design, 11 nondiabetic HD patients were randomly assigned to receive a 4-h HD session with either: (1) no infusion, (2) glucose infusion or (3) glucose-insulin infusion. A meal was served 2&#xa0;h before HD start. Meal study: serum FGF21 was 23-fold higher in HD patients than controls (P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0&#xb7;001). Postprandial FGF21 decreased on all four study days (P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0&#xb7;006), but the relative reductions from baseline were significantly greater in controls (P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0&#xb7;008). Postprandial changes in FGF21 were inversely related with triglycerides (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0&#xb7;042) and positively related with insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) (P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0&#xb7;001). Serum FGF21 was only associated with changes in adiponectin (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0&#xb7;001) and free fatty acids (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0&#xb7;04) in the healthy controls. Insulin infusion study: as compared with no infusion, glucose and glucose-insulin infusion prevented the postprandial decrease in FGF21 and resulted in higher FGF21 concentrations by up to 25% (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0&#xb7;003). Serum FGF21 was highly elevated in HD patients but the response of serum FGF21 to meal intake and insulin infusion seemed to be intact. Our results indicate that FGF21 may play an important role in short-term metabolic homoeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Host nutrition can affect the outcome of parasitic diseases through metabolic effects on host immunity and/or the parasite. Here we show that modulation of mouse immunometabolism through brief restriction of food intake (dietary restriction, DR) prevents neuropathology in experimental cerebral malaria (ECM). While no effects are detected on parasite growth, DR reduces parasite accumulation in peripheral tissues including the brain, and increases clearance in the spleen. Leptin, a host-derived adipokine linking appetite, energy balance and immune function, is required for ECM pathology and its levels are reduced upon DR. Recombinant leptin abrogates DR benefits, while pharmacological or genetic inhibition of leptin signalling protects against ECM. DR reduces mTORC1 activity in T cells, and this effect is abrogated upon leptin administration. Furthermore, mTORC1 inhibition with rapamycin prevents ECM pathology. Our results suggest that leptin and mTORC1 provide a novel mechanistic link between nutrition, immunometabolism and ECM pathology, with potential therapeutic implications for cerebral malaria.",

    "abstract": "Rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, has been shown to increase mammalian life span; less is known concerning its effect on healthspan. The primary aim of this study was to examine rapamycin's role in the alteration of several physiological and behavioral outcomes compared with the healthspan-inducing effects of intermittent feeding (IF), another life-span-enhancing intervention. Male Fisher 344 &#xd7; Brown Norway rats (6 and 25 months of age) were treated with rapamycin or IF for 5 weeks. IF and rapamycin reduced food consumption and body weight. Rapamycin increased relative lean mass and decreased fat mass. IF failed to alter fat mass but lowered relative lean mass. Behaviorally, rapamycin resulted in high activity levels in old animals, IF increased levels of anxiety for both ages, and grip strength was not significantly altered by either treatment. Rapamycin, not IF, decreased circulating leptin in older animals to the level of young animals. Glucose levels were unchanged with age or treatment. Hypothalamic AMPK and pAMPK levels decreased in both older treated groups. This pattern of results suggests that rapamycin has more selective and healthspan-inducing effects when initiated late in life.",

    "abstract": "This investigation examines whether a low intermittent dose of rapamycin will avoid the hyperlipidemia and diabetes-like syndrome associated with rapamycin while still decreasing body weight and adiposity in aged obese rats. Furthermore, we examined if the rapamycin-mediated decrease in serum leptin was a reflection of decreased adiposity, diminished leptin synthesis, or both. To these ends, rapamycin (1mg/kg) was administered three times a week to 3 and 24-month old rats. Body weight, food intake, body composition, mTORC1 signaling, markers of metabolism, as well as serum leptin levels and leptin synthesis in adipose tissue were examined and compared to that following a central infusion of rapamycin. Our data suggest that the dosing schedule of rapamycin acts on peripheral targets to inhibit mTORC1 signaling, preferentially reducing adiposity and sparing lean mass in an aged model of obesity resulting in favorable outcomes on blood triglycerides, increasing lean/fat ratio, and normalizing elevated serum leptin with age. The initial mechanism underlying the rapamycin responses appears to have a peripheral action and not central. The peripheral rapamycin responses may communicate an excessive nutrients signal to the hypothalamus that triggers an anorexic response to reduce food consumption. This coupled with potential peripheral mechanism serves to decrease adiposity and synthesis of leptin.",

    "abstract": "Nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase/pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor/visfatin (Nampt/PBEF/visfatin) is an adipocytokine. By synthesizing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)), Nampt/PBEF/visfatin functions to maintain an energy supply that has critical roles in cell survival. Cerebral ischemia leads to energy depletion and eventually neuronal death by apoptosis in specific brain regions specially the hippocampus. However, the role of Nampt/PBEF/visfatin in brain and cerebral ischemia remains to be investigated. This study investigated the role of administration Nampt/PBEF/visfatin in hippocampal CA3 area using a transient global cerebral ischemia model. Both common carotid arteries were occluded for 20 min followed by reperfusion. Saline as a vehicle and Nampt/PBEF/visfatin at a dose of 100 ng were injected intracerebroventricularly (ICV) at the time of cerebral reperfusion. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of Nampt/PBEF/visfatin neuroprotection, levels of expression of apoptosis-related proteins (caspase-3 activation, Bax protein levels, and Bcl-2 protein levels) 96 h after ischemia were determined by immunohistochemical staining. The number of active caspase-3-positive neurons in CA3 was significantly increased in the ischemia group, compared with the sham group (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and treatment with Nampt/PBEF/visfatin significantly reduced the ischemia/reperfusion-induced caspase-3 activation, compared to the ischemia group (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Also, results indicated a significant increase in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in the ischemia group, compared with the sham group (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). However, treatment with Nampt/PBEF/visfatin significantly attenuated the ischemia/reperfusion-induced increase in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, compared with the ischemia group (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). This study has indicated that Nampt/PBEF/visfatin entails neuroprotective effects against ischemia injury when used at the time of cerebral reperfusion. These neuroprotective mechanisms of Nampt/PBEF/visfatin occur through decrease the expression ofproapoptotic proteins (cleaved caspase-3 and Bax) and, on the other hand, increase the expression ofantiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-2). Thus, our findings indicate that Nampt/PBEF/visfatin is a new therapeutic target for cerebral ischemia.",

    "title": "Adipocytokine, omentin inhibits doxorubicin-induced H9c2 cardiomyoblasts apoptosis through the inhibition of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species.",
    "abstract": "Omentin is a relatively novel adipocyte-derived cytokine mainly expressed in visceral adipose tissues. Blood omentin level decreases in the patients with obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis. We have previously demonstrated that omentin inhibits key pathological processes for hypertension development, including vascular inflammatory responses, contractile reactivity and structural remodeling. In addition, there are several reports demonstrating that omentin prevents cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial ischemic injury. Doxorubicin (DOX) is an effective anti-cancer drug with cardiotoxic side effect. Here we tested the hypothesis that omentin may prevent DOX-induced cardiac cytotoxicity. H9c2 rat cardiomyoblasts were treated with DOX in the absence or presence of omentin. Omentin (300 ng/ml, 3 h pretreatment) significantly inhibited DOX (1 &#x3bc;M, 18 h)-induced decreases in living cell number as determined by a colorimetric cell counting assay. Omentin (300 ng/ml, 3 h) significantly inhibited DOX (1 &#x3bc;M, 12 h)-induced cleaved caspase-3 expression as determined by Western blotting. Omentin (300 ng/ml, 3 h) significantly inhibited DOX (1 &#x3bc;M, 6 h)-induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production as determined by a MitoSOX Red fluorescent staining. In addition, a mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I inhibitor, rotenone (0.5 &#x3bc;M, 3 h pretreatment), significantly inhibited DOX (1 &#x3bc;M, 6-18 h)-induced decreases of living cell number, cleaved caspase-3 expression and mitochondrial ROS production. In summary, we for the first time demonstrate that omentin prevents DOX-induced H9c2 cells apoptosis through the inhibition of mitochondrial ROS production. These results indicate omentin as an attractive pharmaco-therapeautic target against DOX-induced cardiac side effect.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is recognized as a chronic low-grade inflammatory state due to adipose tissue expansion being accompanied by an increase in the production of proinflammatory adipokines. Our group is the first to report that B-cell-activating factor (BAFF) is produced from adipocytes and functions as a proinflammatory adipokine. Here, we investigated how loss of BAFF influenced diet-induced obesity in mice by challenging BAFF(-/-) mice with a high-fat diet for 10 weeks. The results demonstrated that weight gain in BAFF(-/-) mice was &gt;30% than in control mice, with a specific increase in the fat mass of the subcutaneous region rather than the abdominal region. Expression of lipogenic genes was examined by quantitative real-time PCR, and increased lipogenesis was observed in the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), whereas lipogenesis in the epididymal adipose tissue (EAT) was reduced. A significant decrease in EAT mass resulted in the downregulation of inflammatory gene expression in EAT, and more importantly, overall levels of inflammatory cytokines in the circulation were reduced in obese BAFF(-/-) mice. We also observed that the macrophages recruited in the enlarged SAT were predominantly M2 macrophages. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were cultured with adipose tissue conditioned media (ATCM), demonstrating that EAT ATCM from BAFF(-/-) mice contains antilipogenic and anti-inflammatory properties. Taken together, BAFF(-/-) improved systemic inflammation by redistributing adipose tissue into subcutaneous regions. Understanding the mechanisms by which BAFF regulates obesity in a tissue-specific manner would provide therapeutic opportunities to target obesity-related chronic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Mesenteric adipose tissue hypertrophy is unique to Crohn's disease while the molecular basis of the crosstalk between MAT and the intestinal inflammation is largely unknown. Telmisartan is an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker and a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-receptor-&#x3b3; agonist which has beneficial effects on fat distribution and pro-inflammatory adipokine expression. We evaluated the effect of telmisartan upon mesenteric adipose tissue alterations and inflammatory features in IL-10(-)/(-) mice. We found that treatment with telmisartan significantly ameliorated the severity of colitis in IL-10(-)/(-) mice. Additionally, administration of telmisartan was associated with restoration of mesenteric adipose tissue adipocyte morphology and the expression of adipokines. Furthermore, telmisartan treatment suppressed the neurotensin/microRNA-155 pathway in mesenteric adipose tissue from spontaneous colitis which was confirmed by an in vitro study using cultured mesenteric adipose tissue from Crohn's disease patients. Administration of telmisartan showed promising results in spontaneous colitis which was associated with the attenuated mesenteric adipose tissue alteration which at least in part, was associated with its activity in the regulation of the neurotensin/microRNA-155 pathway. These results support the hypothesis that regulating the abnormal immune response in adipose tissue is an important target for the treatment of Crohn's disease.",

    "abstract": "Resistant hypertension (RHTN) is a multifactorial and polygenic disease, frequently associated with obesity. Low plasma adiponectin levels, a hormone produced by the adipose tissue, were associated with RHTN. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) -11377C/G (rs266729) and +276G/T (rs1501299) in ADIPOQ (adiponectin gene) were associated with hypertension. This study evaluated the association between two SNPs (-11377C/G and +276G/T) and adiponectin levels in RHTN. This study comprised 109 patients with RHTN genotyped for both polymorphisms. A cross-sectional study was designed to compare features of CC homozygous versus G allele carriers for -11377C/G and GG homozygous versus T allele carriers for +276G/T. Office and ambulatory BP measurements were similar among genotypes subgroups in both SNPs as well as the markers of target organ damage (arterial stiffness, left ventricular mass index and microalbuminuria). Adiponectin concentrations were significantly higher in CC compared to G carrier for -11377C/G (CC:7.0 (4.0-10.2) versus G allele:5.5 (2.5-7.9), p = 0.04) and lower in GG compared to T carrier for +276G/T (GG:5.3 (2.3-7.7) versus T allele:7.1 (3.6-10.5), p = 0.04). Adjusting for systolic ambulatory BP, body mass index, age, gender, race and presence of type 2 diabetes, multiple linear regression analyses revealed that the minor alleles G (&#x3b2;-coefficient= -0.14, SE=0.07, p = 0.03) and T (&#x3b2;-coefficient=0.12, SE=0.06, p = 0.04) were independent predictors of adiponectin.

    "abstract": "The thiazolidinedione (TZDs) class of drugs are very effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). But due to the adverse effects of synthetic TZDs, their use is strictly regulated. The therapeutic actions of TZDs are mediated via modulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR&#x3b3;). Naturally occurring PPAR&#x3b3; modulators are more desirable as they lack the serious adverse effects caused by TZDs. This has prompted the exploitation of medicinal plants used in traditional medicine, for their potential PPAR&#x3b3; activity. In the present work, we studied chebulagic acid (CHA) isolated from fruits of Terminalia chebula with respect to its effect on adipogenesis, glucose transport, and endocrine function of adipocyte. The mRNA expression profile of PPAR&#x3b3; target gene CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBP-&#x3b1;) was analyzed by qRT-PCR. The putative binding mode and the potential ligand-target interactions of CHA, with PPAR&#x3b3; was analyzed using docking software (Autodock and iGEMDOCKv2). The results showed that CHA enhances PPAR&#x3b3; signaling and adipogenesis dose dependently but in a moderate way, less than rosiglitazone. GLUT4 expression and adiponectin secretion was increased by CHA treatment. The mRNA expression of PPAR&#x3b3; target gene C/EBP-&#x3b1; was increased in CHA -treated adipocytes. The comparison of results of various parameters of adipogenesis, insulin sensitivity, endocrine function and molecular docking experiments of roziglitazone and chebulagic acid indicate that the latter behaves like partial PPAR&#x3b3; agonist which could be exploited for phytoceutical development against T2DM.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin blocks hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression by inducing cell apoptosis through the modulation of C-Jun N-terminal kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin. However, the precise upstream signaling pathways or molecules remain elusive. In the present study, we analyzed the role of antioxidant protein thioredoxin (Trx) in adiponectin-induced apoptosis in HCC. Adiponectin treatment decreased the viabilities of both HepG2 and Huh7 HCC cells accompanied by increased accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species, as evidenced by 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate staining. Pretreatment of these cells with the deoxidant N-acetylcysteine blocked the inhibitory effect of adiponectin. Levels of Trx2 protein in both HCC cells were significantly decreased, and the level of Trx1 was significantly inhibited in Huh7 cells while unchanged in HepG2 cells. However, the redox state of Trx1 was altered from reduced to the oxidized form following adiponectin treatment in HepG2 cells. Overexpression of both Trx proteins rescued adiponectin-induced cell apoptosis, whereas mutated Trx proteins were less effective. Further analysis suggested that both ASK1 and JNK signaling are involved in this process. Trx1 and Trx2 proteins also manifested protective effects on HCC cells in response to adiponectin treatment in a xenograft tumor model. Furthermore, high levels of Trx proteins and low adiponectin expression levels were found in primary human HCC samples compared with paracancerous tissues. These results suggest that Trx proteins play important roles in mediating adiponectin-induced HCC cell apoptosis, thus providing new insights into the pathogenesis of HCC and identifying adiponectin and Trx proteins as potential combinational therapeutic targets for the treatment of HCC.",

    "title": "Role of leptin on the expression of low density lipoprotein receptor.",
    "abstract": "Leptin resistance oriented hyperleptinaemia is a common problem in obese subjects in association with hypercholesterolaemia. The most common target for hypercholesterolaemia is impaired low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). This study was carried out to investigate whether any alteration in LDLR expression could explain the occurrence of hypercholesterolaemia in the event of hyperleptinaemia. Expression of LDLR and SREBP2 (sterol regulatory element binding protein 2) were examined in HepG2 cells by RT-PCR and Western blotting. JAK2 inhibitor II was used to verify the effect of JAK-STAT (Janus Kinase-Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription) pathway (common mediator for cytokine signaling). Co-localization of LDLR and insulin receptor (IR) was examined by confocal microscopy. Leptin was found to reduce the expression of LDLR and its transcription factor SREBP2. On the other hand, a weak signal for stimulation of LDLR by leptin was noted to be mediated by JAK2 pathway. But the joint effect of the two signaling pathways kept LDLR only in depressed mode in presence of leptin. Confocal microscopy showed that LDLR made an intensively co-localized complex with insulin receptor in presence of leptin. Our results show that though leptin stimulates LDLR expression very weakly through JAK-STAT signaling pathway, it mainly imposes inhibition on LDLR expression by inhibiting transcription factor SREBP2. The inter-association between LDLR and IR may be a reason to render LDLR functionally inactive in presence of leptin.",

    "title": "Leptin signaling molecular actions and drug target in hepatocellular carcinoma.",
    "abstract": "Previous reports indicate that over 13 different tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), are related to obesity. Obesity-associated inflammatory, metabolic, and endocrine mediators, as well as the functioning of the gut microbiota, are suspected to contribute to tumorigenesis. In obese people, proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6, insulin and insulin-like growth factors, adipokines, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, adiponectin, and leptin are found to play crucial roles in the initiation and development of cancer. The cytokines induced by leptin in adipose tissue or tumor cells have been intensely studied. Leptin-induced signaling pathways are critical for biological functions such as adiposity, energy balance, endocrine function, immune reaction, and angiogenesis as well as oncogenesis. Leptin is an activator of cell proliferation and anti-apoptosis in several cell types, and an inducer of cancer stem cells; its critical roles in tumorigenesis are based on its oncogenic, mitogenic, proinflammatory, and pro-angiogenic actions. This review provides an update of the pathological effects of leptin signaling with special emphasis on potential molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targeting, which could potentially be used in future clinical settings. In addition, leptin-induced angiogenic ability and molecular mechanisms in HCC are discussed. The stringent binding affinity of leptin and its receptor Ob-R, as well as the highly upregulated expression of both leptin and Ob-R in cancer cells compared to normal cells, makes leptin an ideal drug target for the prevention and treatment of HCC, especially in obese patients.",

    "abstract": "The present study was designed to investigate the effect of leptin on estrogen metabolism in prostatic cells. Malignant (PC-3) and benign (BPH-1) human prostate cells were treated with 17-&#x3b2;-hydroxyestradiol (1 &#x3bc;M) alone or in combination with leptin (0.4, 4, 40 ng/ml) for 72 h. Cell proliferation assay, immunocytochemical staining of estrogen receptor (ER), liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method (LC-MS) and semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used. Cell proliferation assay demonstrated that leptin caused significant growth potentiation in both cells. Immunocytochemical staining showed that leptin significantly increased the expression of ER-&#x3b1; and decreased that of ER-&#x3b2; in PC-3 cells. LC-MS method revealed that leptin increased the concentration 4-hydroxyestrone and/or decreased that of 2-methoxyestradiol, 4-methoxyestradiol and 2-methoxyestrone. Interestingly, RT-PCR showed that leptin significantly up-regulated the expression of aromatase and cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) enzymes; however down-regulated the expression of catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme. These data indicate that leptin-induced proliferative effect in prostate cells might be partly attributed to estrogen metabolism. Thus, leptin might be a novel target for therapeutic intervention in prostatic disorders.",

PPAR&#x3b3; activators are known to have potent antihyperglycemic activity and are used to treat insulin resistance associated with diabetes. Therefore, many natural and synthetic agonists of PPAR&#x3b3; are used in the treatment of glucose disorders. In the present study, we found that 13-oxo-9(Z),11(E),15(Z)-octadecatrienoic acid (13-oxo-OTA), a linolenic acid derivative, is present in the extract of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), Mandarin orange (Citrus reticulata), and bitter gourd (Momordica charantia). We also found that 13-oxo-OTA activated PPAR&#x3b3; and induced the mRNA expression of PPAR&#x3b3; target genes in adipocytes, thereby promoting differentiation. Furthermore, 13-oxo-OTA induced secretion of adiponectin and stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report that 13-oxo-OTA induces adipogenesis through PPAR&#x3b3; activation and to present 13-oxo-OTA as a valuable food-derived compound that may be applied in the management of glucose metabolism disorders.",

    "abstract": "Hypoglycemia initiates the counter-regulatory response (CRR), in which the sympathetic nervous system, glucagon and glucocorticoids restore glucose to appropriate concentrations. During starvation, low leptin levels restrain energy utilization, enhancing long-term survival. To ensure short-term survival during hypoglycemia in fasted animals, the CRR must overcome this energy-sparing program and nutrient depletion. Here we identify in mice a previously unrecognized role for leptin and a population of leptin-regulated neurons that modulate the CRR to meet these challenges. Hypoglycemia activates neurons of the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) that coexpress leptin receptor (LepRb) and cholecystokinin (CCK) (PBN LepRb(CCK) neurons), which project to the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus. Leptin inhibits these cells, and Cck(cre)-mediated ablation of LepRb enhances the CRR. Inhibition of PBN LepRb cells blunts the CRR, whereas their activation mimics the CRR in a CCK-dependent manner. PBN LepRb(CCK) neurons are a crucial component of the CRR system and may be a therapeutic target in hypoglycemia.",

    "title": "MicroRNA-378 regulates adiponectin expression in adipose tissue: a new plausible mechanism.",
    "abstract": "Mechanisms regulating adiponectin expression have not been fully clarified. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression, are involved in biological processes, including obesity and insulin resistance. We evaluated whether the miRNA-378 pathway is involved in regulating adiponectin expression. First, we determined a putative target site for miRNA-378 in the 3 prime untranslated region (3'UTR) of the adiponectin gene by in silico analysis. The levels of adiponectin mRNA and protein were decreased in 3T3-L1 cells overexpressing the mimic of miRNA-378. Luminescence activity in HEK293T cells expressing a renilla-luciferase-adiponectin-3'UTR sequence was inhibited by overexpressing the mimic of miRNA-378, and the decrease was reversed by adding the inhibitor of miRNA-378. Moreover, we confirmed the inhibitory effects of the mimic were cancelled in a deleted mutant of the miR-378 3'-UTR binding site. Addition of tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1; (TNF&#x3b1;) led a upregulation of miR-378 and downregulation of adiponectin at mRNA and protein levels in 3T3-L1 cells. Level of miR-378 was higher and mRNA level of adiponectin was lower in diabetic ob/ob mice than those of normal C57BL/6 mice and levels of miR378 and adiponectin were negatively well correlated (r = -0.624, p = 0.004). We found that levels of miRNA-378 could modulate adiponectin expression via the 3'UTR sequence-binding site. Our findings warrant further investigations into the role of miRNAs in regulating the adiponectin expression.",

    "abstract": "Clinical prognosis is critically poor in fulminant myocarditis, while it's initiation or progression is fated, in part, by T cell-mediated autoimmunity. Adiponectin (APN) and associated adipokines were shown to be immune tolerance inducers, although the clinically relevant delivery method into target pathologies is under debate. Whether the cell sheet-based delivery system of adipokines might induce immune tolerance and functional recovery in experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) was tested. Scaffold-free-induced adipocyte cell-sheet (iACS) was generated by differentiating adipose tissue-derived syngeneic stromal vascular-fraction cells into adipocytes on temperature-responsive dishes. Rats with EAM underwent iACS implantation or sham operation. Supernatants of iACS contained a high level of APN and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and reduced proliferation of CD4-positive T cells in vitro. Immunohistolabelling showed that the iACS implantation elevated the levels of APN and HGF in the myocardium compared to the sham operation, which attenuated the immunological response by inhibiting CD68-positive macropharges and CD4-positive T-cells and activating Foxp3-positive regulatory T cells. Consequently, left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly greater after the iACS implantation than after the sham operation, in association with less collagen accumulation. The targeted delivery of adipokines using tissue-engineered iACS ameliorated cardiac performance of the EAM rat model via effector T cell suppression and induction of immune tolerance. These findings might suggest a potential of this tissue-engineered drug delivery system in treating fulminant myocarditis in the clinical setting.",

    "title": "Development of second generation peptides modulating cellular adiponectin receptor responses.",
    "abstract": "The adipose tissue participates in the regulation of energy homeostasis as an important endocrine organ that secretes a number of biologically active adipokines, including adiponectin. Recently we developed and characterized a first-in-class peptide-based adiponectin receptor agonist by using in vitro and in vivo models of glioblastoma and breast cancer (BC). In the current study, we further explored the effects of peptide ADP355 in additional cellular models and found that ADP355 inhibited chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell proliferation and renal myofibroblast differentiation with mid-nanomolar IC50 values. According to molecular modeling calculations, ADP355 was remarkably flexible in the global minimum with a turn present in the middle of the peptide. Considering these structural features of ADP355 and the fact that adiponectin normally circulates as multimeric complexes, we developed and tested the activity of a linear branched dimer (ADP399). The dimer exhibited approximately 20-fold improved cellular activity inhibiting K562 CML and MCF-7 cell growth with high pM-low nM relative IC50 values. Biodistribution studies suggested superior tissue dissemination of both peptides after subcutaneous administration relative to intraperitoneal inoculation. After screening of a 397-member adiponectin active site library, a novel octapeptide (ADP400) was designed that counteracted 10-1000 nM ADP355- and ADP399-mediated effects on CML and BC cell growth at nanomolar concentrations. ADP400 induced mitogenic effects in MCF-7 BC cells perhaps due to antagonizing endogenous adiponectin actions or acting as an inverse agonist. While the linear dimer agonist ADP399 meets pharmacological criteria of a contemporary peptide drug lead, the peptide showing antagonist activity (ADP400) at similar concentrations will be an important target validation tool to study adiponectin functions.",

    "abstract": "Omega (n)-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), namely docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), are known to reduce the risk of insulin resistance and ameliorate obesity-associated disorders. DHA and EPA structured in the phospholipid form possess superior biological effects compared to the triglyceride form available in fish oil. In this study, we have found that sea cucumber (SC) and blue mussel (BM) from Newfoundland and Labrador are rich sources of n-3 PUFA structured in the phospholipid form. Treatment with SC and BM methanolic extracts (250 and 100 &#x3bc;g mL(-1), respectively) significantly (p &lt; 0.01) increased triglyceride accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, along with an increase in the mRNA expression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#x3b3; (37 and 39%, respectively) and adiponectin (57 and 56%, respectively) compared with control cells (p &lt; 0.05). Only SC extracts (250 &#x3bc;g mL(-1)) increased the mRNA expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1). Treatment with higher concentrations of SC and BM extracts (500 and 750 &#x3bc;g mL(-1), respectively) significantly (p &lt; 0.01) decreased triglyceride accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells as opposed to an increase in triglyceride accumulation at lower concentrations. This was due to inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 and SREBP-1 mRNA expression compared to control cells (p &lt; 0.05). There was no effect of the extracts on the mRNA expression of hormone sensitive lipase or lipolysis, suggesting that the decrease in triglyceride accumulation at higher concentrations is not due to breakdown and release of fat. This is the first report to show that SC and BM are new sources of phospholipid bonded n-3 PUFA, with the potential to target insulin resistance and obesity.",

    "abstract": "TNF&#x3b1; is one of the initial and important mediators to activate downstream signaling pathways by binding to trimerized TNF&#x3b1; receptors (TNFR), and thus is an ideal drug target for cancer therapy. Taking advantage of intrinsic homotimerization of the globular domain of adiponectin (gAD), we have developed a novel TNF&#x3b1; antagonist, the trimerized fusion protein named sTNFRII-gAD. However, our previously-used CHO expression system yielded less than 10 mg/L of sTNFRII-gAD. To produce large quantities of sTNFRII-gAD efficiently, we used a modified CHO-S cell expression system, which is based on a pMH3 vector with non-coding GC-rich DNA fragments for high-level gene expression. We obtained stable clones that produced 75 mg/L of sTNFRII-gAD in the 96-well plate, adapted the clones to 40 ml suspension serum-free batch culture, then optimized the culturing conditions to scale up the fed-batch culture in a 3 L shake-flask and finally in a 5 L AP30 bioreactor. We achieved a final yield of 52 mg/L of sTNFRII-gAD. The trimerized sTNFRII-gAD exhibited the higher affinity to TNF&#x3b1; with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 5.63 nM than the dimerized sTNFRII-Fc with a Kd of 13.4 nM, and further displayed the higher TNF&#x3b1;-neutralizing activity than sTNFRII-Fc (p&lt;0.05) in a L929 cytotoxicity assay. Therefore, the strategy employed in this study may provide an efficient avenue for large-scale production of other recombinant proteins by use of the modified CHO-S cell expression system.",

    "abstract": "Sleep fragmentation (SF) is highly prevalent and may constitute an important contributing factor to excessive weight gain and the metabolic syndrome. Increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) leading to the attenuation of leptin receptor signaling in the hypothalamus leads to obesity and metabolic dysfunction. Mice were exposed to SF and sleep control (SC) for varying periods of time during which ingestive behaviors were monitored. UPR pathways and leptin receptor signaling were assessed in hypothalami. To further examine the mechanistic role of ER stress, changes in leptin receptor (ObR) signaling were also examined in wild-type mice treated with the ER chaperone tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), as well as in CHOP-/+ transgenic mice. Fragmented sleep in male mice induced increased food intake starting day 3 and thereafter, which was preceded by increases in ER stress and activation of all three UPR pathways in the hypothalamus. Although ObR expression was unchanged, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation was decreased, suggesting reduced ObR signaling. Unchanged suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) expression and increases in protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) expression and activity emerged with SF, along with reduced p-STAT3 responses to exogenous leptin. SF-induced effects were reversed following TUDCA treatment and were absent in CHOP -/+ mice. SF induces hyperphagic behaviors and reduced leptin signaling in hypothalamus that are mediated by activation of ER stress, and ultimately lead to increased PTP1B activity. ER stress pathways are therefore potentially implicated in SF-induced weight gain and metabolic dysfunction, and may represent a viable therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "In human and swine, leptin (OB) has been identified in seminal plasma and leptin receptors (OB-R) on the cell surface of spermatozoa, indicating that spermatozoa are a target for OB. This hormone has also been detected in follicular fluid (FF) in women and mares, although its role requires further study. The aims of this study were to investigate the immunolocalisation and the expression of OB and OB-R in equine spermatozoa and to evaluate the involvement of OB in equine in vitro fertilisation (IVF). Since progesterone (P) and OB are both found in FF, the individual and combined effects of these two hormones were studied in equine IVF and compared with the results obtained from the use of FF for in vitro sperm preparation. For the first time, we were able to identify OB and OB-R mRNA and their corresponding proteins in equine spermatozoa. When spermatozoa were treated with OB, there was a decrease in the three motility parameters VSL, STR and LIN, commonly associated with hyperactivation, whilst the acrosome reaction rate increased (P&lt;0.05). The fertilisation rate was 51% with FF, 46.15% with P, 43.64% with P+OB and 0% with OB alone. The percentage of eight-cell stage embryos was 18.7% with FF, 17.1% with P and 16.7% with OB+P. OB alone did not permit oocyte fertilisation, indicating that, in the horse, OB is involved in capacitation and hyperactivation but not in sperm penetration.",

    "abstract": "After nerve injury, adult sensory neurons can regenerate peripheral axons and reconnect with their target tissue. Initiation of outgrowth, as well as elongation of neurites over long distances, depends on the signaling of receptors for neurotrophic growth factors. Here, we investigated the importance of gp130, the signaling subunit of neuropoietic cytokine receptors in peripheral nerve regeneration. After sciatic nerve crush, functional recovery in vivo was retarded in SNS-gp130(-/-) mice, which specifically lack gp130 in sensory neurons. Correspondingly, a significantly reduced number of free nerve endings was detected in glabrous skin from SNS-gp130(-/-) compared with control mice after nerve crush. Neurite outgrowth and STAT3 activation in vitro were severely reduced in cultures in gp130-deficient cultured neurons. Surprisingly, in neurons obtained from SNS-gp130(-/-) mice the increase in neurite length was reduced not only in response to neuropoietic cytokine ligands of gp130 but also to nerve growth factor (NGF), which does not bind to gp130-containing receptors. Neurite outgrowth in the absence of neurotrophic factors was partially rescued in gp130-deficient neurons by leptin, which activates STAT3 downstream of leptic receptor and independent of gp130. The neurite outgrowth response of gp130-deficient neurons to NGF was fully restored in the presence of leptin. Based on these findings, gp130 signaling via STAT3 activation is suggested not only to be an important regulator of peripheral nerve regeneration in vitro and in vivo, but as determining factor for the growth promoting action of NGF in adult sensory neurons.",

    "title": "The herbal composition GGEx18 from Laminaria japonica, Rheum palmatum, and Ephedra sinica inhibits visceral obesity and insulin resistance by upregulating visceral adipose genes involved in fatty acid oxidation.",
    "abstract": "The herbal composition Gyeongshingangjeehwan 18 (GGEx18) extracted from Rheum palmatum L. (Polygonaceae), Laminaria japonica Aresch (Laminariaceae), and Ephedra sinica Stapf (Ephedraceae) is traditionally used as an anti-obesity drug by local clinics in Korea. This study investigates the effects of GGEx18 on visceral obesity and insulin resistance and determines the molecular mechanisms involved in this process. After C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with GGEx18 (125, 250, and 500&#x2009;mg/kg) for 8 weeks and 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with GGEx18 (0.1, 1, and 10&#x2009;&#x3bc;g/ml); variables and determinants of visceral obesity and insulin resistance were measured using in vivo and in vitro approaches. Administration of GGEx18 to obese mice decreased visceral adipose tissue weight with an ED50 value of 232&#x2009;mg/kg. 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with GGEx18 showed a reduction in lipid accumulation with an ED50 value of 0.7&#x2009;&#xb5;g/ml. GGEx18 significantly increased the expression of fatty acid oxidation genes, including adiponectin, AMPKs, PPAR&#x3b1; and its target enzymes, and CPT-1, in both mesenteric adipose tissues and 3T3-L1 cells. However, GGEx18 treatment decreased the mRNA levels of adipocyte marker genes such as PPAR&#x3b3;, aP2, TNF&#x3b1;, and leptin. GGEx18 normalized hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in obese mice. Blood glucose levels of GGEx18-treated mice were significantly reduced during oral glucose tolerance tests compared with obese controls. These results suggest that GGEx18 may treat visceral obesity and visceral obesity-related insulin resistance by upregulating the visceral adipose expression of fatty acid oxidative genes.",

    "abstract": "Long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFA) in the diet protect against insulin resistance and obesity. Fibroblast growth factor-21 (Fgf21) is a hormonal factor released mainly by the liver that has powerful anti-diabetic effects. Here, we tested whether the beneficial metabolic effects of LC n-3 PUFA involve the induction of Fgf21. C57BL/6 J mice were exposed to an obesogenic, corn-oil-based, high-fat diet (cHF), or a diet in which corn oil was replaced with a fish-derived LC n-3 PUFA concentrate (cHF + F) using two experimental settings: short-term (3 weeks) and long-term treatment (8 weeks). CHF + F reduced body weight gain, insulinemia, and triglyceridemia compared to cHF. cHF increased plasma Fgf21 levels and hepatic Fgf21 gene expression compared with controls, but these effects were less pronounced or absent in cHF + F-fed mice. In contrast, hepatic expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-&#x3b1; target genes were more strongly induced by cHF + F than cHF, especially in the short-term treatment setting. The expression of genes encoding Fgf21, its receptors, and Fgf21 targets was unaltered by short-term LC n-3 PUFA treatment, with the exception of Ucp1 (uncoupling protein 1) and adiponectin genes, which were specifically up-regulated in white fat. In the long-term treatment setting, the expression of Fgf21 target genes and receptors was not differentially affected by LC n-3 PUFA. Collectively, our findings indicate that increased Fgf21 levels do not appear to be a major mechanism through which LC n-3 PUFA ameliorates high-fat-diet-associated metabolic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory response and articular destruction are common symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Leptin, an adipocyte-secreted hormone that centrally regulates weight control, may exert proinflammatory effects in the joint, depending on the immune response. Yet, the mechanism of leptin interacting with the arthritic inflammatory response is unclear. This study finds that leptin increased expression of oncostatin M (OSM) in human osteoblasts in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. In addition, OBRl, but not OBRs receptor antisense oligonucleotide, abolished the leptin-mediated increase of OSM expression. On the other hand, leptin inhibited miR-93 expression; an miR-93 mimic reversed leptin-increased OSM expression. Stimulation of osteoblasts with leptin promoted Akt phosphorylation, while pretreatment of cells with Akt inhibitor or siRNA reversed leptin-inhibited miR-93 expression. Our results showed that leptin heightened OSM expression by downregulating miR-93 through the Akt signaling pathway in osteoblasts, suggesting leptin as a novel target in arthritis treatment.",

The mechanisms of obesity-related hypertension include, among others, aldosterone excess and inflammatory adipokines, which have demonstrated a significant role in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome and RH. This review aims to summarize recent studies on the role of the adipokines leptin, resistin, and adiponectin in the pathophysiology of RH and target-organ damage associated with this condition. The deregulation of adipokine levels has been associated with clinical characteristics frequently recognized in RH such as diabetes, hyperactivity of sympathetic and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems, and vascular and renal damage. Strategies to regulate adipokines may be promising for the management of RH and some clinical implications must be considered when managing controlled and uncontrolled patients with RH.",

Here we show that IL-1 family member IL-37, recently characterized as an anti-inflammatory cytokine, ameliorates obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance. Mice transgenic for human IL-37 (IL-37tg) exhibit reduced numbers of adipose tissue macrophages, increased circulating levels of adiponectin and preserved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity after 16 weeks of HFD. In vitro treatment of adipocytes with recombinant IL-37 reduces adipogenesis and activates AMPK signalling. In humans, elevated steady-state IL-37 adipose tissue mRNA levels are positively correlated with insulin sensitivity and a lower inflammatory status of the adipose tissue. These findings reveal IL-37 as an important anti-inflammatory modulator during obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance in both mice and humans, and suggest that IL-37 is a potential target for the treatment of obesity-induced insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is an emerging potential therapeutic target for metabolic syndrome due to its role in synthesis, secretion, and folding of proteins. It leads to an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which, along with mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced antioxidant defense, causes chronic cell injury. The present investigation aims to observe the alterations in adipocytes due to ER stress and the protective effect of hydroxycitric acid (HCA), a bioactive from Garcinia species, to develop the same as a nutraceutical. ER stress was induced in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes by treating them with tunicamycin (2&#x3bc;g/ml) for 18 h. Alterations in cell viability, innate antioxidant system (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase), mitochondria (membrane potential, biogenesis, and transition pore opening), and inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor, monocyte chemoattractant protein, interferon-&#x3b3;, interleukin (IL)-10, IL-6, and IL-1&#x3b2;) during ER stress, and co-treatment with HCA were analyzed. Endocrine function of adipocytes was also assessed by measuring adiponectin and leptin secretion levels. HCA protected the cells from ER stress by improving the antioxidant status and mitochondrial functions. The results validate nutraceutical properties of the edible bioactive, commonly used for culinary purpose. A more detailed study on the mechanism of action of HCA is required for developing it as a therapeutic agent for metabolic syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Evidence from the literature suggests diminished acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) treatment efficacy in type 2 diabetes (DM2). High on-aspirin platelet reactivity (HAPR) in DM2 has been linked to poor glycemic and lipid control. However, there are no consistent data on the association between HAPR and insulin resistance or adipose tissue metabolic activity. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between laboratory response to ASA and metabolic control, insulin resistance and adipokines in DM2. A total of 186 DM2 patients treated with oral antidiabetic drugs and receiving 75 mg ASA daily were included in the analysis. Response to ASA was assessed by measuring serum thromboxane B2 (TXB2) concentration and expressed as quartiles of TXB2 level. The achievement of treatment targets in terms of glycemic and lipid control, insulin resistance parameters (including Homeostatic Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance, HOMA-IR, index), and serum concentrations of high-molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin, leptin and resistin, were evaluated in all patients. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the predictive factors of serum TXB2 concentration above the upper quartile and above the median. Significant trends in age, body mass index (BMI), HOMA-IR, HMW adiponectin concentration, C-reactive protein concentration and the frequency of achieving target triglyceride levels were observed across increasing quartiles of TXB2. In a multivariate analysis, only younger age and higher BMI were independent predictors of TXB2 concentration above the upper quartile, while younger age and lower HMW adiponectin concentration were predictors of TXB2 concentration above the median. These results suggest that in DM2, the most important predictor of HAPR is younger age. Younger DM2 patients may therefore require total daily ASA doses higher than 75 mg, preferably as a twice-daily regimen, to achieve full therapeutic effect. Higher BMI and lower HMW adiponectin concentration were also associated with less potent ASA effect. This is the first study to demonstrate an association of lower adiponectin concentration with higher serum TXB2 level in patients treated with ASA.",

    "title": "Is bisphenol S a safe substitute for bisphenol A in terms of metabolic function? An in vitro study.",
    "abstract": "As bisphenol A (BPA) has been shown to induce adverse effects on human health, especially through the activation of endocrine pathways, it is about to be withdrawn from the European market and replaced by analogues such as bisphenol S (BPS). However, toxicological data on BPS is scarce, and so it is necessary to evaluate the possible effects of this compound on human health. We compared the effect of BPA and BPS on obesity and hepatic steatosis processes using low doses in the same range as those found in the environment. Two in vitro models were used, the adipose cell line 3T3-L1 and HepG2 cells, representative of hepatic functions. We analyzed different parameters such as lipid and glucose uptakes, lipolysis, leptin production and the modulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism and energy balance. BPA and BPS induced an increase in the lipid content in the 3T3-L1 cell line and more moderately in the hepatic cells. We also observed a decrease in lipolysis after bisphenol treatment of adipocytes, but only BPS was involved in the increase in glucose uptake and leptin production. These latter effects could be linked to the modulation of SREBP-1c, PPAR&#x3b3;, aP2 and ERR&#x3b1; and &#x3b3; genes after exposure to BPA, whereas BPS seems to target the PGC1&#x3b1; and the ERR&#x3b3; genes. The findings suggest that both BPA and BPS could be involved in obesity and steatosis processes, but through two different metabolic pathways.",

    "title": "Apigenin and quercetin ameliorate mitochondrial alterations by tunicamycin-induced ER stress in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.",
    "abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an important organelle with functions like protein synthesis, folding, and calcium homeostasis. ER stress, a condition that dramatically affects protein folding homeostasis in cells, has been associated with a number of metabolic disorders. Emerging clinical and preclinical evidence support the notion that pharmacological modulators of ER stress have therapeutic potential as a novel target for treating metabolic diseases. ER is in physical contact with mitochondria, and there is a strong cross talk between these organelles at functional level. The present investigation was aimed to check the mitochondrial alterations in adipocytes with tunicamycin-induced ER stress and modulation by apigenin and quercetin. For this, differentiated adipocytes were incubated with tunicamycin (2&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/ml) for 18&#xa0;h, and changes in mitochondrial membrane potential, biogenesis, reactive oxygen species production, and adiponectin secretion were seen. Tunicamycin-induced ER stress altered reactive oxygen species (ROS) (6.34-fold&#x2191;), membrane potential (4.1-fold&#x2191;), mitochondrial biogenesis (2.4-fold&#x2193;), and adiponectin secretion (3.5-fold&#x2193;). Apigenin and quercetin ameliorated alterations in mitochondria. From results, we conclude that ER stress significantly alters mitochondrial functions and both the bioactives significantly protected mitochondrial alterations during ER stressand reestablished adiponectin secretion.",

    "abstract": "Atrial hypertrophy and fibrosis are essential pathological features of atrial fibrillation. Recently, adiponectin has become a protein of interest due to its beneficial effects on cardiovascular diseases. However, the molecular mechanism of atrial structural remodeling and signaling pathways evoked by adiponectin remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the cardioprotective effect of globular adiponectin (gAcrp) on angiotensin II-induced atrial hypertrophy and fibrosis in neonatal Sprague-Dawley rat. To further investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the preventive effect of gAcrp, transfection of cells with siRNA was used to suppress the mRNA expression of adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) and its downstream adaptor protein APPL1. Non-silencing-Cy-3 labelled siRNA was used to determine transfection efficiency using fluorescence microscopy. The expression of atrial natriuretic peptide and procollagen type1 &#x3b1;-1, hypertrophy marker and fibrosis one, respectively, was detected by real-time PCR. Furthermore, the expression of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt was detected by western blotting. In addition, nuclear p65 translocation activity was analyzed by EMSA supershift assay. Our results showed that AdipoR1 and the adaptor protein APPL1 mediated the protective effects of gAcrp. In addition, the function of adiponectin and phosphorylation of AMPK were prominently diminished by inhibition of PI3K. Furthermore, nuclear factor-&#x3ba;B (NF-&#x3ba;B) transcription was diminished by the specific inhibition of AMPK. Taken together, AMPK pivotally interacts with NF-&#x3ba;B and PI3K, mediating the cardioprotective effect of adiponectin, and may serve as a therapeutic target for preventing atrial hypertrophy and fibrosis. Our present study suggests that gAcrp could ameliorate AngII-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in rat atrial cells, which is mediated by the activation of AMPK signaling pathways. APPL1 and AdipoR1 are the key factors involved in the downstream of gAcrp approach.",

    "abstract": "Compelling evidence supports the important role of the glutamatergic system in the pathophysiology of major depression and also as a target for rapid-acting antidepressants. However, the functional role of glutamate release/transmission in behavioral processes related to depression and antidepressant efficacy remains to be elucidated. In this study, glutamate release and behavioral responses to tail suspension, a procedure commonly used for inducing behavioral despair, were simultaneously monitored in real time. The onset of tail suspension stress evoked a rapid increase in glutamate release in hippocampal field CA3, which declined gradually after its offset. Blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors by intra-CA3 infusion of MK-801, a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, reversed behavioral despair. A subpopulation of granule neurons that innervated the CA3 region expressed leptin receptors and these cells were not activated by stress. Leptin treatment dampened tail suspension-evoked glutamate release in CA3. On the other hand, intra-CA3 infusion of NMDA blocked the antidepressant-like effect of leptin in reversing behavioral despair in both the tail suspension and forced swim tests, which involved activation of Akt signaling in DG. Taken together, these results suggest that the DG-CA3 glutamatergic pathway is critical for mediating behavioral despair and antidepressant-like responses to leptin.",

    "abstract": "In this report we show that the adipocytokine leptin directly modulates autophagy in human CD4(+)CD25(-) conventional (Tconv) T cells. In vitro treatment with recombinant human leptin determined an inhibition of autophagy during T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, and this phenomenon was dose- and time-dependent. The events were secondary to the activation of the mammalian-target of rapamycin (mTOR)-pathway induced by leptin, as testified by its reversion induced by mTOR inhibition with rapamycin. At molecular level these phenomena associated with Bcl-2 up-regulation and its interaction with Beclin-1, whose complex exerts a negative effect on autophagy. The impact of leptin on autophagy of Tconv cells was determined at biochemical level by western blotting and by flow cytometry; the interaction between BCL-2 and Beclin-1 by co-immunoprecipitation assays. Our results, suggest that in unconditioned, freshly-isolated human Tconv cells, autophagy and proliferation are controlled by leptin during TCR-engagement, and that both phenomena occur alternatively indicating a balance between these processes during immune activation.",

    "title": "Leptin inhibits amyloid &#x3b2;-protein fibrillogenesis by decreasing GM1 gangliosides on the neuronal cell surface through PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.",
    "abstract": "Leptin is a centrally acting hormone that controls metabolic pathways. Recent epidemiological studies suggest that plasma leptin is protective against Alzheimer's disease. However, the mechanism that underlies this effect remains uncertain. To investigate whether leptin inhibits the assembly of amyloid &#x3b2;-protein (A&#x3b2;) on the cell surface of neurons, we treated primary neurons with leptin. Leptin treatment decreased the GM1 ganglioside (GM1) levels in the detergent-resistant membrane microdomains (DRMs) of neurons. The increase in GM1 expression induced by leptin was inhibited after pre-treatment with inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (LY294002), Akt (triciribine) and the mammalian target of rapamycin (i.e. rapamycin), but not by an inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (PD98059). In addition, pre-treatment with these reagents blocked the induction of GM1 in DRMs by leptin. Furthermore, A&#x3b2; assembly on the cell surface of neurons was inhibited greatly after treatment with leptin. This reduction was markedly inhibited after pre-treatment with LY294002, triciribine, and rapamycin. These results suggest that leptin significantly inhibits A&#x3b2; assembly by decreasing GM1 expression in DRMs of the neuronal surface through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the function of leptin in AD brains. In this study, our aim was to determine whether leptin regulates the expression and localization of GM1 on the neuronal membrane and if it induces the formation of A&#x3b2; assembly on the cell surface of neurons. Our results suggest that leptin regulates the expression of GM1 in DRMs of the neuronal membranes. Moreover, leptin does not seem to facilitate fibrillogenesis of exogenously added soluble A&#x3b2; from the cell surface of neurons.",

    "abstract": "A variety of compounds will distribute into the brain when placed at the cribriform plate by intranasal (i.n.) administration. In this study, we investigated the ability of albumin, a protein that can act as a drug carrier but is excluded from brain by the blood-brain barrier, to distribute into the brain after i.n. administration. We labeled bovine serum albumin with [(125)I] ([(125)I]Alb) and studied its uptake into 11 brain regions and its entry into the blood from 5 minutes to 6 hours after i.n. administration. [(125)I]Alb was present throughout the brain at 5 minutes. Several regions showed distinct peaks in uptake that ranged from 5 minutes (parietal cortex) to 60 minutes (midbrain). About 2-4% of the i.n. [(125)I]Alb entered the bloodstream. The highest levels occurred in the olfactory bulb and striatum. Distribution was dose-dependent, with less taken up by whole brain, cortex, and blood at the higher dose of albumin. Uptake was selectively increased into the olfactory bulb and cortex by the fluid-phase stimulator PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate), but inhibitors to receptor-mediated transcytosis, caveolae, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase were without effect. Albumin altered the distribution of radioactive leptin given by i.n. administration, decreasing uptake into the blood and by the cerebellum and increasing uptake by the hypothalamus. We conclude that [(125)I]Alb administered i.n. reaches all parts of the brain through a dose-dependent mechanism that may involve fluid-phase transcytosis and, as illustrated by leptin, can affect the delivery of other substances to the brain after their i.n. administration.",

    "abstract": "Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent organic pollutants associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in epidemiologic studies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the hepatic effects of a PCB mixture, Aroclor 1260, whose composition mimics human bioaccumulation patterns, in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity (DIO). Male C57Bl/6J mice were fed control diet or 42% high fat diet (HFD) and exposed to Aroclor 1260 (20mg/kg or 200mg/kg in corn oil) for 12weeks. A glucose tolerance test was performed; plasma/tissues were obtained at necropsy for measurements of adipocytokine levels, histology, and gene expression. Aroclor 1260 exposure was associated with decreased body fat in HFD-fed mice but had no effect on blood glucose/lipid levels. Paradoxically, Aroclor 1260+HFD co-exposed mice demonstrated increased hepatic inflammatory foci at both doses while the degree of steatosis did not change. Serum cytokines, ALT levels and hepatic expression of IL-6 and TNF&#x3b1; were increased only at 20mg/kg, suggesting an inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine production at the 200mg/kg exposure. Aroclor 1260 induced hepatic expression of cytochrome P450s including Cyp3a11 (Pregnane-Xenobiotic Receptor target) and Cyp2b10 (constitutive androstane receptor target) but Cyp2b10 inducibility was diminished with HFD-feeding. Cyp1a2 (aryl hydrocarbon Receptor target) was induced only at 200mg/kg. In summary, Aroclor 1260 worsened hepatic and systemic inflammation in DIO. The results indicated a bimodal response of PCB-diet interactions in the context of inflammation which could potentially be explained by xenobiotic receptor activation. Thus, PCB exposure may be a relevant second hit in the transformation of steatosis to steatohepatitis.",

In addition, the relationship between methylphenidate-related weight loss in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients and these biomolecules were evaluated. Thirty ADHD patients receiving methylphenidate and 20 healthy controls were included. Leptin, ghrelin, adiponectin, and BDNF levels were measured at baseline and after two-month treatment in both groups. At baseline, leptin, ghrelin, adiponectin, and BDNF levels were similar in the ADHD and control groups. The most common adverse events occurring in the ADHD group after a 2-month treatment period included loss of appetite (70%) and weight loss (66.7%). A significant difference was found in body weight, BMI, and CGI scores of the ADHD patients after the treatment. While post-treatment ghrelin and adiponectin levels were significantly higher in the ADHD group, BDNF level was significantly lower. Post-treatment decrease in leptin levels was not significant. Leptin and BDNF were not associated with poor appetite and/or weight loss due to methylphenidate treatment. However, ghrelin and adiponectin might be biomolecules that play a role in underlying neurobiological mechanisms of methylphenidate-related appetite or weight loss.",

    "abstract": "Hydroxytyrosol (HT) is the most prominent phenolic component of olives, olive oil, and their by-products, e.g. olive mill waste water. As the link between HT consumption (via extra virgin olive oil intake) and better cardiovascular prognosis is being scientifically validated, HT is entering the market as a potentially useful supplement for cardiovascular disease prevention. One of the target organs in cardiometabolic prevention is the adipose tissue, where inflammation, oxidative stress, and secretion of adipocytokines contribute to cardiovascular risk. We explored the nutrigenomic effects of long-term supplementation with nutritionally-relevant doses of HT, i.e. 0.03 gm% - with specific reference to the adipose tissue and glutathione metabolism - and we explored underlying mechanisms in vitro. We show that HT modulates the antioxidant network in the adipose tissue, as mediated by glutathione (GSH) and associated enzymes. We also confirmed the GSH-modulating activities of HT in cultured adipocytes, where low, physiological HT concentrations were able to blunt the H2O2-induced GSH/GSSG alteration indicative of oxidative stress. In terms of surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease, we recorded significantly decreased circulating leptin concentrations in mice fed with HT as compared with controls. HT - in nutritionally relevant amounts - is able to positively modulate the glutathione-driven antioxidant enzymatic machinery in the adipose tissue. Because HT is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) and exhibits an excellent safety profile in vitro and in vivo, its future employment as adjunct treatment of metabolic syndrome can be envisioned, pending specific trials.",

    "title": "Regulation of insulin resistance and adiponectin signaling in adipose tissue by liver X receptor activation highlights a cross-talk with PPAR&#x3b3;.",
    "abstract": "Liver X receptors (LXRs) have been recognized as a promising therapeutic target for atherosclerosis; however, their role in insulin sensitivity is controversial. Adiponectin plays a unique role in maintaining insulin sensitivity. Currently, no systematic experiments elucidating the role of LXR activation in insulin function based on adiponectin signaling have been reported. Here, we investigated the role of LXR activation in insulin resistance based on adiponectin signaling, and possible mechanisms. C57BL/6 mice maintained on a regular chow received the LXR agonist, T0901317 (30 mg/kg.d) for 3 weeks by intraperitoneal injection, and differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with T0901317 or GW3965. T0901317 treatment induced significant insulin resistance in C57BL/6 mice. It decreased adiponectin gene transcription in epididymal fat, as well as serum adiponectin levels. Activity of AMPK, a key mediator of adiponectin signaling, was also decreased, resulting in decreased Glut-4 membrane translocation in epididymal fat. In contrast, adiponectin activity was not changed in the liver of T0901317 treated mice. In vitro, both T0901317 and GW3965 decreased adiponectin expression in adipocytes in a dose-dependent manner, an effect which was diminished by LXR&#x3b1; silencing. ChIP-qPCR studies demonstrated that T0901317 decreased the binding of PPAR&#x3b3; to the PPAR-responsive element (PPRE) of the adiponectin promoter in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, T0901317 exerted an antagonistic effect on the expression of adiponectin in adipocytes co-treated with 3 &#xb5;M Pioglitazone. In luciferase reporter gene assays, T0901317 dose-dependently inhibited PPRE-Luc activity in HEK293 cells co-transfected with LXR&#x3b1; and PPAR&#x3b3;. These results suggest that LXR activation induces insulin resistance with decreased adiponectin signaling in epididymal fat, probably due to negative regulation of PPAR&#x3b3; signaling. These findings indicate that the potential of LXR activation as a therapeutic target for atherosclerosis may be limited by the possibility of exacerbating insulin resistance-related disease.",

    "title": "Adiponectin: a manifold therapeutic target for metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and coronary disease?",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin is the most abundant peptide secreted by adipocytes, being a key component in the interrelationship between adiposity, insulin resistance and inflammation. Central obesity accompanied by insulin resistance is a key factor in the development of metabolic syndrome (MS) and future macrovascular complications. Moreover, the remarkable correlation between coronary artery disease (CAD) and alterations in glucose metabolism has raised the likelihood that atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) may share a common biological background. We summarize here the current knowledge about the influence of adiponectin on insulin sensitivity and endothelial function, discussing its forthcoming prospects and potential role as a therapeutic target for MS, T2DM, and cardiovascular disease. Adiponectin is present in the circulation as a dimer, trimer or protein complex of high molecular weight hexamers, &gt;400 kDa. AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 are its major receptors in vivo mediating the metabolic actions. Adiponectin stimulates phosphorylation and AMP (adenosin mono phosphate) kinase activation, exerting direct effects on vascular endothelium, diminishing the inflammatory response to mechanical injury and enhancing endothelium protection in cases of apolipoprotein E deficiency. Hypoadiponectinemia is consistently associated with obesity, MS, atherosclerosis, CAD, T2DM. Lifestyle correction helps to favorably modify plasma adiponectin levels. Low adiponectinemia in obese patients is raised via continued weight loss programs in both diabetic and nondiabetic individuals and is also accompanied by reductions in pro-inflammatory factors. Diet modifications, like intake of fish, omega-3 supplementation, adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern and coffee consumption also increase adiponectin levels. Antidiabetic and cardiovascular pharmacological agents, like glitazones, glimepiride, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are also able to improve adiponectin concentration. Fibric acid derivatives, like bezafibrate and fenofibrate, have been reported to enhance adiponectin levels as well. T-cadherin, a membrane-associated adiponectin-binding protein lacking intracellular domain seems to be a main mediator of the antiatherogenic adiponectin actions. The finding of novel pharmacologic agents proficient to improve adiponectin plasma levels should be target of exhaustive research. Interesting future approaches could be the development of adiponectin-targeted drugs chemically designed to induce the activaton of its receptors and/or postreceptor signaling pathways, or the development of specific adiponectin agonists.",

    "abstract": "Obesity increases the risk of cancer death among postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, but the direct evidence for the mechanisms is lacking. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate direct evidence for the mechanisms mediating this epidemiologic phenomenon. We analyzed transcriptomic profiles of pretreatment biopsies from a prospective cohort of 137 ER+ breast cancer patients. We generated transgenic (MMTV-TGF&#x3b1;;A (y) /a) and orthotopic/syngeneic (A (y) /a) obese mouse models to investigate the effect of obesity on tumorigenesis and tumor progression and to determine biological mechanisms using whole-genome transcriptome microarrays and protein analyses. We used a coculture system to examine the impact of adipocytes/adipokines on breast cancer cell proliferation. All statistical tests were two-sided. Functional transcriptomic analysis of patients revealed the association of obesity with 59 biological functional changes (P &lt; .05) linked to cancer hallmarks. Gene enrichment analysis revealed enrichment of AKT-target genes (P = .04) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition genes (P = .03) in patients. Our obese mouse models demonstrated activation of the AKT/mTOR pathway in obesity-accelerated mammary tumor growth (3.7- to 7.0-fold; P &lt; .001; n = 6-7 mice per group). Metformin or everolimus can suppress obesity-induced secretion of adipokines and breast tumor formation and growth (0.5-fold, P = .04; 0.3-fold, P &lt; .001, respectively; n = 6-8 mice per group). The coculture model revealed that adipocyte-secreted adipokines (eg, TIMP-1) regulate adipocyte-induced breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Metformin suppress adipocyte-induced cell proliferation and adipocyte-secreted adipokines in vitro. Adipokine secretion and AKT/mTOR activation play important roles in obesity-accelerated breast cancer aggressiveness in addition to hyperinsulinemia, estrogen signaling, and inflammation. Metformin and everolimus have potential for therapeutic interventions of ER+ breast cancer patients with obesity.",

    "title": "Oncogenic role and therapeutic target of leptin signaling in colorectal cancer.",
    "abstract": "Obesity is characterized by high secretion of several cytokines from adipose tissue and is a recognized risk factor for many cancers. Among these cytokines, leptin mainly produced by adipose tissue and cancer cells is the most studied adipokine. Leptin is an activator of cell proliferation, an antiapoptotic molecule and inducer of cancer stem cells in many cell types, and its critical roles in obesity-related tumorigenesis are based on its oncogenic, mitogenic, pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic actions. These leptin-induced signals and action are critical for their biological effects on energy balance, adiposity, endocrine systems, immunity, angiogenesis as well as oncogenesis. This review focuses on the up-to-date knowledge on the oncogenic role of leptin signaling, clinical significance and specific drug target development in colorectal cancer (CRC). Additionally, leptin-induced angiogenic ability and molecular mechanisms in CRC cells are discussed. Stringent binding affinity of leptin/Ob-R and overexpression of leptin/Ob-R and their targets in cancer cells make it a unique drug target for prevention and treatment of CRC, particularly in obesity colorectal patients.",

    "title": "Pierced Lasso Bundles are a new class of knot-like motifs.",
    "abstract": "A four-helix bundle is a well-characterized motif often used as a target for designed pharmaceutical therapeutics and nutritional supplements. Recently, we discovered a new structural complexity within this motif created by a disulphide bridge in the long-chain helical bundle cytokine leptin. When oxidized, leptin contains a disulphide bridge creating a covalent-loop through which part of the polypeptide chain is threaded (as seen in knotted proteins). We explored whether other proteins contain a similar intriguing knot-like structure as in leptin and discovered 11 structurally homologous proteins in the PDB. We call this new helical family class the Pierced Lasso Bundle (PLB) and the knot-like threaded structural motif a Pierced Lasso (PL). In the current study, we use structure-based simulation to investigate the threading/folding mechanisms for all the PLBs along with three unthreaded homologs as the covalent loop (or lasso) in leptin is important in folding dynamics and activity. We find that the presence of a small covalent loop leads to a mechanism where structural elements slipknot to thread through the covalent loop. Larger loops use a piercing mechanism where the free terminal plugs through the covalent loop. Remarkably, the position of the loop as well as its size influences the native state dynamics, which can impact receptor binding and biological activity. This previously unrecognized complexity of knot-like proteins within the helical bundle family comprises a completely new class within the knot family, and the hidden complexity we unraveled in the PLBs is expected to be found in other protein structures outside the four-helix bundles. The insights gained here provide critical new elements for future investigation of this emerging class of proteins, where function and the energetic landscape can be controlled by hidden topology, and should be take into account in ab initio predictions of newly identified protein targets.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by inadequate &#x3b2;-cell response to the progressive insulin resistance. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, endogenous, noncoding RNAs representing a class of powerful gene expression modulators. Previous population studies observed a modulation of circulating miRNAs in diabetic patients; however, few data are presently available on miRNA modulation in diabetic patients na&#xef;ve to pharmacological treatment as well as the effect of glycemic control on this. We aimed at studying circulating miRNA expression in diabetic patients na&#xef;ve to treatment and at investigating the influence on this of glycemic control. This was a case-control study. Eighteen treatment-na&#xef;ve diabetic patients with poor metabolic control and 12 control patients participated in the study. Wide miRNA expression profiling was performed, and the expression of miRNAs found to be dysregulated was then validated by quantitative RT-PCR. Finally, algorithm-identified putative miRNA targets were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA. In diabetic patients, microarray analysis showed that four miRNAs are increased, whereas 21 miRNAs are decreased. Quantitative RT-PCR validation confirmed the significant up-regulation of miR-326 (P = .004) and down-regulation of let-7a (P &lt; .001) and let-7f (P = .003). Notably, an inverse negative correlation was found between circulating miR-326 and its putative target adiponectin (p = -0.479, P = .009). After 12 months of antidiabetic treatment, quantitative RT-PCR data analysis showed that miR-326 levels were unaffected, whereas the levels of let-7a and let-7f were significantly increased. Treatment-na&#xef;ve, poorly controlled diabetic patients show a significant dysregulation of miRNAs involved in the regulation of the adiponectin pathway, a phenomenon that may be reversed, at least in part, by improved glycemic control.",

    "abstract": "Obesity and the related metabolic syndrome have emerged as major public health issues in modern society. miRNAs have been shown to play key roles in regulating obesity-related metabolic syndrome, and some miRNAs regulated by adiponectin were identified as novel targets for controlling adipose tissue inflammation. miR-378 is a candidate target that was shown to be involved in adipose differentiation, mitochondrial metabolism and systemic energy homeostasis. However, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms of miR-378 expression. To better understand the physiological role of miR-378 in obesity and metabolic syndrome, it is crucial that we understand the regulation of miR-378 gene expression in human adipocytes. In this study, we investigated the effects of adipokines and inflammatory cytokines on miR-378 expression using Real-time PCR and the potential regulatory mechanisms using luciferase reporter assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Results : We found that adipokines and cytokines upregulated miR-378 expression primarily through SREBP and C/EBP binding sites in the miR-378 promoter region. Our findings showed that adipokines induced miR-378 expression and revealed the most likely mechanism of adipokine-induced miR-378 dysregulation in human adipocytes. miRNAs have been shown to function in regulating obesity-related metabolic syndrome, and miR-378 may be a novel target for controlling adipose tissue inflammation. This study offers a theoretical basis for understanding systemic adipose tissue inflammation and may provide new strategies for clinical treatment.",

    "title": "Corn gluten hydrolysate and capsaicin have complimentary actions on body weight reduction and lipid-related genes in diet-induced obese rats.",
    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that a combination of corn gluten hydrolysate (CGH) and capsaicin may have an additive or synergistic effect on body weight reduction. For 13 weeks, male Sprague-Dawley rats were provided a diet to induce obesity. Afterward, the rats were randomly divided into 5 dietary groups: the normal control (n = 5), the high-fat control (n = 8), the high-fat diet (HFD) containing 35% CGH (n = 7), the HFD containing 0.02% capsaicin (HF-P) (n = 8), and the HFD containing both CGH and capsaicin (HF-CP) (n = 7) for an additional 4 weeks. Administration of CGH plus capsaicin, along with a HFD, led to significant decreases in body weight, fat mass, lipids in the liver, and plasma leptin as well as increases in plasma adiponectin. The pattern of gene expression was different in each target organ. In the liver, up-regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x3b1;, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1&#x3b1;, and acyl-coenzyme A oxidase was found in the HF-CP group. In contrast, down-regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x3b3; was found in both the HFD containing 35% CGH and HF-CP groups. In skeletal muscle, up-regulation of insulin receptor and uncoupling protein 3 was found in the HF-P group only, whereas up-regulation of the glucose transporter 4 gene was observed in both the HF-CP and HF-P groups. In adipose tissue, up-regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x3b3; and hormone-sensitive lipase was only found in the HF-CP group. In summary, this study suggests that CGH and capsaicin perform complementary actions on food intake, lipid metabolism, and insulin sensitivity by a coordinated control of energy metabolism in the liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle, thus exerting an additive effect on body weight reduction.",

    "abstract": "Failure of adipocytes to expand during periods of energy excess can result in undesirable metabolic consequences such as ectopic fat accumulation and insulin resistance. Blinded screening studies have indicated that Artemisia scoparia (SCO) extracts can enhance adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation in cultured adipocytes. The present study tested the hypothesis that SCO treatment modulates fat cell development and function in vitro and insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue in vivo. In vitro experiments utilized a Gal4-PPAR&#x3b3; ligand binding domain (LBD) fusion protein-luciferase reporter assay to examine PPAR&#x3b3; activation. To investigate the ability of SCO to modulate adipogenesis and mature fat cell function in 3T3-L1 cells, neutral lipid accumulation, gene expression, and protein secretion were measured by Oil Red O staining, qRT-PCR, and immunoblotting, respectively. For the in vivo experiments, diet-induced obese (DIO) C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or HFD containing 1% w/w SCO for four weeks. Body weight and composition, food intake, and fasting glucose and insulin levels were measured. Phospho-activation and expression of insulin-sensitizing proteins in epididymal adipose tissue (eWAT) were measured by immunoblotting. Ethanolic extracts of A. scoparia significantly activated the PPAR&#x3b3; LBD and enhanced lipid accumulation in differentiating 3T3-L1 cells. SCO increased the transcription of several PPAR&#x3b3; target genes in differentiating 3T3-L1 cells and rescued the negative effects of tumor necrosis factor &#x3b1; on production and secretion of adiponectin and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in fully differentiated fat cells. DIO mice treated with SCO had elevated adiponectin levels and increased phosphorylation of AMPK&#x3b1; in eWAT when compared to control mice. In SCO-treated mice, these changes were also associated with decreased fasting insulin and glucose levels. SCO has metabolically beneficial effects on adipocytes in vitro and adipose tissue in vivo, highlighting its potential as a metabolically favorable botanical supplement.",

    "title": "Pluronic modified leptin with increased systemic circulation, brain uptake and efficacy for treatment of obesity.",
    "abstract": "Modification of hydrophilic proteins with amphiphilic block copolymers capable of crossing cell membranes is a new strategy to improve protein delivery to the brain. Leptin, a candidate for the treatment of epidemic obesity, has failed in part because of impairment in its transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that develops with obesity. We posit that modification of leptin with poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(propylene oxide)-b-poly(ethylene oxide), Pluronic P85 (P85) might permit this protein to penetrate the BBB independently of its transporter, thereby overcoming peripheral leptin resistance. Here we report that peripherally administered leptin-P85 conjugates exhibit biological activity by reducing food intake in mouse models of obesity (ob/ob, and diet-induced obese mouse). We further generated two new leptin-P85 conjugates: one, Lep(ss)-P85(L), containing one P85 chain and another, Lep(ss)-P85(H), containing multiple P85 chains. We report data on their purification, analytical characterization, peripheral and brain pharmacokinetics (PK). Lep(ss)-P85(L) crosses the BBB using the leptin transporter, and exhibits improved peripheral PK along with increased accumulation in the brain compared to unmodified leptin. Lep(ss)-P85(H) also has improved peripheral PK but in a striking difference to the first conjugate penetrates the BBB independently of the leptin transporter via a non-saturable mechanism. The results demonstrate that leptin analogs can be developed through chemical modification of the native leptin with P85 to overcome leptin resistance at the level of the BBB, thus improving the potential for the treatment of obesity.",

    "title": "Circadian clock control of endocrine factors.",
    "abstract": "Organisms experience dramatic fluctuations in demands and stresses over the course of the day. In order to maintain biological processes within physiological boundaries, mechanisms have evolved for anticipation of, and adaptation to, these daily fluctuations. Endocrine factors have an integral role in homeostasis. Not only do circulating levels of various endocrine factors oscillate over the 24 h period, but so too does responsiveness of target tissues to these signals or stimuli. Emerging evidence suggests that these daily endocrine oscillations do not occur solely in response to behavioural fluctuations associated with sleep-wake and feeding-fasting cycles, but are orchestrated by an intrinsic timekeeping mechanism known as the circadian clock. Disruption of circadian clocks by genetic and/or environmental factors seems to precipitate numerous common disorders, including the metabolic syndrome and cancer. Collectively, these observations suggest that strategies designed to realign normal circadian rhythmicities hold potential for the treatment of various endocrine-related disorders.",

    "title": "Globular adiponectin inhibits ethanol-induced reactive oxygen species production through modulation of NADPH oxidase in macrophages: involvement of liver kinase B1/AMP-activated protein kinase pathway.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin, an adipokine predominantly secreted from adipocytes, has been shown to play protective roles against chronic alcohol consumption. Although excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in macrophages is considered one of the critical events for ethanol-induced damage in various target tissues, the effect of adiponectin on ethanol-induced ROS production is not clearly understood. In the present study, we investigated the effect of globular adiponectin (gAcrp) on ethanol-induced ROS production and the potential mechanisms underlying these effects of gAcrp in macrophages. Here we demonstrated that gAcrp prevented ethanol-induced ROS production in both RAW 264.7 macrophages and primary murine peritoneal macrophages. Globular adiponectin also inhibited ethanol-induced activation of NADPH oxidase. In addition, gAcrp suppressed ethanol-induced increase in the expression of NADPH oxidase subunits, including Nox2 and p22(phox), via modulation of nuclear factor-&#x3ba;B pathway. Furthermore, pretreatment with compound C, a selective inhibitor of AMPK, or knockdown of AMPK by small interfering RNA restored suppression of ethanol-induced ROS production and Nox2 expression by gAcrp. Finally, we found that gAcrp treatment induced phosphorylation of liver kinase B1 (LKB1), an upstream signaling molecule mediating AMPK activation. Knockdown of LKB1 restored gAcrp-suppressed Nox2 expression, suggesting that LKB1/AMPK pathway plays a critical role in the suppression of ethanol-induced ROS production and activation of NADPH oxidase by gAcrp. Taken together, these results demonstrate that globular adiponectin prevents ethanol-induced ROS production, at least in part, via modulation of NADPH oxidase in macrophages. Further, LKB1/AMPK axis plays an important role in the suppression of ethanol-induced NADPH oxidase activation by gAcrp in macrophages.",

    "title": "YKL-40 downregulation is a key factor to overcome temozolomide resistance in a glioblastoma cell line.",
    "abstract": "The frequent recurrence of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) after standard treatment with temozolomide (TMZ) is a crucial issue to be solved in the clinical field. O6&#x2011;methylguanine&#x2011;DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is considered one of the major mechanisms involved in TMZ resistance. However, some important mechanisms for TMZ resistance other than MGMT have recently been identified. In the present study, we established a TMZ-resistant (TMZ-R) U87 glioblastoma cell line in vitro and in vivo and investigated novel targeting molecules other than MGMT in those cells. The TMZ-R U87 glioblastoma cell line was established in vitro and in vivo. TMZ-R U87 cells showed a more invasive activity and a shorter survival time in vivo. Gene expression analysis using DNA microarray and quantitative PCR (qPCR) demonstrated that YKL&#x2011;40, MAGEC1 and MGMT mRNA expression was upregulated 100-, 83- and 6-fold, respectively in the TMZ-R U87 cell line. Western blot analysis and qPCR demonstrated that STAT3 phosphorylation, STAT3 target genes and stem cell and mesenchymal marker genes were upregulated to a greater extent in the TMZ&#x2011;resistant cell line. Notably, short hairpin (sh)RNA&#x2011;based inhibition against the YKL&#x2011;40 gene resulted in moderate growth inhibition in the resistant cells in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, YKL&#x2011;40 gene inhibition exhibited significant suppression of the invasive activity and particularly partially restored the sensitivity to TMZ. Therefore, YKL&#x2011;40 may be a novel key molecule in addition to MGMT, that is responsible for TMZ resistance in glioblastoma cell lines and could be a new target to overcome TMZ resistance in recurrent glioblastomas in the future.",

    "title": "Molecular dynamics, dynamic site mapping, and highthroughput virtual screening on leptin and the Ob receptor as anti-obesity target.",
    "abstract": "Body weight control is a mechanism finely regulated by several hormonal, metabolic, and nervous pathways. The leptin receptor (Ob-R) is crucial for energy homeostasis and regulation of food uptake. Leptin is a 16&#xa0;kDa hormone that is mainly secreted by fat cells into the bloodstream, and under normal circumstances, circulating levels are proportionate to the fat body mass. Sensing of elevated leptin levels by the hypothalamic neurocircutry activates a negative feedback loop resulting in reduced food intake and increased energy expenditure. Decreased concentrations lead to opposite effects. Therefore rational design of leptin agonists constitute an appealing challenge in the battle against obesity. In this study, we performed protein-protein docking among the re-built crystal structure of leptin and leptin binding domain (LBD). The obtained complex was used as a starting point to carry out nanosecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the key regions in terms of physical-chemical features involved in the protein-protein interaction (dynamic site mapping filtered by means multivariate analysis) and used to carry out a HTVS. The main goal of this study was to suggest guidelines for the rational drug design of new agonists of leptin. Identified hits could be a consistent starting point to carry out in vitro testing.",

    "title": "Resistin as a factor in osteoarthritis: synovial fluid resistin concentrations correlate positively with interleukin 6 and matrix metalloproteinases MMP-1 and MMP-3.",
    "abstract": "Resistin is an adipocytokine that has been related to inflammation and insulin resistance. Following knee injury, elevated levels of resistin have been found in synovial fluid (SF) while very little is known about the role of resistin in osteoarthritis (OA). The aim of the present study was to investigate resistin levels in OA joints and to determine if it is associated with inflammatory and catabolic factors in the joints. SF, plasma, and cartilage samples were collected from 88 OA patients undergoing knee replacement surgery. Resistin levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in SF, plasma, and cartilage culture media. Significant levels of resistin [0.75 (0.67) ng/mL; median (IQR)] were found in SF from OA patients. Resistin correlated positively with interleukin (IL)-6 (r = 0.39, p &lt; 0.001) and with matrix metalloproteinases MMP-1 (r = 0.31, p = 0.004) and MMP-3 (r = 0.24, p = 0.024) in SF. Resistin was also released from cultured OA cartilage and it correlated with resistin levels in SF (r = 0.39, p &lt; 0.001). In addition, resistin levels in plasma correlated positively with those in SF (r = 0.44, p &lt; 0.001). There were no differences in SF or plasma resistin concentrations between females and males or between non-diabetic and diabetic patients, and resistin did not correlate with body mass index (BMI). Resistin is present in OA joints and is released from OA cartilage. Levels of resistin in SF are associated with inflammatory and catabolic factors, suggesting that resistin has a role to play in the pathogenesis of, and as a possible drug target in, OA.",

    "abstract": "Glucocorticoid secretion is a key endocrine response to stress. It has been reported that prenatal stress induces long-lasting alterations in body weight regulation systems, which persist after the stress has ceased. In this study, the long-term effects of prenatal glucocorticoid exposure on body weight changes and the expression of appetite-regulating factors were examined in female rats. Pregnant rats were given normal drinking water (control) or dexamethasone (1 &#x3bc;g/mL) dissolved in drinking water (DEX) from day 13 of pregnancy until delivery. Then, the body weight change, serum leptin levels, and hypothalamic NPY mRNA levels of their offspring were examined. The DEX dams gained significantly less body weight during pregnancy than the control dams. The DEX dams' offspring exhibited a significantly lower birth weight than the offspring of the control dams, and the same was true for body weight at postnatal days 20 and 28. The offspring of the DEX dams displayed significantly higher serum leptin levels and significantly lower hypothalamic NPY mRNA levels compared with the offspring of the control dams. Significant inverse correlations were detected between body weight and the serum leptin level, and between the serum leptin level and the hypothalamic NPY mRNA level. On the other hand, a significant positive correlation was detected between body weight and the hypothalamic NPY mRNA level. These results indicate that leptin production is increased in a long-lasting manner in offspring exposed to glucocorticoids during the prenatal period and that this results in attenuated body weight gain and hypothalamic NPY expression during the pre-pubertal period.",

    "title": "The chemerin receptor 23 agonist, chemerin, attenuates monosynaptic C-fibre input to lamina I neurokinin 1 receptor expressing rat spinal cord neurons in inflammatory pain.",
    "abstract": "Recent evidence has shown that the chemerin receptor 23 (ChemR23) represents a novel inflammatory pain target, whereby the ChemR23 agonists, resolvin E1 and chemerin, can inhibit inflammatory pain hypersensitivity, by a mechanism that involves normalisation of potentiated spinal cord responses. This study has examined the ability of the ChemR23 agonist, chemerin, to modulate synaptic input to lamina I neurokinin 1 receptor expressing (NK1R+) dorsal horn neurons, which are known to be crucial for the manifestation of inflammatory pain. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from pre-identified lamina I NK1R+ neurons, in rat spinal cord slices, revealed that chemerin significantly attenuates capsaicin potentiation of miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequency, but is without effect in non-potentiated conditions. In tissue isolated from complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) treated rats, chemerin significantly reduced the peak amplitude of monosynaptic C-fibre evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs) in a subset of lamina I NK1R+ neurons, termed chemerin responders. However, chemerin did not alter the peak amplitude of monosynaptic C-fibre eEPSCs in control tissue. Furthermore, paired-pulse recordings in CFA tissue demonstrated that chemerin significantly reduced paired-pulse depression in the subset of neurons classified as chemerin responders, but was without effect in non-responders, indicating that chemerin acts presynaptically to attenuate monosynaptic C-fibre input to a subset of lamina I NK1R+ neurons. These results suggest that the reported ability of ChemR23 agonists to attenuate inflammatory pain hypersensitivity may in part be due to a presynaptic inhibition of monosynaptic C-fibre input to lamina I NK1R+ neurons and provides further evidence that ChemR23 represents a promising inflammatory pain target.",

    "abstract": "Geldanamycin derivatives are benzoquinone ansamycin antibiotics that bind to Hsp90 and alter its function. The alteration of Hsp90 activity limits some cellular hormonal responses by inhibiting nuclear receptors activation. The nuclear receptors activity, such as PPAR&#x3b3;, the mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors (MR and GR) play a critical role in the conversion of preadipocytes to mature adipocytes. Given the importance of these nuclear receptors for adipogenesis, we investigated the effects of geldanamycin analogues (GA) on adipocyte differentiation and function. We found that early exposure of preadipocyte cells to GA inhibited their conversion into mature adipocytes by inhibiting the adipogenic transcriptional program and lipid droplets accumulation. Furthermore, GA altered the adipokines secretion profile of mature adipocyte. The anti-adipogenic effect of GA was also confirmed in mice fed a high fat diet. Biochemical analysis revealed that anti-adipogenic effects of geldanamycin analogues may result from the simultaneous inhibition of MR, GR and PPAR&#x3b3; activity. Taken together, our observations lead us to propose Hsp90 as a potent target for drug development in the control of obesity and its related metabolic complications.",

    "abstract": "Exposing the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to stress causes the accumulation of unfolded proteins, and subsequently results in ER stress. ER stress may be involved in various disorders such as obesity, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases. Leptin is an important circulating hormone, that inhibits food intake and accelerates energy consumption, which suppresses body weight gain. Recent studies demonstrated that leptin resistance is one of the main factors involved in the development of obesity. We and other groups recently reported the role of ER stress in the development of leptin resistance. Therefore, identifying drugs that target ER stress may be a promising fundamental strategy for the treatment of obesity. In the present study, we investigated whether caffeine could affect ER stress and the subsequent development of leptin resistance. We showed that caffeine exhibited chaperone activity, which attenuated protein aggregation. Caffeine also inhibited the ER stress-induced activation of IRE1 and PERK, which suggested the attenuation of ER stress. Moreover, caffeine markedly improved ER stress-induced impairments in the leptin-induced phosphorylation of STAT3. Therefore, these results suggest caffeine may have pharmacological properties that ameliorate leptin resistance by reducing ER stress.",

    "abstract": "Resistin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) are adipokines, which are secreted from adipocytes. Increased plasma resistin and PAI-1 levels aggravate metabolic syndrome through exacerbation of insulin resistance and induction of chronic inflammation. However, the relationship between resistin and PAI-1 gene expression remains unclear. Previously, we found that resistin regulates lipid metabolism via carbohydrate responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) during adipocyte maturation (Ikeda et al., 2013) [6]. In this study, to clarify the relationship between expression of resistin and PAI-1, PAI-1 expression in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes was measured after transfection with anti-resistin siRNA. We found that PAI-1 gene expression and secreted PAI-1 protein were significantly decreased by resistin knockdown. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Akt, which can inhibit PAI-1 expression, was accelerated and the activity of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) was suppressed in resistin knockdown 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In addition, the expression of glucose transporter type 4, a ChREBP target gene, was reduced and was associated with inhibition of PP2A. The addition of culture medium collected from COS7 cells transfected with a resistin expression plasmid rescued the suppression of PAI-1 expression in resistin knockdown 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Our findings suggest that resistin regulates PAI-1 expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes via Akt phosphorylation.",

    "title": "Pre-pubertal serum leptin levels and sensitivity to central leptin injection of prenatally undernourished female rats.",
    "abstract": "It has been reported that intrauterine undernutrition is closely associated with the pathogeneses of certain diseases in adulthood; i.e., insulin resistance and diabetes, and that leptin resistance plays a pivotal role in the pathology of such intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)-related conditions. Therefore, examinations of IUGR-induced leptin resistance in early developmental period are important for protecting against future disease. In this study, the effects of prenatal undernutrition on the serum leptin levels and central leptin responses of rats during the neonatal and/or pre-pubertal period were examined. The 50% food-restricted undernourished dams' offspring (UNO) exhibited a significantly lower birth weight than the normal nutrition dams' offspring (NNO). However, the UNO grew rapidly, and their mean body weight had caught up with that of the NNO by postnatal day 8. Thus, there were no significant differences between the body weights of the two groups at postnatal day 12, 16, 20, or 28. The serum leptin levels of the UNO were significantly higher than those of the NNO at postnatal days 20 and 28. At postnatal day 28, no significant difference in the hypothalamic mRNA level of neuropeptide Y, which is the main target of leptin, or that of ObRb, which is the leptin receptor, was detected between the NNO and UNO. The chronic intracerebroventricular injection of leptin attenuated body weight gain in both the NNO and UNO; however, there were no significant differences between the body weights of the two groups at any of the examined postnatal time points, indicating that the UNO and NNO exhibited similar central sensitivity to leptin during the pre-pubertal period. These results suggest that prenatal undernutrition induces leptin resistance until the neonatal to pre-pubertal period and that these alterations might be caused by impaired transportation of leptin to central tissues.",

    "title": "Back to the heart: the protective role of adiponectin.",
    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide and the prevalence of obesity and diabetes are increasing. In obesity, adipose tissue increases the secretion of bioactive mediators (adipokines) that may represent a key mechanism linking obesity to CVD. Adiponectin, extensively studied in metabolic diseases, exerts anti-diabetic, anti-atherogenic and anti-inflammatory activities. Due to these positive actions, the role of adiponectin in cardiovascular protection has been evaluated in recent years. In particular, for its potential therapeutic benefits in humans, adiponectin has become the subject of intense preclinical research. In the cardiovascular context, understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the adiponectin system, throughout its secretion, regulation and signaling, is critical for designing new drugs that target adiponectin system molecules. This review focused on recent advances regarding molecular mechanisms related to protective effects of the adiponectin system on both cardiac and vascular compartments and its potential use as a target for therapeutic intervention of CVD.",

    "abstract": "The fundamental questions of what represents a macronutritionally balanced diet and how this maintains health and longevity remain unanswered. Here, the Geometric Framework, a state-space nutritional modeling method, was used to measure interactive effects of dietary energy, protein, fat, and carbohydrate on food intake, cardiometabolic phenotype, and longevity in mice fed one of 25 diets ad libitum. Food intake was regulated primarily by protein and carbohydrate content. Longevity and health were optimized when protein was replaced with carbohydrate to limit compensatory feeding for protein and suppress protein intake. These consequences are associated with hepatic mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation and mitochondrial function and, in turn, related to circulating branched-chain amino acids and glucose. Calorie restriction achieved by high-protein diets or dietary dilution had no beneficial effects on lifespan. The results suggest that longevity can be extended in ad libitum-fed animals by manipulating the ratio of macronutrients to inhibit mTOR activation.",

    "abstract": "While genome-wide association studies as well as candidate gene studies have revealed a great deal of insight into the contribution of genetics to obesity development and susceptibility, advances in adipose tissue research have substantially changed the understanding of adipose tissue function. Its perception has changed from passive lipid storage tissue to active endocrine organ regulating and modulating whole-body energy homeostasis and metabolism and inflammatory and immune responses by secreting a multitude of bioactive molecules, termed adipokines. The expression of human vaspin (serpinA12) is positively correlated to body mass index and insulin sensitivity and increases glucose tolerance in vivo, suggesting a compensatory role in response to diminished insulin signaling in obesity. Recently, considerable insight has been gained into vaspin structure, function, and specific target tissue-dependent effects, and several lines of evidence suggest vaspin as a promising candidate for drug development for the treatment of obesity-related insulin resistance and inflammation. These will be summarized in this review with a focus on molecular mechanisms and pathways.",

    "abstract": "To investigate whether inulin-type fructan (ITF) prebiotics could counteract the thiazolidinedione (TZD, PPAR&#x3b3; activator) induced-fat mass gain, without affecting its beneficial effect on glucose homeostasis, in high-fat (HF) diet fed mice. Male C57bl6/J mice were fed a HF diet alone or supplemented with ITF prebiotics (0.2 g/day &#xd7; mouse) or TZD (30 mg pioglitazone (PIO)/kg body weight &#xd7; day) or both during 4 weeks. An insulin tolerance test was performed after 3 weeks of treatment. As expected, PIO improved glucose homeostasis and increased adiponectinaemia. Furthermore, it induced an over-expression of several PPAR&#x3b3; target genes in white adipose tissues. ITF prebiotics modulated the PIO-induced PPAR&#x3b3; activation in a tissue-dependent manner. The co-treatment with ITF prebiotics and PIO maintained the beneficial impact of TZD on glucose homeostasis and adiponectinaemia. Moreover, the combination of both treatments reduced fat mass accumulation, circulating lipids and hepatic triglyceride content, suggesting an overall improvement of metabolism. Finally, the co-treatment favored induction of white-to-brown fat conversion in subcutaneous adipose tissue, thereby leading to the development of brite adipocytes that could increase the oxidative capacity of the tissue. ITF prebiotics decrease adiposity and improve the metabolic response in HF fed mice treated with TZD.",

    "title": "High-fructose diet leads to visceral adiposity and hypothalamic leptin resistance in male rats--do glucocorticoids play a role?",
    "abstract": "Fructose overconsumption has been involved in the genesis and progression of the metabolic syndrome. Hypothalamus and adipose tissue, major organs for control of food intake and energy metabolism, play crucial roles in metabolic homeostasis. We hypothesized that glucocorticoid signaling mediates the effects of a fructose-enriched diet on visceral adiposity by acting on neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the hypothalamus and altering adipogenic transcription factors in the visceral adipose tissue. We analyzed the effects of 9-week consumption of 60% fructose solution on dyslipidemia, insulin and leptin sensitivity, and adipose tissue histology in male Wistar rats. Glucocorticoid signaling was assessed in both hypothalamus and visceral adipose tissue, while the levels of peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor &#x3b3; (PPAR&#x3b3;), sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) and lipin-1, together with the levels of their target genes expression, were analyzed in the visceral adipose tissue. The results showed that long-term consumption of highly concentrated liquid fructose led to the development of visceral adiposity, elevated triglycerides and hypothalamic leptin resistance accompanied by stimulated glucocorticoid signaling and NPY mRNA elevation. Results from adipose tissue implied that fructose consumption shifted the balance between glucocorticoid receptor and adipogenic transcriptional factors (PPAR&#x3b3;, SREBP-1 and lipin-1) in favor of adipogenesis judged by distinctly separated populations of small adipocytes observed in this tissue. In summary, we propose that high-fructose-diet-induced alterations of glucocorticoid signaling in both hypothalamus and adipose tissue result in enhanced adipogenesis, possibly serving as an adaptation to energy excess in order to limit deposition of fat in nonadipose tissues.",

    "title": "Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase attenuates hepatocellular carcinoma cell adhesion stimulated by adipokine resistin.",
    "abstract": "Resistin, adipocyte-secreting adipokine, may play critical role in modulating cancer pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of resistin on HCC adhesion to the endothelium, and the mechanism underlying these resistin effects. Human SK-Hep1 cells were used to study the effect of resistin on intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expressions as well as NF-&#x3ba;B activation, and hence cell adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-&#x3b2;-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR), an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator, was used to determine the regulatory role of AMPK on HCC adhesion to the endothelium in regard to the resistin effects. Treatment with resistin increased the adhesion of SK-Hep1 cells to HUVECs and concomitantly induced NF-&#x3ba;B activation, as well as ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expressions in SK-Hep1 cells. Using specific blocking antibodies and siRNAs, we found that resistin-induced SK-Hep1 cell adhesion to HUVECs was through NF-&#x3ba;B-regulated ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expressions. Moreover, treatment with AICAR demonstrated that AMPK activation in SK-Hep1 cells significantly attenuates the resistin effect on SK-Hep1 cell adhesion to HUVECs. These results clarify the role of resistin in inducing HCC adhesion to the endothelium and demonstrate the inhibitory effect of AMPK activation under the resistin stimulation. Our findings provide a notion that resistin play an important role to promote HCC metastasis and implicate AMPK may be a therapeutic target to against HCC metastasis.",

    "title": "Cot/tpl2 participates in the activation of macrophages by adiponectin.",
    "abstract": "Whereas the main function of APN is to enhance insulin activity, it is also involved in modulating the macrophage phenotype. Here, we demonstrate that at physiological concentrations, APN activates Erk1/2 via the IKK&#x3b2;-p105/NF-&#x3ba;&#x392;1-Cot/tpl2 intracellular signal transduction cassette in macrophages. In peritoneal macrophages stimulated with APN, Cot/tpl2 influences the ability to phagocytose beads. However, Cot/tpl2 did not modulate the known capacity of APN to decrease lipid content in peritoneal macrophages in response to treatment with oxLDL or acLDL. A microarray analysis of gene-expression profiles in BMDMs exposed to APN revealed that APN modulated the expression of &#x223c;3300 genes; the most significantly affected biological functions were the inflammatory and the infectious disease responses. qRT-PCR analysis of WT and Cot/tpl2 KO macrophages stimulated with APN for 0, 3, and 18 h revealed that Cot/tpl2 participated in the up-regulation of APN target inflammatory mediators included in the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway (KEGG ID 4060). In accordance with these data, macrophages stimulated with APN increased secretion of cytokines and chemokines, including IL-1&#x3b2;, IL-1&#x3b1;, TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-10, IL-12, IL-6, and CCL2. Moreover, Cot/tpl2 also played an important role in the production of these inflammatory mediators upon stimulation of macrophages with APN. It has been reported that different types of signals that stimulate TLRs, IL-1R, TNFR, Fc&#x3b3;R, and proteinase-activated receptor-1 activate Cot/tpl2. Here, we demonstrate that APN is a new signal that activates the IKK&#x3b2;-p105/NF-&#x3ba;&#x392;1-Cot/tpl2-MKK1/2-Erk1/2 axis in macrophages. Furthermore, this signaling cassette modulates the biological functions triggered by APN in macrophages.",

To evaluate LD prevalence and subtypes in HIV treatment-multiexperienced patients, and to determine the correlations between adipocytokines and LD subtypes. Cross-sectional study in a Romanian tertiary care hospital, between 2008 and 2010, in HIV-positive patients, undergoing cART for &#x2265;6 months. LD diagnosis, based on clinical and anthropometric data, was classified into lipoatrophy (LA), lipohypertrophy (LH) and mixed fat redistribution (MFR). Blood samples were collected for leptin, adiponectin and resistin assessments. We included 100 patients, 44 % with LD, among which LA had 63 %. LA patients had sex ratio, median age, treatment duration and median number of ARV regimens of 1, 20, 93 and 3.5 compared to non-LD patients: 1.65, 31, 44 and 1. LH and MFR patients were older and had higher total and LDL cholesterol versus non-LD patients. For both overall group and female group, LA was associated in univariate and multivariate analysis with increased resistin (p = 0.02 and 0.04) and number of ARV regimens (p &lt; 0.001). Determination coefficient (Nagelkerke R (2)) of increased resistin and the number of ARV combinations in the presence of LA was 33 % in overall group and 47 % in female patients. In our young HIV-positive population, LD had high prevalence with predominance of LA subtype. LA was associated with high resistin levels and greater number of ARV regimens in overall group and female subgroup. Resistin could be used as a marker of peripheral adipose tissue loss and might be used as a target for new anti-LD therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "The development of atherosclerosis (AS) is a multifactorial process, in which elevated plasma resistin (a key factor leading to insulin resistance) levels play an important role. Emerging evidence indicate that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in AS; However, the regulation and function of miRNAs in response to AS remain poorly understood. Our study analyzed the effects of miR-492 on insulin resistance, endothelial activation, and resistin expression in apoE knock-out mice and human umbilical vein endothelial cells after high-glucose treatment and miR-492 mimics transfection. We also investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our results showed that high glucose stress induced a significant decrease in miR-492 expression, with a remarkable upregulation of resistin expression. We then identified resistin as a novel direct target of miR-492 using 3'-UTR luciferase reporter assay. Histopathologic examination demonstrated that upregulation of miR-492 attenuated endothelial cells migration and lipid accumulation induced by high glucose stress. Further investigation demonstrated that the upregulation of p-STAT3, SOCS, and P-selectin activation induced by high glucose stress was attenuated by upregulation of miR-492. Together, our findings indicate that miR-492 contributes to insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction induced by high glucose, via directly downregulating resistin expression, and involving STAT3 phosphorylation, SOCS, and P-selectin activation.",

    "title": "Fermentation of soy milk via Lactobacillus plantarum improves dysregulated lipid metabolism in rats on a high cholesterol diet.",
    "abstract": "We aimed to investigate whether in vitro fermentation of soy with L. plantarum could promote its beneficial effects on lipids at the molecular and physiological levels. Rats were fed an AIN76A diet containing 50% sucrose (w/w) (CTRL), a modified AIN76A diet supplemented with 1% (w/w) cholesterol (CHOL), or a CHOL diet where 20% casein was replaced with soy milk (SOY) or fermented soy milk (FSOY). Dietary isoflavone profiles, serum lipids, hepatic and fecal cholesterol, and tissue gene expression were examined. The FSOY diet had more aglycones than did the SOY diet. Both the SOY and FSOY groups had lower hepatic cholesterol and serum triglyceride (TG) than did the CHOL group. Only FSOY reduced hepatic TG and serum free fatty acids and increased serum HDL-CHOL and fecal cholesterol. Compared to CHOL, FSOY lowered levels of the nuclear forms of SREBP-1c and SREBP-2 and expression of their target genes, including FAS, SCD1, LDLR, and HMGCR. On the other hand, FSOY elevated adipose expression levels of genes involved in TG-rich lipoprotein uptake (ApoE, VLDLR, and Lrp1), fatty acid oxidation (PPAR&#x3b1;, CPT1&#x3b1;, LCAD, CYP4A1, UCP2, and UCP3), HDL-biogenesis (ABCA1, ApoA1, and LXR&#x3b1;), and adiponectin signaling (AdipoQ, AdipoR1, and AdipoR2), as well as levels of phosphorylated AMPK and ACC. SOY conferred a similar expression profile in both liver and adipose tissues but failed to reach statistical significance in many of the genes tested, unlike FSOY. Our data indicate that fermentation may be a way to enhance the beneficial effects of soy on lipid metabolism, in part via promoting a reduction of SREBP-dependent cholesterol and TG synthesis in the liver, and enhancing adiponectin signaling and PPAR&#x3b1;-induced expression of genes involved in TG-rich lipoprotein clearance, fatty acid oxidation, and reverse cholesterol transport in adipose tissues.",

    "abstract": "Vaspin is an adipocytokine that was recently identified in the visceral adipose tissue of diabetic rats and has anti-diabetic and anti-atherogenic effects. We hypothesized that vaspin prevents inflammatory cytokine-induced nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-&#x3ba;B) activation by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in vascular endothelial cells. We examined the effects of vaspin on NF-&#x3ba;B activation and the expression of the NF-&#x3ba;B-mediated genes intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), E-selectin, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Human aortic endothelial cells (HAECS) were used. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#x3b1;) was used as a representative proinflammatory cytokine. Treatment with vaspin significantly increased the phosphorylation of AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the down-stream target of AMPK. Furthermore, treatment with vaspin significantly decreased TNF&#x3b1;-induced activation of NF-&#x3ba;B, as well as the expression of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, and MCP-1. These effects were abolished following transfection of AMPK&#x3b1;1-specific small interfering RNA. In an adhesion assay using THP-1 cells, vaspin reduced TNF&#x3b1;-induced adhesion of monocytes to HAECS in an AMPK-dependent manner. Vaspin might attenuate the cytokine-induced expression of adhesion molecule genes by inhibiting NF-&#x3ba;B following AMPK activation.",

    "abstract": "Leptin plays an important role in reproductive function, and the mechanism of this phenomenon primarily focuses on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. However, until now, the direct effects of leptin on the testes during development from infancy to adulthood remained unclear. The aim of the present study was to explore the effects and molecular mechanisms that underlie leptin's action in the testes during sexual maturation. We used a monosodium glutamate (MSG)-treated mouse model to assess the effects of endogenous hyperleptinemia on the development of the testes from infancy to adulthood. Then, a variety of reproductive parameters were measured, including the concentration of testosterone, the weight and volume of the testicles, the diameter of the seminiferous tubules, and numbers of spermatogonia, spermatocytes, sperm, Leydig cells and offspring. In addition, we assessed the direct role of leptin and suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3)/phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3) on the testes in vitro. Testosterone secretion exhibited a diverse response: a low concentration of leptin induced testosterone secretion, and a high concentration inhibited testosterone secretion both in vivo and in vitro. A variety of reproductive parameters decreased in hyperleptinemic mice, including the weight and volume of the testicles, the diameter of the seminiferous tubules, and the numbers of spermatocytes, sperm, Leydig cells and offspring. The amount of spermatogonia was also elevated. The development of the testes was partially recovered after hyperleptinemia withdrawal. A high concentration of leptin induced SOCS3 expression and inhibited pSTAT3 expression in the testes. The results indicated that MSG-induced hyperleptinemia directly affects testicular structure and function and that SOCS3/pSTAT3 played an important role in this process. These results also indicated the importance of monitoring and controlling leptin levels in obese male children. SOCS3 is a potential therapeutic target for leptin-induced dysgenesis.",

    "title": "Perivascular fat, AMP-activated protein kinase and vascular diseases.",
    "abstract": "Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is an active endocrine and paracrine organ that modulates vascular function, with implications for the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Adipocytes and stromal cells contained within PVAT produce mediators (adipokines, cytokines, reactive oxygen species and gaseous compounds) with a range of paracrine effects modulating vascular smooth muscle cell contraction, proliferation and migration. However, the modulatory effect of PVAT on the vascular system in diseases, such as obesity, hypertension and atherosclerosis, remains poorly characterized. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates adipocyte metabolism, adipose biology and vascular function, and hence may be a potential therapeutic target for metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and the vascular complications associated with obesity and T2DM. The role of AMPK in PVAT or the actions of PVAT have yet to be established, however. Activation of AMPK by pharmacological agents, such as metformin and thiazolidinediones, may modulate the activity of PVAT surrounding blood vessels and thereby contribute to their beneficial effect in cardiometabolic diseases. This review will provide a current perspective on how PVAT may influence vascular function via AMPK. We will also attempt to demonstrate how modulating AMPK activity using pharmacological agents could be exploited therapeutically to treat cardiometabolic diseases.",

    "title": "Adipocytokine resistin correlates with oxidative stress and myocardial injury in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.",
    "abstract": "Adipocytokines are hormones regulating energy metabolism and appetite and according to recent reports also inflammatory responses including ischaemia-reperfusion injury. Based on experimental data, we hypothesized that the levels of adipocytokines adiponectin, adipsin, leptin and/or resistin would correlate with myocardial injury, inflammation and oxidative stress during cardiac surgery. Thirty-two patients undergoing an elective on-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were recruited into the study. Blood samples were collected after the induction of anaesthesia, and at the onset of CPB, 1 and 15 min after the removal of aortic cross-clamp and 4 and 24 h after the onset of CPB. Samples were analysed for levels of four adipocytokines (adiponectin, adipsin, leptin and resistin) and markers of oxidative stress [myeloperoxidase (MPO) and 8-isoprostane], inflammation [interleukin-6 (IL-6)] and myocardial injury [troponin T (TnT)]. Adiponectin and adipsin concentrations declined, while leptin and resistin levels increased significantly by 24 h after the onset of the operation. Interestingly, basal levels of resistin (r = 0.41, P = 0.020) as well as the maximal increase occurring in resistin levels during the 24-h follow-up (r = 0.49, P = 0.005) correlated positively with TnT release. In addition, the reperfusion-induced elevation in resistin levels correlated positively with oxidative stress measured as increases in MPO concentrations. As an original finding, we report here that resistin levels correlate with oxidative stress and myocardial injury in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. In addition, leptin levels were increased on the first postoperative day, but only minor declines were found in adiponectin and adipsin levels. Resistin has been implicated in unfavourable metabolic, cardiovascular and inflammatory responses: it may thus serve as a useful biomarker or a drug target in conditions complicated by ischaemia-reperfusion injury.",

    "title": "Effect of adiponectin on cardiac &#x3b2;-catenin signaling pathway under angiotensin II infusion.",
    "abstract": "Obesity is associated with heart failure and cardiac hypertrophy. Adiponectin has been shown to play a protective role for cardiovascular diseases. The &#x3b2;-catenin signaling pathway is deeply involved in cardiac hypertrophy. However, the effect of adiponectin on &#x3b2;-catenin signaling has not been investigated in cardiac hypertrophy. Present study aimed to clarify the involvement of adiponectin and &#x3b2;-catenin signaling pathway in the mouse model of angiotensin II (AngII)-induced cardiac hypertrophy. In hearts of Wild type (WT) mice, AngII dose-dependently augmented cytosolic &#x3b2;-catenin protein level. WT and adiponectin knockout (Adipo-KO) mice were administered with AngII at 2.4 mg/kg/day for 14 days and were also injected with adenovirus expressing the adiponectin (Ad-Adipo) or the &#x3b2;-galactosidase (Ad-&#x3b2;gal). Cardiac mRNA levels relating to hypertrophy and &#x3b2;-catenin signaling were increased in Adipo-KO mice and these changes were reversed by Ad-Adipo. Phosphorylation of Akt was increased in Adipo-KO mice and such increases were reversed by Ad-Adipo. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3&#x3b2; (GSK3&#x3b2;) at Ser(9) and cytosolic &#x3b2;-catenin level were increased in Adipo-KO mice and they were significantly reduced by Ad-Adipo treatment. Phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was reduced by Ad-Adipo-mediated adiponectin supplementation in WT and Adipo-KO mice. The current study suggests that adiponectin attenuates AngII-induced cardiac hypertrophic signals partly through Akt/GSK3&#x3b2;/&#x3b2;-catenin and Akt/mTOR pathways.",

    "abstract": "Although the underlying mechanism is unclear, &#x3b2;-conglycinin (&#x3b2;CG), the major component of soy proteins, regulates blood glucose levels. Here, we hypothesized that consumption of &#x3b2;CG would normalize blood glucose levels by ameliorating insulin resistance and stimulating glucose uptake in skeletal muscles. To test our hypothesis, we investigated the antidiabetic action of &#x3b2;CG in spontaneously diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats. Our results revealed that plasma adiponectin levels and adiponectin receptor 1 messenger RNA expression in skeletal muscle were higher in &#x3b2;CG-fed rats than in casein-fed rats. Phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMP kinase) but not phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase was activated in &#x3b2;CG-fed GK rats. Subsequently, &#x3b2;CG increased translocation of glucose transporter 4 to the plasma membrane. Unlike the results in skeletal muscle, the increase in adiponectin receptor 1 did not lead to AMP kinase activation in the liver of &#x3b2;CG-fed rats. The down-regulation of sterol regulatory element-binding factor 1, which is induced by low insulin levels, promoted the increase in hepatic insulin receptor substrate 2 expression. Based on these findings, we concluded that consumption of soy &#x3b2;CG improves glucose uptake in skeletal muscle via AMP kinase activation and ameliorates hepatic insulin resistance and that these actions may help normalize blood glucose levels in GK rats.",

    "abstract": "Apelin is highly expressed in the lungs, especially in the pulmonary vasculature, but the functional role of apelin under pathological conditions is still undefined. Hypoxic pulmonary hypertension is the most common cause of acute right heart failure, which may involve the remodeling of artery and regulation of autophagy. In this study, we determined whether treatment with apelin regulated the proliferation and migration of rat pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) under hypoxia, and investigated the underlying mechanism and the relationship with autophagy. Our data showed that hypoxia activated autophagy significantly at 24 hrs. The addition of exogenous apelin decreased the level of autophagy and further inhibited pulmonary arterial SMC (PASMC) proliferation via activating downstream phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/the mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR) signal pathways. The inhibition of the apelin receptor (APJ) system by siRNA abolished the inhibitory effect of apelin in PASMCs under hypoxia. This study provides the evidence that exogenous apelin treatment contributes to inhibit the proliferation and migration of PASMCs by regulating the level of autophagy.",

    "abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, caused by the accumulation of unfolded proteins, is involved in the development of obesity. We demonstrated that flurbiprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), exhibited chaperone activity, which reduced protein aggregation and alleviated ER stress-induced leptin resistance, characterized by insensitivity to the actions of the anti-obesity hormone leptin. This result was further supported by flurbiprofen attenuating high-fat diet-induced obesity in mice. The other NSAIDs tested did not exhibit such effects, which suggested that this anti-obesity action is mediated independent of NSAIDs. Using ferriteglycidyl methacrylate beads, we identified aldehyde dehydrogenase as the target of flurbiprofen, but not of the other NSAIDs. These results suggest that flurbiprofen may have unique pharmacological properties that reduce the accumulation of unfolded proteins and may represent a new class of drug for the fundamental treatment of obesity.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is linked to increased cancer risk. Pathological expansion of adipose tissue impacts adipocyte function and secretion of hormonal factors regulating tissue homeostasis and metabolism. Adiponectin is an adipocyte-secreted, circulating hormone with pleiotropic functions in lipid and glucose metabolism, and beneficial roles in cardiovascular functions and inflammation. In obesity, decreased Adiponectin plasma levels correlate with tumor development and progression. The association of Adiponectin with potential tumor-limiting functions has raised significant interest in exploring this adipokine as a target for cancer-diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Recent studies, however, also implicate Adiponectin in supporting malignancy. This review highlights the evidence that links Adiponectin signaling to either cancer-protective or cancer-supporting functions. In this context, we discuss Adiponectin interactions with its receptors and associated signaling pathways. Despite significant advances in understanding Adiponectin functions and signaling mechanisms, its role in cancer remains multifaceted and subject to controversy.",

Skeletal muscle is an important target tissue for adiponectin where it regulates glucose and fatty acid metabolism directly and via insulin sensitizing effects. Cell surface receptors and the intracellular signaling events via which adiponectin orchestrates metabolism are now becoming well characterized. The initially accepted dogma of adiponectin action was that the physiological effects were mediated via endocrine effects of adipose-derived adiponectin. However, in recent years it has been established that skeletal muscle can also produce and secrete adiponectin that can elicit important functional effects. There is evidence that skeletal muscle adiponectin resistance may develop in obesity and play a role in the pathogenesis of diabetes. In summary, adiponectin acting in an autocrine and endocrine manner has important metabolic and insulin sensitizing effects on skeletal muscle which contribute to the overall anti-diabetic outcome of adiponectin action.",

The adipokine exerts its insulin-sensitizing effects by alleviation of obesity-induced ectopic lipid accumulation, lipotoxicity and chronic inflammation, as well as by direct cross-talk with insulin signaling cascades. Adiponectin and insulin signaling pathways converge at the adaptor protein APPL1. On the one hand, APPL1 interacts with adiponectin receptors and mediates both metabolic and vascular actions of adiponectin through activation of AMP-activated protein kinase and p38 MAP kinase. On the other hand, APPL1 potentiates both the actions and secretion of insulin by fine-tuning the Akt activity in multiple insulin target tissues. In obese animals, reduced APPL1 expression contributes to both insulin resistance and defective insulin secretion. This review summarizes recent advances on the molecular mechanisms by which adiponectin sensitizes insulin actions, and discusses the roles of APPL1 in regulating both adiponectin and insulin signaling cascades.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin has been shown to play a critical role in immunity. Recently, we reported that the adiponectin levels after allogeneic stem cell transplantation were higher in recipients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD). However, the effects of adiponectin on extracellular matrix (ECM) and regulatory factors in dermal fibroblasts remain unclear. We compared the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of collagen type1 (COL1A), fibronectin 1 (FN1), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)1, MMP3, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)1, TIMP3, transforming growth factor-&#x3b2; (TGF-&#x3b2;), and TGF-&#x3b2; receptor 2 (TGF-&#x3b2;R2) in human normal dermal fibroblasts cultured with and without adiponectin, and we assessed the degree of synthesis of ECMs by immunofluorescent microscopy. Furthermore, we also assessed these mRNA levels after blocking of TGF-&#x3b2;R2. Adiponectin induced higher mRNA levels of FN1, MMP1, MMP3, TIMP1, TIMP3, and TGF-&#x3b2;R2 in a dose-dependent manner, but did not significantly affect COL1A or TGF-&#x3b2;. In addition, adiponectin was shown to upregulate FN1, MMPs, and TIMPs after blocking of TGF-&#x3b2;R2. Immunofluorescent microscopy revealed that adiponectin promoted a greater synthesis of ECMs than in the control in vitro. The finding that adiponectin upregulated ECM-associated factors might mean that high levels of adiponectin could modulate dermal fibrosis was observed in recipients with cGVHD. Further basic investigation is warranted to elucidate whether the adiponectin-pathway could be a target for the treatment of sclerotic cGVHD.",

Here we present a novel strategy to engineer immunocytokines with very high targeting efficacies. The method lies in the use of mutants of toxic cytokines that markedly reduce their receptor-binding affinities, and that are thus rendered essentially inactive. Upon fusion to nanobodies specifically binding to marker proteins, activity of these cytokines is selectively restored for cell populations expressing this marker. This 'activity-by-targeting' concept was validated for type I interferons and leptin. In the case of interferon, activity can be directed to target cells in vitro and to selected cell populations in mice, with up to 1,000-fold increased specific activity. This targeting strategy holds promise to revitalize the clinical potential of many cytokines.",

Several metabolic mediators, such as adiponectin, have been suspected to play a role in obesity-related carcinogenesis.

Other studies have investigated the effect of adiponectin under the normal and high-fat diet conditions in a mouse model of azoxymethane-induced colon cancer. Enhanced formation of both ACF and tumors was observed in the adiponectin-deficient mice, as compared with that in the wild-type, under the high-fat diet condition but not under the normal diet condition. Furthermore, that the 5'-AMP-activated kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway is involved in the promotion of colorectal carcinogenesis in adiponectin-deficient mice under the high-fat diet condition was shown. Therefore, that the 5'-AMP-activated kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway may play an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis was speculated. Metformin, a biguanide derivative widely used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus, has been shown to exert a suppressive effect on ACF formation in both mouse models and humans. Therefore, metformin might be a promising candidate as a safe drug for chemoprevention of colorectal carcinogenesis. Further studies with high evidence levels, such as randomized, controlled studies, are needed to clarify these relationships.",

    "abstract": "The leptin receptor antagonist peptide Allo-aca exhibits picomolar activities in various cellular systems and sub-mg/kg subcutaneous efficacies in animal models making it a prime drug candidate and target validation tool. Here we identified the biochemical basis for its remarkable in vivo activity. Allo-aca decomposed within 30 min in pooled human serum and was undetectable beyond the same time period from mouse plasma during pharmacokinetic measurements. The C max of 8.9 &#x3bc;g/mL at 5 min corresponds to approximately 22% injected peptide present in the circulation. The half-life was extended to over 2 h in bovine vitreous fluid and 10 h in human tears suggesting potential efficacy in ophthalmic diseases. The peptide retained picomolar anti-proliferation activity against a chronic myeloid leukemia cell line; addition of a C-terminal biotin label increased the IC50 value by approximately 200-fold. In surface plasmon resonance assays with the biotin-labeled peptide immobilized to a NeutrAvidin-coated chip, Allo-aca exhibited exceptionally tight binding to the binding domain of the human leptin receptor with ka = 5 &#xd7; 10(5) M(-1) s(-1) and kdiss = 1.5 &#xd7; 10(-4) s(-1) values. Peptides excel in terms of high activity and selectivity to their targets, and may activate or inactivate receptor functions considerably longer than molecular turnovers that take place in experimental animals.",

    "title": "Chlorella modulates insulin signaling pathway and prevents high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance in mice.",
    "abstract": "The search for natural agents that minimize obesity-associated disorders is receiving special attention. In this regard, the present study aimed to evaluate the prophylactic effect of Chlorella vulgaris (CV) on body weight, lipid profile, blood glucose and insulin signaling in liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue of diet-induced obese mice. Balb/C mice were fed either with standard rodent chow diet or high-fat diet (HFD) and received concomitant treatment with CV for 12 consecutive weeks. Triglyceride, free fatty acid, total cholesterol and fractions of cholesterol were measured using commercial assay. Insulin and leptin levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Insulin and glucose tolerance tests were performed. The expression and phosphorylation of IR&#x3b2;, IRS-1 and Akt were determined by Western blot analyses. Herein we demonstrate for the first time in the literature that prevention by CV of high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance in obese mice, as shown by increased glucose and insulin tolerance, is in part due to the improvement in the insulin signaling pathway at its main target tissues, by increasing the phosphorylation levels of proteins such as IR, IRS-1 and Akt. In parallel, the lower phosphorylation levels of IRS-1(ser307) were observed in obese mice. We also found that CV administration prevents high-fat diet-induced dyslipidemia by reducing triglyceride, cholesterol and free fatty acid levels. We propose that the modulatory effect of CV treatment preventing the deleterious effects induced by high-fat diet is a good indicator for its use as a prophylactic-therapeutic agent against obesity-related complications.",

    "abstract": "The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is characterized by a cluster of risk factors including central obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, The MetS is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Several international organizations have defined MetS using different diagnostic criteria that produced discrepancies in the results of previous studies, thus leading to the latest Joint Interim Societies (JIS) MetS definition. Other risk factors than the diagnostic criteria that have been associated with MetS include lipid abnormalities, uric acid, liver function, prothrombotic factors, cytokines, adipokines, vitamin D, arterial stiffness, polycystic ovary syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea. Apart from CVD and T2DM, MetS has been related to non-cardiac vascular diseases and in particular to stroke, carotid artery disease, peripheral artery disease, chronic kidney disease, atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and abdominal aortic aneurysms. In this narrative review, the associations of these diseases with MetS and its components will be discussed. These associations may further increase CVD risk in MetS patients, highlighting the importance of treating such high-risk individuals early and to target. In this context, multifactorial treatment including a statin has been proven beneficial, and thus should be considered, in MetS patients.",

    "abstract": "Insulin resistance (IR) has been identified as crucial pathophysiological factor in the development and progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Although mounting evidence suggests that perturbation of gut microflora exacerbates the severity of chronic liver diseases, therapeutic approaches using synbiotic has remained overlooked. Here, we show that a synbiotic composed by Lactobacillus paracasei B21060 plus arabinogalactan and fructo-oligosaccharides lessens NAFLD progression in a rat model of high fat feeding. IR and steatosis were induced by administration of high fat diet (HFD) for 6 weeks. Steatosis and hepatic inflammation, Toll-like receptor (TLR) pattern, glucose tolerance, insulin signaling and gut permeability were studied. Liver inflammatory markers were down-regulated in rats receiving the synbiotic, along with an increased expression of nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and expression of downstream target genes. The synbiotic improved many aspects of IR, such as fasting response, hormonal homeostasis and glycemic control. Indeed it prevented the impairment of hepatic insulin signaling, reducing the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 in Ser 307 and down-regulating suppressor of cytokine signaling 3. Gene expression analysis revealed that in the liver the synbiotic reduced cytokines synthesis and restored the HFD-dysregulated TLR 2, 4 and 9 mRNAs toward a physiological level of expression. The synbiotic preserved gut barrier integrity and reduced the relative amount of Gram-negative Enterobacteriales and Escherichia coli in colonic mucosa. Overall, our data indicate that the L. paracasei B21060 based synbiotic is effective in reducing the severity of liver injury and IR associated with high fat intake, suggesting its possible therapeutic/preventive clinical utilization.",

    "title": "Meta-modeling of methylprednisolone effects on glucose regulation in rats.",
    "abstract": "A retrospective meta-modeling analysis was performed to integrate previously reported data of glucocorticoid (GC) effects on glucose regulation following a single intramuscular dose (50 mg/kg), single intravenous doses (10, 50 mg/kg), and intravenous infusions (0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 mg/kg/h) of methylprednisolone (MPL) in normal and adrenalectomized (ADX) male Wistar rats. A mechanistic pharmacodynamic (PD) model was developed based on the receptor/gene/protein-mediated GC effects on glucose regulation. Three major target organs (liver, white adipose tissue and skeletal muscle) together with some selected intermediate controlling factors were designated as important regulators involved in the pathogenesis of GC-induced glucose dysregulation. Assessed were dynamic changes of food intake and systemic factors (plasma glucose, insulin, free fatty acids (FFA) and leptin) and tissue-specific biomarkers (cAMP, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) mRNA and enzyme activity, leptin mRNA, interleukin 6 receptor type 1 (IL6R1) mRNA and Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) mRNA) after acute and chronic dosing with MPL along with the GC receptor (GR) dynamics in each target organ. Upon binding to GR in liver, MPL dosing caused increased glucose production by stimulating hepatic cAMP and PEPCK activity. In adipose tissue, the rise in leptin mRNA and plasma leptin caused reduction of food intake, the exogenous source of glucose input. Down-regulation of IRS-1 mRNA expression in skeletal muscle inhibited the stimulatory effect of insulin on glucose utilization further contributing to hyperglycemia. The nuclear drug-receptor complex served as the driving force for stimulation or inhibition of downstream target gene expression within different tissues. Incorporating information such as receptor dynamics, as well as the gene and protein induction, allowed us to describe the receptor-mediated effects of MPL on glucose regulation in each important tissue. This advanced mechanistic model provides unique insights into the contributions of major tissues and quantitative hypotheses for the multi-factor control of a complex metabolic system.",

    "abstract": "Polygonatum odoratum (Mill.) Druce belongs to the genus Polygonatum family of plants. In traditional Chinese medicine, the root of Polygonatum odoratum, Rhizoma Polygonati Odorati, is used both for food and medicine to prevent and treat metabolic disorders such as hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, obesity and cardiovascular disease. However, there is no solid experimental evidence to support these applications, and the underlying mechanism is also needed to be elucidated. Here, we examined the effect of the extract of Rhizoma Polygonati Odorati (ER) on metabolic disorders in diet-induced C57BL/6 obese mice. In the preventive experiment, the ER blocked body weight gain, and lowered serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and fasting blood glucose, improved glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT), reduced the levels of serum insulin and leptin, and increased serum adiponectin levels in mice fed with a high-fat diet significantly. In the therapeutic study, we induced obesity in the mice and treated the obese mice with ER for two weeks. We found that ER treatments reduced serum TG and fasting blood glucose, and improved glucose tolerance in the mice. Gene expression analysis showed that ER increased the mRNA levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) &#x3b3; and &#x3b1; and their downstream target genes in mice livers, adipose tissues and HepG2 cells. Our data suggest that ER ameliorates metabolic disorders and enhances the mRNA expression of PPARs in obese C57BL/6 mice induced by high-fat diet.",

    "abstract": "Leptin is essential for energy homeostasis and regulation of food intake. Patients with congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL) due to mutations in 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate-O-acyltransferase 2 (AGPAT2) and the CGL murine model (Agpat2(-/-) mice) both have severe insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, hepatic steatosis, and low plasma leptin levels. In this study, we show that continuous leptin treatment of Agpat2(-/-) mice for 28 days reduced plasma insulin and glucose levels and normalized hepatic steatosis and hypertriglyceridemia. Leptin also partially, but significantly, reversed the low plasma thyroxine and high corticosterone levels found in Agpat2(-/-) mice. Levels of carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) were reduced, whereas lipogenic gene expression were increased in the livers of Agpat2(-/-) mice, suggesting that deregulated ChREBP contributed to the development of fatty livers in these mice and that this transcription factor is a target of leptin's beneficial metabolic action. Leptin administration did not change hepatic fatty acid oxidation enzymes mRNA levels in Agpat2(-/-) mice. The selective deletion of leptin receptors only in hepatocytes did not prevent the positive metabolic actions of leptin in Agpat2(-/-) mice, supporting the notion that the majority of metabolic actions of leptin are dependent on its action in nonhepatocyte cells and/or the central nervous system.",

    "abstract": "The objective of our work was to evaluate the effect of sertraline hydrochloride on serum levels of leptin and sexual function in patients with premature ejaculation (PE). A total of 124 patients with a history of PE at least 6 months, aged 20-50 years, were treated with sertraline hydrochloride. One hundred and four age-matched normal males without a history of PE were included control subjects and were untreated. Before and after the 8 week experiment, sexual performance parameters including the intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) and the Chinese premature ejaculation index (CIPE) were collected from both PE patients and control subjects through a questionnaire survey and analyzed. Serum levels of leptin were measured. Correlations of serum leptin with Body Mass Index (BMI) were analyzed. Before sertraline treatment, serum levels of leptin were significantly higher (32.9 vs 8.8 &#x3bc;g/L, p&lt;0.001) but IELT and CIPE score were significantly lower (54 vs 590, p &lt;0.001; 8.7 vs 22.3, p &lt;0.0001) in PE patients than control subjects. After 8 weeks of treatment with sertraline, serum levels of leptinl in PE patients were decreased markedly to 8.0 &#x3bc;g/L, which was not significantly different from the levels in control subjects (p &gt;0.05); and IELT and CIPE score in PE patients were increased to the values similar to those in control subjects. The sensitivity and specificity values were 87.5% and 96.3% for leptin as a diagnosis target. These observations suggest sertraline as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor may offer an effective option for treating premature ejaculation.",

    "abstract": "Resistant hypertension (RHTN) includes patients with controlled blood pressure (BP) (CRHTN) and uncontrolled BP (UCRHTN). In fact, RHTN patients are more likely to have target organ damage (TOD), and resistin, leptin and adiponectin may affect BP control in these subjects. We assessed the relationship between adipokines levels and arterial stiffness, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and microalbuminuria (MA). This cross-sectional study included CRHTN (n=51) and UCRHTN (n=38) patients for evaluating body mass index, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, plasma adiponectin, leptin and resistin concentrations, pulse wave velocity (PWV), MA and echocardiography. Leptin and resistin levels were higher in UCRHTN, whereas adiponectin levels were lower in this same subgroup. Similarly, arterial stiffness, LVH and MA were higher in UCRHTN subgroup. Adiponectin levels negatively correlated with PWV (r=-0.42, P&lt;0.01), and MA (r=-0.48, P&lt;0.01) only in UCRHTN. Leptin was positively correlated with PWV (r=0.37, P=0.02) in UCRHTN subgroup, whereas resistin was not correlated with TOD in both subgroups. Adiponectin is associated with arterial stiffness and renal injury in UCRHTN patients, whereas leptin is associated with arterial stiffness in the same subgroup. Taken together, our results showed that those adipokines may contribute to vascular and renal damage in UCRHTN patients.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin is an anti-inflammatory adipocytokine believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic heart failure (CHF). We aimed to characterize the expression of adiponectin and its receptors in CHF and to assess the impact of microRNAs on the cardiac adiponectin system. Expression of adiponectin and adiponectin receptors (ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2) was studied by qPCR and immunohistochemistry in myocardial tissues of patients with end-stage CHF and control subjects. MicroRNA binding was evaluated by cloning of an ADIPOR2 3&#xb4;-untranslated-region reporter construct and subsequent transfection experiments. Effects of miRNA transfection were analyzed in cardiomyocyte cell cultures by qPCR and Western blotting. Gene silencing of ADIPOR2 was performed by siRNA transfection, and the effects of hypoxia/serum starvation were analyzed by flow cytometry. Although CHF patients displayed elevated plasma adiponectin levels, myocardial adiponectin expression generally was very low. In CHF, cardiac ADIPOR1 expression increased by &gt;4-fold, whereas the increase in ADIPOR2 was less than 2-fold. Reporter gene assays on constructs containing the ADIPOR2-3'-untranslated region suggest that microRNA-150 specifically repressed ADIPOR2 expression. Transfection of cardiomyocytes with premiR-150 precursor molecules resulted in 60% down-regulation of ADIPOR2 mRNA and a significant reduction of ADIPOR2 protein expression. MicroRNA-150 was substantially expressed in both normal and CHF myocardium, with a 1.7-fold higher expression in CHF. Finally, knock-down experiments elucidated a stress-protective role of ADIPOR2 in cardiomyocytes. MicroRNA-150 counteracts ADIPOR2 up-regulation in CHF and thus may contribute to adiponectin resistance. Targeting microRNA-150 may be a future strategy to restore cardioprotective adiponectin effects.",

    "title": "Role of adipokines and cytokines in obesity-associated breast cancer: therapeutic targets.",
    "abstract": "Obesity is the cause of a large proportion of breast cancer incidences and mortality in post-menopausal women. In obese people, elevated levels of various growth factors such as insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are found. Elevated insulin level leads to increased secretion of estrogen by binding to the circulating sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). The increased estrogen-mediated downstream signaling favors breast carcinogenesis. Obesity leads to altered expression profiles of various adipokines and cytokines including leptin, adiponectin, IL-6, TNF-&#x3b1; and IL-1&#x3b2;. The increased levels of leptin and decreased adiponectin secretion are directly associated with breast cancer development. Increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines within the tumor microenvironment promote tumor development. Efficacy of available breast cancer drugs against obesity-associated breast cancer is yet to be confirmed. In this review, we will discuss different adipokine- and cytokine-mediated molecular signaling pathways involved in obesity-associated breast cancer, available therapeutic strategies and potential therapeutic targets for obesity-associated breast cancer.",

    "title": "Metformin inhibits skin tumor promotion in overweight and obese mice.",
    "abstract": "In the present study, the ability of metformin to inhibit skin tumor promotion by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) was analyzed in mice maintained on either an overweight control diet or an obesity-inducing diet. Rapamycin was included for comparison, and a combination of metformin and rapamycin was also evaluated. Metformin (given in the drinking water) and rapamycin (given topically) inhibited development of both papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas in overweight and obese mice in a dose-dependent manner. A low-dose combination of these two compounds displayed an additive inhibitory effect on tumor development. Metformin treatment also reduced the size of papillomas. Interestingly, all treatments seemed to be at least as effective for inhibiting tumor formation in obese mice, and both metformin and rapamycin were more effective at reducing tumor size in obese mice compared with overweight control mice. The effect of metformin on skin tumor development was associated with a significant reduction in TPA-induced epidermal hyperproliferation. Furthermore, treatment with metformin led to activation of epidermal AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and attenuated signaling through mTOR complex (mTORC)-1 and p70S6K. Combinations of metformin and rapamycin were more effective at blocking epidermal mTORC1 signaling induced by TPA consistent with the greater inhibitory effect on skin tumor promotion. Collectively, the current data demonstrate that metformin given in the drinking water effectively inhibited skin tumor promotion in both overweight and obese mice and that the mechanism involves activation of epidermal AMPK and attenuated signaling downstream of mTORC1.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin is a protein hormone secreted exclusively by adipocytes that plays an important role in the modulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. In the present study, we investigated the ability of adiponectin to stimulate chicken preadipocyte differentiation and its effect on cellular signaling pathways associated with adipocyte differentiation. Data showed that over-expression of adiponectin inhibited adipocyte differentiation and the expression of adipogenic marker gene, while activated the expression of lipolytic marker gene. Meanwhile, adiponectin led to activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK)/activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2) signaling pathway and down-regulation of target of rapamycin (TOR)/p70 S6 Kinase signaling pathway. Furthermore, the activation of p38 MAPK/ATF-2 signaling pathway was blocked by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB253580, whereas adiponectin had a synergistic effect on the suppression of TOR/p70 S6 Kinase signaling pathway with the TOR inhibitor rapamycin. In conclusion, the results demonstrate the ability of adiponectin to inhibit chicken preadipocyte differentiation, which depends on the p38 MAPK/ATF-2 and TOR/p70 S6 Kinase pathways.",

    "title": "Leptin and the OB-receptor as anti-obesity target: recent in silico advances in the comprehension of the protein-protein interaction and rational drug design of anti- obesity lead compounds.",
    "abstract": "The OB-receptor or leptin receptor (LR) is crucial for energy homeostasis and regulation of food uptake. Leptin is a 16 kDa hormone that is mainly secreted by fat cells into the bloodstream. Under normal circumstances, circulating leptin levels are proportionate to the fat body mass. Sensing of elevated leptin levels by the hypothalamic neuro-circuitry activates a negative feedback loop resulting in reduced food intake and increased energy expenditure. Decreased leptin concentrations lead to opposite effects. Therefore, rational design of leptin agonists/antagonists could be an appealing challenge in the battle against obesity. The Leptin/LR interactions have been studied in several works by means of different molecular modelling approaches, spreading from homology modelling to manual docking. No small molecules have ever been proposed as agonists of the Ob receptor but researchers' efforts focused only on leptin-related synthetic peptides as receptor antagonists and on peptidomimetics. In this review we try to track a timeline of obtained in silico information to clarify the mechanism of interaction between leptin and its receptor, together to summarize the more recent efforts to propose new drugs usable in anti-obesity therapy. Final considerations could be useful starting points for the rational drug design of new lead compounds.",

    "title": "Mechanisms of Adipocytokine-Mediated Trastuzumab Resistance in HER2-Positive Breast Cancer Cell Lines.",
    "abstract": "Acquired resistance to trastuzumab is a clinical problem in the treatment of HER2-over-expressing metastatic breast cancer. Importantly, an earlier report suggested that high body mass index was associated with reduced overall survival and reduced time to progression in patients with early stage or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer treated with trastuzumab. Adipocyte-secreted factors may stimulate growth of HER2-positive cancers, blocking the growth inhibitory action of trastuzumab. Leptin and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) are two adipocytokines that have been reported to stimulate HER2-PI3K signaling. We previously showed that cells with acquired trastuzumab resistance express increased levels of GDF15, and that GDF15 knockdown restores sensitivity to trastuzumab. The objective of the current study was to identify potential molecular mechanisms by which adipocytes stimulate resistance to trastuzumab in HER2-over-expressing breast cancer cell lines. Cells were cultured in complete media or conditioned media from differentiated adipocytes (CM). Cell viability of trastuzumab-treated cells was examined under anchorage-dependent and -independent conditions. Phosphorylation of Akt was assessed by Western blotting, and response to trastuzumab was reassessed upon treatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or after transfection with kinase-dead Akt. We report that CM significantly reduced trastuzumab-mediated growth inhibition of HER2-positive cells, and stimulated rapid phosphorylation of Akt. Pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of PI3K overcame CM-mediated trastuzumab resistance. Leptin and GDF15 were both measured in CM, but only GDF15 conferred resistance to trastuzumab. Leptin, on the other hand, abrogated sensitivity to lapatinib but not trastuzumab. Our observations suggest that adipocyte-secreted factors such as GDF15 stimulate PI3K signaling, resulting in reduced response to trastuzumab. The utility of adipocytokines as predictors of drug resistance and approaches to mitigate the cancer-promoting effects of adipocyte-secreted factors should be further examined. Our work supports additional investigation into GDF15 as a potential biomarker of trastuzumab resistance, and development of approaches to therapeutically target GDF15 in HER2-positive breast cancers that have progressed on trastuzumab.",

    "abstract": "Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), catalyzing the conversion of Angiotensin II to Angiotensin 1-7. Apelin is a second catalytic substrate for ACE2 and functions as an inotropic and cardioprotective peptide. While an antagonistic relationship between the RAS and apelin has been proposed, such functional interplay remains elusive. Here we found that ACE2 was downregulated in apelin-deficient mice. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) rescued the impaired contractility and hypertrophy of apelin mutant mice, which was accompanied by restored ACE2 levels. Importantly, treatment with angiotensin 1-7 rescued hypertrophy and heart dysfunctions of apelin-knockout mice. Moreover, apelin, via activation of its receptor, APJ, increased ACE2 promoter activity in vitro and upregulated ACE2 expression in failing hearts in vivo. Apelin treatment also increased cardiac contractility and ACE2 levels in AT1R-deficient mice. These data demonstrate that ACE2 couples the RAS to the apelin system, adding a conceptual framework for the apelin-ACE2-angiotensin 1-7 axis as a therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "Cyclolepis genistoides D. Don is a herbaceous perennial belonging to the family Asteraceae, and its vernacular name is palo azul (palo). Palo has been reported to exhibit many physiological effects that contribute to the prevention of metabolic syndromes, although its mechanism is unclear. Among palo's various activities, we investigated the hypothesis that palo promotes adipocytes differentiation and regulates adipokine profiles in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by modulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) &#x3b3;, a major regulator of adipose differentiation. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were cultured and differentiated in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium with 50 to 200 &#x3bc;g/mL palo for 7 days or were cultured with palo without differentiation protocol for 14 days. Palo down-regulated the expression of 2 types of expressed/secreted adipokines, leptin and resistin, in a concentration-dependent manner. Under a nondifferentiated condition, palo promoted the accumulation of lipid droplets in cells. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and luciferase reporter assay showed that palo up-regulated expression and transcriptional activity of PPAR&#x3b3;. Furthermore, palo increased the expression of insulin-sensitizing adipokine, adiponectin, which is a directly target of PPAR&#x3b3;, both at the messenger RNA level and at the protein level. In summary, palo demonstrated the potential to improve insulin resistance by promoting adipocyte differentiation via PPAR&#x3b3; activation. Results suggest an increase in adiponectin secretion and a decrease in insulin-resistant factors such as leptin and resistin.",

    "title": "Could signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 be a therapeutic target in obesity-related gastrointestinal malignancy?",
    "abstract": "A large body of evidence has implicated the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family and particularly the ubiquitously expressed STAT3 protein in the pathogenesis of colorectal, hepatocellular, gastric and pancreatic carcinoma. Concomitantly, an increasing body of epidemiological evidence has linked obesity and its associated pro-inflammatory state with the development of gastrointestinal cancers. Visceral adipose tissue is no longer considered inert and is known to secrete a number of adipocytokines such as leptin, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-1&#x3b2; and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#x3b1;) into the surrounding environment. Interestingly, these adipocytokines are strongly linked with the Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT pathway of signal transduction and there is experimental evidence linking IL-1&#x3b2;, IL-8 and TNF-&#x3b1; to JAK/STAT signaling in other tissues. The result is an up-regulation of a wide range of anti-apoptotic, pro-metastatic and pro-angiogenic genes and processes. This is particularly relevant for gastrointestinal malignancy as these factors have the potential to signal adjacent endothelial cells in a paracrine manner. This review examines the potential role of the STAT3 signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of obesity-related gastrointestinal malignancy and the potential therapeutic role of STAT3 blockade given its status as a signaling hub for a number of inflammatory adipocytokines.",

Leptin plays a role in glioma invasion, however, whether and how leptin contributes to the biological properties of glioma stem-like cells, such as invasion, remains to be explored. In the current study, we aimed to explore the role of leptin during glioma stem-like cells invasion as well as the signaling pathway. We found that glioma stem-like cells exhibited high invasive potential, especially in the presence of leptin, Ob-R coexpressed with CD133 in glioma stem-like cells was showed to be responsible for leptin mediated invasion of glioma stem-like cells. Our results indicated that leptin served as a key intermediary linking the accumulation of excess adipokine to the invasion of glioma stem-like cells, which may be a novel therapeutic target for suppressing tumor invasion and recurrence.",

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common cause of musculoskeletal disability and pain in the world. The current drug treatment for OA is symptom relieving, and there is an urgent need for treatments that could retard, prevent or repair cartilage destruction in OA. Obesity is a major risk factor for OA. Traditionally, it has been thought to contribute to the development of OA by increasing the load on weight-bearing joints. However, this appears to be an over-simplification, because obesity is also linked to OA in the hand and finger joints. Recent studies have shown that adipocytokine leptin is a possible link between obesity and OA: Leptin levels in synovial fluid are increased in obese patients, leptin receptor (Ob-R) is expressed in cartilage, and leptin induces the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), pro-inflammatory mediators and nitric oxide (NO) in chondrocytes. Furthermore, according to the very recent findings, not only leptin levels in the joint but also leptin sensitivity in the cartilage are enhanced in obese OA patients. The findings supporting leptin as a causative link between obesity and OA offer leptin as a potential target to the development of disease-modifying drugs for osteoarthritis (DMOAD), especially for obese patients.",

    "title": "Hypothalamic WNT signalling is impaired during obesity and reinstated by leptin treatment in male mice.",
    "abstract": "The WNT pathway has been well characterized in embryogenesis and tumorigenesis. In humans, specific polymorphisms in the T cell-specific transcription factor 7 and the WNT coreceptor, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-6 (LRP-6), both prominent components of this pathway, correlate with a higher incidence of type 2 diabetes, suggesting that the WNT pathway might be involved in the control of adult glucose homeostasis. We previously demonstrated that glycogen-synthase-kinase-3&#x3b2; (GSK-3&#x3b2;), the key enzyme of the WNT pathway, is increased in the hypothalamus during obesity and exacerbates high-fat diet-induced weight gain as well as glucose intolerance. These data suggest that WNT action in the hypothalamus might be required for normal glucose homeostasis. Here we characterized whether WNT signaling in general is altered in the hypothalamus of adult obese mice relative to controls. First we identified expression of multiple components of this pathway in the murine arcuate nucleus by in situ hybridization. In this region mRNA of ligands and target genes of the WNT pathway were down-regulated in obese and glucose-intolerant leptin-deficient mice. Similarly, the number of cells immunoreactive for the phosphorylated (active) form of the WNT-coreceptor LRP-6 was also decreased in leptin-deficient mice. Leptin treatment normalized expression of the WNT-target genes Axin-2 and Cylin-D1 and increased the number of phospho-LRP-6-immunoreactive cells reaching levels of lean controls. Leptin also increased the levels of phosphorylated (inactive) GSK-3&#x3b2; in the arcuate nucleus, and this effect was colocalized to neuropeptide Y neurons, suggesting that inactivation of GSK-3&#x3b2; may contribute to the neuroendocrine control of energy homeostasis. Taken together our findings identify hypothalamic WNT signaling as an important novel pathway that integrates peripheral information of the body's energy status encoded by leptin.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin, a hormone produced from adipose tissue, regulates various biological responses, including inflammation and many metabolic processes. MicroRNAs control expression of diverse target genes and various physiological responses. Many of these responses are commonly regulated by adiponectin. However, effects of adiponectin on microRNAs regulation are largely unknown. Herein we demonstrated that globular adiponectin induces increase in miR-155 expression, which plays an important role in inflammatory response, in RAW 264.7 macrophages. We further showed that this effect was modulated by and MAPK/NF-&#x3ba;B dependent mechanisms. These results suggest that miR-155 would be a novel promising target mediating adiponectin-induced various biological responses.",

    "title": "Adiponectin offers protection against L166P mutant DJ-1-induced neuronal cytotoxicity mediated by APPL1-dependent AMPK activation.",
    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the world. L166P mutant DJ-1 has been linked with a genetic form of the disease. Preventing neurotoxicity of DJ-1 familial mutations has become a new therapeutic target for PD. Adiponectin, the most abundantly secreted adipokine, has displayed its protective roles in pathologies of various types of diseases. In this study, we investigate whether adiponectin is protective against neurotoxicity induced by familial L166P mutant DJ-1 in PD. Our results demonstrate that adiponectin treatment could attenuate increased levels of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide induced by the DJ-1L166P mutation. In addition, adiponectin could rescue impaired mitochondrial membrane potential induced by DJ-1L166P. Importantly, we verified that both adiponectin receptors, type 1 (AdipoR1) and type 2 (AdipoR2), are expressed in human neuroblastoma M17 cells. Our results also demonstrate that the protective effects of adiponectin against DJ-1L166P-induced neuronal cytotoxicity under 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+) treatment require binding of adiponectin to its cell surface receptors. Finally, we found that the protective effects of adiponectin against DJ-1L166P depend on AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation mediated by the endosomal adaptor protein, APPL1 (adaptor protein with phosphotyrosine binding, pleckstrin homology domains and leucine zipper motif). These data suggest that adiponectin may have potential for implementation in novel therapies against PD.",

    "abstract": "Leptin plays a pathophysiological role in the kidney, however, its acute effects on the proximal tubule cells (PTCs) are unknown. In opossum kidney (OK) cells in vitro, Western blot analysis identified that exposure to leptin increases the phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p44/42 and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Importantly leptin (0.05, 0.10, 0.25 and 0.50 &#x3bc;g/ml) significantly reduced the metabolic activity of PTCs, and significantly decreased protein content per cell. Investigation of the role of p44/42 and mTOR on metabolic activity and protein content per cell, demonstrated that in the presence of MAPK inhibitor U0126 and mTOR inhibitor Ku-63794, that the mTOR pathway is responsible for the reduction in PTC metabolic activity in response to leptin. However, p44/42 and mTOR play no role the reduced protein content per cell in OKs exposed to leptin. Therefore, leptin modulates metabolic activity in PTCs via an mTOR regulated pathway.",

    "title": "Leptin as a neuroprotective agent in glaucoma.",
    "abstract": "Glaucoma is a disease characterized by progressive optic nerve degeneration and is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. More than 60 million people globally are affected by glaucoma, of which 8 million people suffer from bilateral blindness, making glaucoma the second leading cause of bilateral blindness worldwide. Current management of glaucoma is aimed at reducing intraocular pressure via a number of different strategies. Current treatments do not attempt to correct the underlying pathology of glaucoma, which is the cell degeneration and ultimate death of retinal ganglion cells, thereby limiting their clinical efficacy. A neuroprotective approach to glaucoma management would address the underlying pathology and would, in theory, be beneficial to all patients regardless of risk and causative factors. Here it is proposed that leptin could be used as a potential neuroprotective agent in the management of glaucoma. Leptin has shown neuroprotective promise in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, and there has been increasing evidence that glaucomatous neurodegeneration is analogous to other neurodegenerative diseases in the central nervous system. Leptin could target retinal ganglion cell death by a number of mechanisms, namely apoptosis, oxidative stress and excitotoxicity reduction. This article presents evidence linking current understanding about leptin's neuroprotective effect and the molecular mechanisms underlying glaucoma.",

    "abstract": "The cytoplasmic regulatory protein p62 (Sequestosome 1/A170) is known to modulate various receptor-mediated intracellular signaling pathways. p62 deficiency was shown to result in mature-onset obesity in mice, but the mechanisms underlying this abnormality remained unclear. Here we report that hyperphagia due to central leptin resistance is the cause of obesity in p62(-/-) mice. We found that these mice show hyperphagia. Restriction of food to the amount eaten by wild-type mice prevented excess body weight gain and fat accumulation, suggesting that overfeeding is the primary cause of obesity in p62(-/-) mice. Brain-specific p62 deficiency caused mature-onset obesity to the same extent as in p62(-/-) mice, further supporting a neuronal mechanism as the major cause of obesity in these mice. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that p62 is highly expressed in hypothalamic neurons, including POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus. Central leptin resistance was observed even in young preobese p62(-/-) mice. We found a defect in intracellular distribution of the transcription factor Stat3, which is essential for the action of leptin, in p62(-/-) mice. These results indicate that brain p62 plays an important role in bodyweight control by modulating the central leptin-signaling pathway and that lack of p62 in the brain causes leptin resistance, leading to hyperphagia. Thus, p62 could be a clinical target for treating obesity and metabolic syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin (Ad) plays a crucial role in hepatic lipid metabolism. However, the regulating mechanism of hepatic lipid metabolism by Ad in dairy cows is unclear. Hepatocytes from a newborn female calf were cultured in vitro and treated with different concentrations of Ad and BML-275 (an AMPK&#x3b1; inhibitor).

Furthermore, the phosphorylation and activity of AMPK&#x3b1;, as well as the expression levels and transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-&#x3b1; (PPAR&#x3b1;) and its target genes involved in lipid oxidation, showed a corresponding trend of upregulation. However, the expression levels and transcriptional activity of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) and carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) decreased in a similar manner. When BML-275 was added, the p-AMPK&#x3b1; level as well as the expression and activity of PPAR&#x3b1; and its target genes were significantly decreased. However, the expression levels of SREBP-1c, ChREBP and their target genes showed a trend of upregulation. Furthermore, the triglyceride (TG) content was significantly decreased in the Ad-treated groups. These results indicate that Ad activates the AMPK signaling pathway and mediates lipid metabolism in bovine hepatocytes cultured in vitro by promoting lipid oxidation, suppressing lipid synthesis and reducing hepatic lipid accumulation.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the effect of piperine on hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance induced in mice by feeding a high-fat diet (HFD) for 13 weeks and elucidated potential underlying molecular mechanisms. Administration of piperine (50 mg/kg body weight) to mice with HFD-induced hepatic steatosis resulted in a significant increase in plasma adiponectin levels. Also, elevated plasma concentrations of insulin and glucose and hepatic lipid levels induced by feeding a HFD were reversed in mice when they were administered piperine. However, piperine did not reduce body weight and other biochemical markers to an extent where they became equal to the levels found in the CD-fed mice. Piperine reversed HFD-induced down-regulation of adiponecitn-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signalling molecules which play an important role in mediating lipogenesis, fatty acid oxidation and insulin signalling in the livers of mice. The expressions of lipogenic target genes were decreased, whereas the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) gene involved in fatty acid oxidation was increased in the livers of the Pin50 group. Piperine significantly decreased the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) compared with the HFD-fed mice. Administration of piperine appeared to reverse preexisting HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance, probably by activation of adiponectin-AMPK signalling in mice.",

    "abstract": "TNF&#x3b1; plays an important role in the adipocyte dysfunction, including lipolysis acceleration, insulin resistance and changes of adipokines. Recently, we showed that paeoniflorin attenuates adipocyte lipolysis and inhibits the phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, IKK stimulated by TNF&#x3b1;. However, the effects of paeoniflorin on adipocytes insulin resistance and changes of adipokines remain unknown. The aim of the current study was to investigate the role of paeoniflorin in preventing insulin resistance or inflammation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with TNF&#x3b1;. Our results showed that paeoniflorin restored insulin-stimulated [(3)H]2-DOG uptake, which was reduced by TNF&#x3b1;, with concomitant restoration in serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of AKT in adipocytes. Paeoniflorin attenuated TNF&#x3b1;-mediated suppression of the expressions of PPAR&#x3b3; and PPAR&#x3b3; target genes, and the improvement of paeoniflorin on TNF&#x3b1;-induced insulin resistance was attenuated by GW9662, an antagonist of PPAR&#x3b3; activity. Moreover, paeoniflorin could inhibit the expressions and secretions of IL-6 and MCP-1 from adipocytes induced by TNF&#x3b1;. These results, together with our previous data, indicate that paeoniflorin exerts a beneficial effect on adipocytes to prevent TNF&#x3b1;-induced insulin resistance and inflammatory adipokine release. Our studies provide important evidence for an ability of paeoniflorin in amelioration of TNF&#x3b1;-induced adipocyte dysfunction, which would be helpful to clarify its potential role in the treatment of obesity.",

    "abstract": "Elevated levels of systemic and pulmonary leptin are associated with diseases related to lung injury and lung cancer. However, the role of leptin in lung biology and pathology, including the mechanism of leptin gene expression in the pathogenesis of lung diseases, including lung cancer, remains elusive. Here, using conditional deletion of tumor suppressor gene Pten in the lung epithelium in vivo in transgenic mice and human PTEN-null lung epithelial cells, we identify the leptin-driven feed-forward signaling loop in the lung epithelial cells. Leptin-mediated leptin/leptin-receptor gene expression likely amplifies leptin signaling that may contribute to the pathogenesis and severity of lung diseases, resulting in poor clinical outcomes. Loss of Pten in the lung epithelial cells in vivo activated adipokine signaling and induced leptin synthesis as ascertained by genome-wide mRNA profiling and pathway analysis. Leptin gene transcription was mediated by binding of transcription factors NRF-1 and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein &#x3b4; (C/EBP) to the proximal promoter regions and STAT3 to the distal promoter regions as revealed by leptin promoter-mutation, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and gain- and loss-of-function studies in lung epithelial cells. Leptin treatment induced expression of the leptin/leptin receptor in the lung epithelial cells via activation of MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways. Expression of constitutively active MEK-1, AKT, and STAT3 proteins increased expression, and treatment with MEK, PI3K, AKT, and mTOR inhibitors decreased LEP expression, indicating that leptin via MAPK/ERK1/2, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and JAK2/STAT3 pathways, in turn, further induces its own gene expression. Thus, targeted inhibition of the leptin-mediated feed-forward loop provides a novel rationale for pharmacotherapy of disease associated with lung injury and remodeling, including lung cancer.",

    "abstract": "Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) counteracts leptin signaling and is a therapeutic target for obesity and diabetes. Here we found that LIM domain only 4 (LMO4) inhibits PTP1B activity by increasing the oxidized inactive form of PTP1B. Mice with neuronal ablation of LMO4 have elevated PTP1B activity and impaired hypothalamic leptin signaling, and a PTP1B inhibitor normalized PTP1B activity and restored leptin control of circulating insulin levels. LMO4 is palmitoylated at its C-terminal cysteine, and deletion of this residue prevented palmitoylation and retention of LMO4 at the endoplasmic reticulum and abolished its inhibitory effect on PTP1B. Importantly, LMO4 palmitoylation is sensitive to metabolic stress; mice challenged with a brief high-fat diet or acute intracerebroventricular infusion of saturated fatty acid had less palmitoylated LMO4, less oxidized PTP1B, and increased PTP1B activity in the hypothalamus. Thus, unleashed PTP1B activity attributable to loss of LMO4 palmitoylation may account for rapid loss of central leptin signaling after acute exposure to saturated fat.",

    "title": "Combined CpG and poly I:C stimulation of monocytes results in unique signaling activation not observed with the individual ligands.",
    "abstract": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) bind to components of microbes, activate cellular signal transduction pathways and stimulate innate immune responses. Previously, we have shown in chicken monocytes that the combination of CpG, the ligand for TLR21 (the chicken equivalent of TLR9), and poly I:C, the ligand for TLR3, results in a synergistic immune response. In order to further characterize this synergy, kinome analysis was performed on chicken monocytes stimulated with either unmethylated CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG) and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) individually or in combination for either 1h or 4h. The analysis was carried out using chicken species-specific peptide arrays to study the kinase activity induced by the two ligands. The arrays are comprised of kinase target sequences immobilized on an array surface. Active kinases phosphorylate their respective target sequences, and these phosphorylated peptides are then visualized and quantified. A significant number of peptides exhibited altered phosphorylation when CpG and poly I:C were given together, that was not observed when either CpG or poly I:C was given separately. The unique, synergistic TLR agonist affected peptides represent protein members of signaling pathways including calcium signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and Endocytosis at the 1h time point. At the 4h time point, TLR agonist synergy influenced pathways included Adipocytokine signaling pathway, cell cycle, calcium signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway and RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway. Using nitric oxide (NO) production as the readout, TLR ligand synergy was also investigated using signaling protein inhibitors. A number of inhibitors were able to inhibit NO response in cells given CpG alone but not in cells given both CpG and poly I:C, as poly I:C alone does not elicit a significant NO response. The unique peptide phosphorylation induced by the combination of CpG and poly I:C and the unique signaling protein requirements for synergy determined by inhibitor assays both show that synergistic signaling is not a simple addition of TLR pathways. A set of secondary pathways activated by the ligand combination are proposed, leading to the activation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), nuclear factor &#x3ba;B (NF&#x3ba;B) and ultimately of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Since many microbes can stimulate more than one TLR, this synergistic influence on cellular signaling may be an important consideration for the study of immune response and what we consider to be the canonical TLR signaling pathways.",

    "title": "Resistin impairs SIRT1 function and induces senescence-associated phenotype in hepatocytes.",
    "abstract": "Resistin is a cysteine-rich secreted protein which significantly inhibits phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase in both human and mouse hepatocytes. It has been demonstrated that resistin plays an important role in inducing hepatic insulin resistance. However, whether resistin has other unknown influences on hepatocytes still remains poorly studied. Here, we show that recombinant resistin protein significantly reduces expression of SIRT1, attenuates the interaction between SIRT1 and PPAR&#x3b1; as well as PGC-1&#x3b1;, and increases PGC-1&#x3b1; acetyl-lysine levels in HepG2 cells. In line with this, resistin treatment weakens the association between SIRT1 and major satellite repeats and alters the transcription level of SIRT1 target genes in mouse primary hepatocytes. Resistin treatment also significantly increases senescence-associated &#x3b2;-galactosidase activity in mouse primary hepatocytes and this effect can be eliminated by co-treatment with the SIRT1 agonists resveratrol and nicotinamide mononucleotide. Our findings suggest that resistin is a negative regulator of SIRT1 in both human hepatoma cell line HepG2 and mouse hepatocytes and that it might also play an important role in the development of senescence-associated liver diseases.",

    "abstract": "Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a novel metabolic regulator that represents a promising target for the treatment of several metabolic diseases. Administration of recombinant wild type FGF21 to diabetic animals leads to a dramatic improvement in glycaemia and ameliorates other systemic measures of metabolic health. Here we report the pharmacologic outcomes observed in non-human primates upon administration of a recently described FGF21 analogue, LY2405319 (LY). Diabetic rhesus monkeys were treated subcutaneously with LY once daily for a period of seven weeks. The doses of LY used were 3, 9 and 50 mg/kg each delivered in an escalating fashion with washout measurements taken at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks following the final LY dose. LY therapy led to a dramatic and rapid lowering of several important metabolic parameters including glucose, body weight, insulin, cholesterol and triglyceride levels at all doses tested. In addition, we observed favorable changes in circulating profiles of adipokines, with increased adiponectin and reduced leptin indicative of direct FGF21 action on adipose tissue. Importantly, and for the first time we show that FGF21 based therapy has metabolic efficacy in an animal with late stage diabetes. While the glycemic efficacy of LY in this animal was partially attenuated its lipid lowering effect was fully preserved suggesting that FGF21 may be a viable treatment option even in patients with advanced disease progression. These findings support continued exploration of the FGF21 pathway for the treatment of metabolic disease.",

    "title": "Leptin action in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus is sufficient, but not necessary, to normalize diabetic hyperglycemia.",
    "abstract": "In rodent models of type 1 diabetes, leptin administration into brain ventricles normalizes blood glucose at doses that have no effect when given peripherally. The ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMN) is a potential target for leptin's antidiabetic effects because leptin-sensitive neurons in this brain area are implicated in glucose homeostasis. To test this hypothesis, we injected leptin directly into the bilateral VMN of rats with streptozotocin-induced uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. This intervention completely normalized both hyperglycemia and the elevated rates of hepatic glucose production and plasma glucagon levels but had no effect on tissue glucose uptake in the skeletal muscle or brown adipose tissue as measured using tracer dilution techniques during a basal clamp. To determine whether VMN leptin signaling is required for leptin-mediated normalization of diabetic hyperglycemia, we studied mice in which the leptin receptor gene was deleted in VMN steroidogenic factor 1 neurons using cre-loxP technology. Our findings indicate leptin action within these neurons is not required for the correction of diabetic hyperglycemia by central leptin infusion. We conclude that leptin signaling in the VMN is sufficient to mediate leptin's antidiabetic action but may not be necessary for this effect. Leptin action within a distributed neuronal network may mediate its effects on glucose homeostasis.",

    "title": "Recombinant adiponectin ameliorates liver ischemia reperfusion injury via activating the AMPK/eNOS pathway.",
    "abstract": "It is of importance to minimize ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury during liver operations. Reducing the inflammatory reaction is an effective way to achieve this goal. Notably, adiponectin (APN) was found to have anti-inflammatory activity in heart and renal I/R injury. Herein, we investigated the role of APN in liver I/R injury. WISTAR RATS WERE RANDOMIZED TO FOUR GROUPS: (1) sham group; (2) I/R control group; (3) I/R+APN group; and (4) I/R+APN+AMPK inhibitor group. Liver and blood samples were collected 6h and 24h after reperfusion. Liver function and histopathologic changes were assessed. Macrophage and neutrophil infiltration was detected by immunohistochemistry staining, while pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines released in the liver were measured using ELISA and RT-PCR, respectively. Apoptosis was analyzed by TUNEL staining and caspase-3 expression in the liver. Downstream molecules of APN were investigated by Western blotting. Circulatory APN was down-regulated during liver I/R. When exogenous APN treatment was administered during liver I/R, alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were decreased, and less hepatocyte necrosis was observed. Less inflammatory cell infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines release were also observed in the I/R+APN group when compared with the I/R control group. APN treatment also reduced hepatocyte apoptosis, evidenced by reduced TUNEL positive cells and less caspase-3 expression in the reperfused liver. Finally, the AMPK/eNOS pathway was found to be activated by APN, and administration of an AMPK inhibitor reversed the beneficial effects of APN. APN can protect the liver from I/R injury by reducing the inflammatory response and hepatocyte apoptosis, a process that likely involves the AMPK/eNOS pathway. The current study provides a potential pharmacologic target for liver I/R injury.",

    "title": "Effects of AgRP inhibition on energy balance and metabolism in rodent models.",
    "abstract": "Activation of brain melanocortin-4 receptors (MC4-R) by &#x3b1;-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) or inhibition by agouti-related protein (AgRP) regulates food intake and energy expenditure and can modulate neuroendocrine responses to changes in energy balance. To examine the effects of AgRP inhibition on energy balance, a small molecule, non-peptide compound, TTP2515, developed by TransTech Pharma, Inc., was studied in vitro and in rodent models in vivo. TTP2515 prevented AgRP from antagonizing &#x3b1;-MSH-induced increases in cAMP in HEK 293 cells overexpressing the human MC4-R. When administered to rats by oral gavage TTP2515 blocked icv AgRP-induced increases in food intake, weight gain and adiposity and suppression of T4 levels. In both diet-induced obese (DIO) and leptin-deficient mice, TTP2515 decreased food intake, weight gain, adiposity and respiratory quotient. TTP2515 potently suppressed food intake and weight gain in lean mice immediately after initiation of a high fat diet (HFD) but had no effect on these parameters in lean chow-fed mice. However, when tested in AgRP KO mice, TTP2515 also suppressed food intake and weight gain during HFD feeding. In several studies TTP2515 increased T4 but not T3 levels, however this was also observed in AgRP KO mice. TTP2515 also attenuated refeeding and weight gain after fasting, an effect not evident in AgRP KO mice when administered at moderate doses. This study shows that TTP2515 exerts many effects consistent with AgRP inhibition however experiments in AgRP KO mice indicate some off-target effects of this drug. TTP2515 was particularly effective during fasting and in mice with leptin deficiency, conditions in which AgRP is elevated, as well as during acute and chronic HFD feeding. Thus the usefulness of this drug in treating obesity deserves further exploration, to define the AgRP dependent and independent mechanisms by which TTP2515 exerts its effects on energy balance.",

    "title": "Transactivation of ErbB receptors by leptin in the cardiovascular system: mechanisms, consequences and target for therapy.",
    "abstract": "Many experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated leptin concentration in patients with obesity/metabolic syndrome contributes to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disorders including arterial hypertension, atherosclerosis, restenosis after coronary angioplasty and myocardial hypertrophy. Receptor tyrosine kinases belonging to the ErbB family, especially ErbB1 (epidermal growth factor receptor) and ErbB2 are abundantly expressed in the blood vessels and the heart. EGFR is activated not only by its multiple peptide ligands but also by many other factors including angiotensin II, endothelin-1, norepinephrine, thrombin and prorenin; the phenomenon referred to as transactivation. Augmented EGFR signaling contributes to abnormalities of vascular tone and renal sodium handling as well as vascular remodeling and myocardial hypertrophy through various intracellular mechanisms, in particular extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Recent experimental studies indicate that chronically elevated leptin transactivates the EGFR through the mechanisms requiring reactive oxygen species and cytosolic tyrosine kinase, c-Src. In addition, hyperleptinemia increases ErbB2 activity in the arterial wall. Stimulation of EGFR and ErbB2 downstream signaling pathways such as ERK and PI3K in the vascular wall and the kidney may contribute to the increase in vascular tone, enhanced tubular sodium reabsorption as well as vascular and renal lesions in hyperleptinemic obese subjects.",

    "title": "Leptin-induced endothelial dysfunction: a target for therapeutic interventions.",
    "abstract": "Leptin has received much attention since its cloning in 1994. Initially, leptin research centered on satiety, energy balance and sympathetic activation. However, hyperleptinemia has since been identified as an independent risk factor for various cardiovascular pathologies including atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. Over the last decade, multiple studies have implicated leptin as an important mediator in endothelial dysfunction and neointimal hyperplasia, both key steps in the evolution of atherosclerotic vascular changes. Additionally, more recent evidence indicates that paracrine leptin release from perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) has deleterious effects on the underlying endothelium and vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC), including the coronary circulation. This report reviews pertinent literature on leptin-mediated endothelial dysfunction, SMC proliferation and the role of PVAT-derived leptin with an emphasis on the coronary circulation and discussions of currently proposed molecular mechanisms of PVAT-mediated coronary endothelial dysfunction and neointimal hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial dysfunction is associated with hypertension, atherosclerosis, and metabolic syndrome. Phycocyanin is a pigment found in the blue-green algae, Spirulina, which possesses antihypertensive effect. In this study, we hypothesized that phycocyanin derived from Spirulina exerts antihypertensive actions by improving endothelial dysfunction in metabolic syndrome. Spontaneously hypertensive/NIH-corpulent (SHR/NDmcr-cp) rats were divided into 4 groups then fed a normal diet with or without phycocyanin (2500-, 5000-, or 10,000-mg/kg diet) for 25 weeks. At 34 weeks of age, although systolic blood pressure was not significantly different among groups, phycocyanin-fed groups exhibited a dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure. Serum levels of adiponectin and messenger RNA levels of adiponectin and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein &#x3b1; in the adipose tissue of rats fed diets containing phycocyanin tended to be higher than those of rats fed a normal diet, but the differences were not statistically significant. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed a significant and positive correlation between aortic endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression levels, a downstream target of the adiponectin receptor, and serum adiponectin levels, although there were no significant differences in eNOS expression among groups. There was also no significant correlation between eNOS expression levels and systolic blood pressure. These results suggest that long-term administration of phycocyanin may ameliorate systemic blood pressure by enhancing eNOS expression in aorta that is stimulated by adiponectin. Phycocyanin may be beneficial for preventing endothelial dysfunction-related diseases in metabolic syndrome.",

    "title": "Inhibition of the mTOR pathway: a possible protective role in coronary artery disease.",
    "abstract": "The main approach to obesity and type-II diabetes is to unravel the mechanisms involved in nutrient absorption and fuel allocation. In conditions of over-nutrition, cells must cope with a multitude of extracellular signals generated by changes in nutrient load, hormonal milieu, adverse cytokine/adipokine profile, and apoptosis/anti-apoptosis processes. To date studies have demonstrate that among all nutrients, lipids and carbohydrates play a major regulatory role in the gene transcription of glycolytic and lipogenic enzymes, insulin, and adipokines. These nutrients mainly exert their effects through the gene expression of sterol responsive binding protein 1 and 2 (SREBP) and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Excess of adipose tissue is known to confer a significantly higher risk of coronary artery disease. Administration of rapamycin effectively attenuated inflammation, inhibited progression, and enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques in animal models. Herein we discuss the mTOR pathway and the molecular mechanisms of mTOR inhibitors, hypothesizing a possible protective role in atherosclerosis, taking into account also previous clinical studies emphasizing their opposite role.",

    "title": "Obesity-driven synaptic remodeling affects endocannabinoid control of orexinergic neurons.",
    "abstract": "Acute or chronic alterations in energy status alter the balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission and associated synaptic plasticity to allow for the adaptation of energy metabolism to new homeostatic requirements. The impact of such changes on endocannabinoid and cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1)-mediated modulation of synaptic transmission and strength is not known, despite the fact that this signaling system is an important target for the development of new drugs against obesity. We investigated whether CB1-expressing excitatory vs. inhibitory inputs to orexin-A-containing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus are altered in obesity and how this modifies endocannabinoid control of these neurons. In lean mice, these inputs are mostly excitatory. By confocal and ultrastructural microscopic analyses, we observed that in leptin-knockout (ob/ob) obese mice, and in mice with diet-induced obesity, orexinergic neurons receive predominantly inhibitory CB1-expressing inputs and overexpress the biosynthetic enzyme for the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol, which retrogradely inhibits synaptic transmission at CB1-expressing axon terminals. Patch-clamp recordings also showed increased CB1-sensitive inhibitory innervation of orexinergic neurons in ob/ob mice. These alterations are reversed by leptin administration, partly through activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway in neuropeptide-Y-ergic neurons of the arcuate nucleus, and are accompanied by CB1-mediated enhancement of orexinergic innervation of target brain areas. We propose that enhanced inhibitory control of orexin-A neurons, and their CB1-mediated disinhibition, are a consequence of leptin signaling impairment in the arcuate nucleus. We also provide initial evidence of the participation of this phenomenon in hyperphagia and hormonal dysregulation in obesity.",

    "title": "Leptin stimulates interleukin-6 production via janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 in rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts.",
    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the influence of leptin on the production of proinflammatory cytokines by rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts (RSFs). Synovial tissue was obtained from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Leptin receptor mRNAs were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Productions of mRNA and protein of interleukin (IL)-1&#x3b2;, tumour necrosis factor-&#x3b1; (TNF-&#x3b1;), and IL-6 in the culture medium were detected by real-time PCR and ELISA kit, respectively. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was transfected into RSF to down-regulate the expression of leptin receptor. Effects of inhibitors of janus kinase 2 (JAK2), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) on IL-6 production were evaluated. Phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in RSF were determined by Western blot analysis. We detected leptin receptor mRNAs in RSFs. Expression of IL-1&#x3b2; and IL-6 mRNA was enhanced in a concentration-dependent manner by addition of leptin to RSFs. IL-6 secretion by RSFs showed an increase after leptin stimulation. Leptin-induced production of IL-6 by RSFs was decreased after exposure to siRNA targeting leptin receptor (Ob-Rb). A JAK2 inhibitor, but not PI3K and MAPK inhibitors, decreased leptin-induced IL-6 production. Enhanced phosphorylation of STAT3 was observed in RSFs after stimulation by leptin. Leptin may be one of the proinflammatory cytokines that up-regulates IL-6 production in RSFs via activation of JAK2/STAT3. Leptin and JAK/STAT pathway may represent a new alternative therapeutic target in the treatment of RA.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNA-21 and programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), a downstream target of miR-21, mediate diverse physiological responses. Here we demonstrate that globular adiponectin (gAcrp) modulates expression of miR-21 and PDCD4 in RAW 264.7 macrophages. These effects were abrogated by inhibitors of ERK1/2, JNK or NF-&#x3ba;B. Conditioned media collected from gAcrp-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages caused similar effects as direct gAcrp treatment, showing the paracrine effect of gAcrp. These data indicate that gAcrp modulates the miR-21/PDCD4 axis through the ERK and JNK/NF-&#x3ba;B pathways in RAW 264.7 macrophages and further suggest that the miR-21/PDCD4 axis may be a novel target mediating adiponectin-induced biological responses.",

    "title": "Dietary iron overload induces visceral adipose tissue insulin resistance.",
    "abstract": "Increased iron stores associated with elevated levels of the iron hormone hepcidin are a frequent feature of the metabolic syndrome. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of dietary iron supplementation on insulin resistance and the role of hepcidin in C57Bl/6 male mice fed a standard or iron-enriched diet for 16 weeks. Iron supplementation increased hepatic iron and serum hepcidin fivefold and led to a 40% increase in fasting glucose due to insulin resistance, as confirmed by the insulin tolerance test, and to threefold higher levels of triglycerides. Iron supplemented mice had lower visceral adipose tissue mass estimated by epididymal fat pad, associated with iron accumulation in adipocytes. Decreased insulin signaling, evaluated by the phospho-Akt/Akt ratio, was detected in the visceral adipose tissue of iron overloaded mice, and gene expression analysis of visceral adipose tissue showed that an iron-enriched diet up-regulated iron-responsive genes and adipokines, favoring insulin resistance, whereas lipoprotein lipase was down-regulated. This resulted in hyperresistinemia and increased visceral adipose tissue expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (Socs3), a target of resistin and hepcidin implicated in insulin resistance. Acute hepcidin administration down-regulated lipoprotein lipase and up-regulated Socs3 in visceral adipose tissue. In conclusion, we characterized a model of dysmetabolic iron overload syndrome in which an iron-enriched diet induces insulin resistance and hypertriglyceridemia and affects visceral adipose tissue metabolism by a mechanism involving hepcidin up-regulation.",

    "title": "Expression of the apelin-APJ pathway and effects on erectile function in a mouse model of vasculogenic erectile dysfunction.",
    "abstract": "Much attention has recently been focused on therapeutic angiogenesis as a treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED). The apelin and apelin receptor (APJ) system is known to cause endothelium-dependent vasodilatation and to be involved in angiogenesis. To examine the differential expression of apelin and APJ in animal models of vasculogenic ED and to determine whether and how enhancement of apelin-APJ signaling restores erectile function in hypercholesterolemic mice. Acute cavernous ischemia was induced in C57BL/6J mice by bilateral occlusion of internal iliac arteries, and chronic vasculogenic ED was induced by feeding a high-cholesterol diet or by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of apelin and APJ were determined in cavernous tissue of each vasculogenic ED model by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We evaluated erectile function by electrical stimulation of the cavernous nerve in hypercholesterolemic mice 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after a single intracavernous injection of apelin protein (5 &#x3bc;g/20 &#x3bc;L). The penis was harvested for histologic examinations and Western blot analysis. The cavernous mRNA expression of apelin and APJ was up-regulated in acute ischemia model and down-regulated in chronic vasculogenic ED models. A significant restoration of erectile function was noted 1 day after injection of apelin protein into the penis of hypercholesterolemic mice; however, erectile function returned to baseline values thereafter. The beneficial effects of apelin on erectile function resulted mainly from an activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and increase in nitric oxide bioavailability through reduction in reactive oxygen species-mediated endothelial apoptosis rather than through direct endothelial cell proliferation. These findings suggest that apelin-APJ signaling is a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of vasculogenic ED. Further studies are needed to develop a potent agonist for APJ and to determine the role of repeated dosing of apelin on long-term recovery of erectile function.",

    "title": "cAMP-responsive element binding protein: a vital link in embryonic hormonal adaptation.",
    "abstract": "The transcription factor cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB) and activating transcription factors (ATFs) are downstream components of the insulin/IGF cascade, playing crucial roles in maintaining cell viability and embryo survival. One of the CREB target genes is adiponectin, which acts synergistically with insulin. We have studied the CREB-ATF-adiponectin network in rabbit preimplantation development in vivo and in vitro. From the blastocyst stage onwards, CREB and ATF1, ATF3, and ATF4 are present with increasing expression for CREB, ATF1, and ATF3 during gastrulation and with a dominant expression in the embryoblast (EB). In vitro stimulation with insulin and IGF-I reduced CREB and ATF1 transcripts by approximately 50%, whereas CREB phosphorylation was increased. Activation of CREB was accompanied by subsequent reduction in adiponectin and adiponectin receptor (adipoR)1 expression. Under in vivo conditions of diabetes type 1, maternal adiponectin levels were up-regulated in serum and endometrium. Embryonic CREB expression was altered in a cell lineage-specific pattern. Although in EB cells CREB localization did not change, it was translocated from the nucleus into the cytosol in trophoblast (TB) cells. In TB, adiponectin expression was increased (diabetic 427.8 &#xb1; 59.3 pg/mL vs normoinsulinaemic 143.9 &#xb1; 26.5 pg/mL), whereas it was no longer measureable in the EB. Analysis of embryonic adipoRs showed an increased expression of adipoR1 and no changes in adipoR2 transcription. We conclude that the transcription factors CREB and ATFs vitally participate in embryo-maternal cross talk before implantation in a cell lineage-specific manner. Embryonic CREB/ATFs act as insulin/IGF sensors. Lack of insulin is compensated by a CREB-mediated adiponectin expression, which may maintain glucose uptake in blastocysts grown in diabetic mothers.",

    "abstract": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x3b3; (PPAR&#x3b3;) is a unique target for insulin sensitizer agents. These drugs have been used for the clinical treatment of type 2 diabetes for almost twenty years. However, serious safety issues are associated with the PPAR&#x3b3; agonist thiazolidinediones (TZDs). Selective PPAR&#x3b3; modulators (SPPARMs) which retain insulin sensitization without TZDs-like side effects are emerging as a promising new generation of insulin sensitizers. C333H is a novel structure compound synthesized by our laboratory. In diabetic rodent models, C333H has insulin-sensitizing and glucose-lowering activity comparable to that of TZDs, and causes no significant increase in body weight or adipose tissue weight in db/db mice. In diabetic db/db mice, C333H elevated circulating high molecular weight adiponectin isoforms, decreased PPAR&#x3b3; 273 serine phosphorylation in brown adipose tissue and selectively modulated the expression of a subset of PPAR&#x3b3; target genes in adipose tissue. In vitro, C333H weakly recruited coactivator and weakly dissociated corepressor activity. These findings suggest that C333H has similar properties to SPPARMs and may be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.",

    "title": "Aldosterone directly affects apelin expression and secretion in adipocytes.",
    "abstract": "There is a high incidence of metabolic syndrome among patients with primary aldosteronism (PA), which has recently been associated with an unfavorable cardiometabolic profile. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been clarified in detail. Characterizing aldosterone (Ald) target genes in adipocytes will help us to elucidate the deleterious effects associated with excess Ald. Apelin, a novel adipokine, exerts beneficial effects on obesity-associated disorders and cardiovascular homeostasis. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of high Ald levels on apelin expression and secretion and the underlying mechanisms involved in adipocytes. In vivo, a single-dose Ald injection acutely decreased apelin serum levels and adipose tissue apelin production, which demonstrates a clear inverse relationship between the levels of plasma Ald and plasma apelin. Experiments using 3T3-L1 adipocytes showed that Ald decreased apelin expression and secretion in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This effect was reversed by glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonists or GR (NR3C1) knockdown; furthermore, putative HREs were identified in the apelin promoter. Subsequently, we verified that both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids regulated apelin expression through GR activation, although no synergistic effect was observed. Additionally, detailed potential mechanisms involved a p38 MAPK signaling pathway. In conclusion, our findings strengthen the fact that there is a direct interaction between Ald and apelin in adipocytes, which has important implications for hyperaldosteronism or PA-associated cardiometabolic syndrome and hoists apelin on the list of potent therapeutic targets for PA.",

    "abstract": "The fundamental importance of the hypothalamus in the regulation of autonomic and cardiovascular functions is well established. However, the molecular processes involved are not well understood. Here, we show that the mammalian (or mechanistic) target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in the hypothalamus is tied to the activity of the sympathetic nervous system and to cardiovascular function. Modulation of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling caused dramatic changes in sympathetic traffic, blood flow, and arterial pressure. Our data also demonstrate the importance of hypothalamic mTORC1 signaling in transducing the sympathetic and cardiovascular actions of leptin. Moreover, we show that the PI3K pathway links the leptin receptor to mTORC1 signaling and that changes in its activity impact sympathetic traffic and arterial pressure. These findings establish mTORC1 activity in the hypothalamus as a key determinant of sympathetic and cardiovascular regulation and suggest that dysregulated hypothalamic mTORC1 activity may influence the development of cardiovascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "The adipocyte-derived hormone leptin acts in the brain to reduce body weight and fat mass. Recent studies suggest that parvocellular oxytocin (OXT) neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) can mediate body weight reduction through inhibition of food intake and increased energy expenditure. However, the role of OXT neurons of the PVN as a primary target of leptin has not been investigated. Here, we studied the potential role of OXT neurons of the PVN in leptin-mediated effects on body weight regulation in fasted rats. We demonstrated that intracerebroventricular (ICV) leptin activates STAT3 phosphorylation in OXT neurons of the PVN, showed that this occurs in a subpopulation of OXT neurons that innervate the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), and provided further evidence suggesting a role of OXT to mediate leptin's actions on body weight. In addition, our results indicated that OXT neurons are responsive to ICV leptin and mediate leptin effects on body weight in diet induced obese (DIO) rats, which are resistant to the anorectic effects of the hormone. Thus, we conclude that leptin targets a specific subpopulation of parvocellular OXT neurons of the PVN, and that this action may be important for leptin's ability to reduce body weight in both control and obese rats.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that both curcumin and leptin are protective factors against acute injuries. Here, we investigated whether leptin and its signaling pathway mediate the protective effects of curcumin. A solid dispersion of curcumin-polyvinylpyrrolidone K30 was prepared and administered intraperitoneally. In vivo intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in mice determined the effects of curcumin administration on inflammation, oxygen radical production, and leptin expression. In vitro studies using the venous epithelial cell line ECV-304 examined hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced leptin expression and release after curcumin administration. Furthermore, the effects on the leptin-regulated ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways were also explored. Intestinal I/R induced marked bowel injuries. Curcumin treatment significantly improved animal survival and reduced the pathologic injuries in the intestines. Furthermore, the elevated intestinal water content and levels of malondialdehyde, interleukin 1&#x3b2; (IL-1&#x3b2;) and IL-6 were significantly decreased, but levels of superoxide dismutase increased. Interestingly, we found that the decreased leptin and its receptor Ob-Rb were restored by curcumin administration. In addition, in vitro studies showed that curcumin increased leptin expression and release after hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced cell injuries. Moreover, curcumin treatment restored decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation (p-ERK1/2) and inhibited overactive p38 (p-p38) after injuries, and the effect was reversed by a leptin-specific antibody or Ob-R blocker. These data suggest that leptin and Ob-Rb-dependent ERK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways may be involved in curcumin protection against intestinal I/R injury, and leptin may be a potential target of curcumin in intestinal I/R injury and other related acute diseases.",

    "title": "Dyslipidemia in type 2 diabetes: prevalence, pathophysiology, and management.",
    "abstract": "Dyslipidemia is one of the key risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in diabetes mellitus. Despite the mounting clinical trial data, the management of dyslipidemia other than lowering the low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) continues to be controversial. The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are high plasma triglyceride concentration, reduced high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) concentration, and increased concentration of small dense LDL particles. These changes are caused by increased free fatty acid flux secondary to insulin resistance and aggravated by increased inflammatory adipokines. The availability of several lipid-lowering drugs and nutritional supplements offers novel and effective options for achieving target lipid levels in people with diabetes. While initiation of drug therapy based on differences in the lipid profile is an option, most practice guidelines recommend statins as first-line therapy. Although the evidence for clinical utility of combination of statins with fibrates or nicotinic acid in reducing cardiovascular events remains inconclusive, the preponderance of evidence suggests that a subgroup who have high triglycerides and low HDL-c levels may benefit from combination therapy of statins and fibrates. The goal of therapy is to achieve at least 30-40&#xa0;% reduction in LDL-c levels. Preferably the LDL-c should be less than 100&#xa0;mg/dL in low-risk people and less than 70&#xa0;mg/dL in those at high risk, including people with established CVD.",

In this phase IIb clinical trial, 258 patients with type 2 diabetes completed a 12-week protocol with 50, 100, or 150&#x2009;mg of MSDC-0160 (an mTOT modulator), 45&#x2009;mg pioglitazone HCl (a PPAR-&#x3b3; agonist), or a placebo. The two active treatments lowered fasting glucose levels to the same extent. The decreases in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) observed with the two higher doses of MSDC-0160 were not different from those associated with pioglitazone. By contrast, fluid retention as evidenced by reduction in hematocrit, red blood cells, and total hemoglobin was 50% less in the MSDC-0160-treated groups. There was also a smaller increase in high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin with MSDC-0160 than with pioglitazone (P &lt; 0.0001), suggesting that MSDC-0160 produces less expansion of white adipose tissue. Thus, mTOT modulators may have glucose-lowering effects similar to those of pioglitazone but without the adverse effects associated with PPAR-&#x3b3; agonists.",

    "title": "Integration of sensory information via central thermoregulatory leptin targets.",
    "abstract": "The adipocyte derived hormone leptin acts in the brain to regulate body weight, food intake and energy expenditure. Even though it is well accepted that leptin regulates energy expenditure at least in part by modulating thermogenesis, the exact mechanisms are not clear. Particularly, it is unclear which central circuits regulate thermogenic leptin actions and if and how these may interact with feeding circuits. Within the last decade our understanding of central thermoregulatory circuits has increased substantially and allowed the identification of leptin target neurons (those expressing the long form leptin receptor - LepRb) that are involved in the sympathetic control of the heat generating brown adipose tissue (BAT). Indeed, LepRb neurons in the preoptic area and dorsomedial hypothalamus are part of the known thermoregulatory circuits controlling sympathetic premotor neurons that are located in the raphe pallidus. Thermoregulatory control and food intake are both regulated by leptin signaling pathways, even though distinct neuronal pathways have been described, respectively. Nevertheless, feeding status and control of body temperature and energy expenditure are tightly interconnected, but it is unknown how these aspects are connected within leptin signaling pathways to result in appropriate output signals (e.g. BAT thermogenesis). Indeed, cold-induced thermogenesis is potently blocked during fasting, which instead triggers an active decrease in energy expenditure and body temperature, a state known as torpor. In this article we will review recent data characterizing central thermoregulatory LepRb pathways and speculate on potential integration mechanisms that may relay anorexic and thermoregulatory leptin action to control energy homeostasis.",

    "title": "Role of adiponectin in the metabolic syndrome: current perspectives on its modulation as a treatment strategy.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin, a secretory protein specifically expressed by adipose tissue, has been shown to play a critical role in the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis. A deficiency of adiponectin has been linked to a wide variety of metabolic abnormalities, including obesity and associated disorders such as insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, hypertension and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, collectively referred to as the metabolic syndrome. Conversely, increased expression of adiponectin corrects these abnormalities, as revealed by the positive metabolic effects observed in genetic over expression studies or by administration of recombinant adiponectin. This has led to widespread interest in its role as a therapeutic target for treatment of a range of metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases. Various therapeutic approaches targeted at increasing adiponectin levels, or its activity, are being explored. These consist of increasing expression of adiponectin or its receptors by inducers, increasing circulating levels of adiponectin by administering recombinant protein, peptide mimetic approaches, or increasing expression/activity of its downstream effectors such as AMPK or PPAR alpha. Many of these approaches have achieved therapeutic benefits in animal models of metabolic diseases. Despite the profusion of research on adiponectin and ways to modulate it, there are limited number of studies focused on smallmolecule based-therapeutic approaches. In this review, we summarize what is currently known with respect to the therapeutic potential of adiponectin and discuss the challenges in designing small molecule-based therapies.",

    "title": "Apelin ameliorates TNF-&#x3b1;-induced reduction of glycogen synthesis in the hepatocytes through G protein-coupled receptor APJ.",
    "abstract": "Apelin, a novel adipokine, is the specific endogenous ligand of G protein-coupled receptor APJ. Consistent with its putative role as an adipokine, apelin has been linked to states of insulin resistance. However, the function of apelin in hepatic insulin resistance, a vital part of insulin resistance, and its underlying mechanisms still remains unclear. Here we define the impacts of apelin on TNF-&#x3b1;-induced reduction of glycogen synthesis in the hepatocytes. Our studies indicate that apelin reversed TNF-&#x3b1;-induced reduction of glycogen synthesis in HepG2 cells, mouse primary hepatocytes and liver tissues of C57BL/6J mice by improving JNK-IRS1-AKT-GSK pathway. Moreover, Western blot revealed that APJ, but not apelin, expressed in the hepatocytes and liver tissues of mice. We found that F13A, a competitive antagonist for G protein-coupled receptor APJ, suppressed the effects of apelin on TNF-&#x3b1;-induced reduction of glycogen synthesis in the hepatocytes, suggesting APJ is involved in the function of apelin. In conclusion, we show novel evidence suggesting that apelin ameliorates TNF-&#x3b1;-induced reduction of glycogen synthesis in the hepatocytes through G protein-coupled receptor APJ. Apelin appears as a beneficial adipokine with anti-insulin resistance properties, and thus as a promising therapeutic target in metabolic disorders.",

    "abstract": "In postmenopausal women, adipositas represents a serious risk factor for cancer development and progression. White adipose tissue secretes the 16 kDa hormone leptin which plays a key role in the regulation of appetite and metabolism. An increasing number of reports indicate that leptin also interferes with signal transduction pathways implicated in the development of breast cancer. In our previous study, we identified the estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#x3b1;) as a relevant enhancer of leptin-induced signal transduction leading to transactivation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3). The purpose of this study is the investigation of specific target gene expression in response to leptin-mediated Stat3 signaling. We performed a comprehensive microarray analysis of ER&#x3b1;-positive and ER&#x3b1;-negative MDA-MB-231 cells upon leptin treatment and identified 49 genes which showed a significant ER&#x3b1;-dependent regulation in leptin-treated MDA-MB-231 cells. There was no intersection with genes which were merely up- or downregulated by ER&#x3b1; expression and only 9 and 11 genes overlapping targets which were regulated by leptin stimulation either in ER&#x3b1;-expressing or ER&#x3b1;-negative MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively. To demonstrate the specificity, expression of three target genes was validated by quantitative real-time PCR. In conclusion, these data imply that leptin can induce a different set of target genes dependent on ER&#x3b1; expression, which might contribute to the development and progression of cancer diseases.",

While telomere length measurements were largely done in white blood cells, there is lack of studies on telomere length in relation to oxidative stress in target tissues affected in diabetes. Therefore, the aim of this study is to induct oxidative stress in adipocytes and to test whether these adipocytes exhibit shortened telomeres, senescence and functional impairment. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were subjected to oxidative stress and senescence induction by a variety of means for 2 weeks (exogenous application of H2O2, glucose oxidase, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and glucose oscillations). Cells were probed for reactive oxygen species generation (ROS), DNA damage, mRNA and protein expression of senescent and pro-inflammatory markers, telomere length and glucose uptake. Compared to untreated cells, both ROS generation and DNA damage were significantly higher in cells subjected to oxidative stress and senescence. Adipocytes subjected to oxidative stress also showed shortened telomeres and increased mRNA and protein expression of p53, p21, TNF alpha and IL-6. Senescent cells were also characterized by decreased levels of adiponectin and impaired glucose uptake. Briefly, adipocytes under oxidative stress exhibited increased ROS generation, DNA damage, shortened telomeres and switched to senescent/pro-inflammatory phenotype with impaired glucose uptake.",

    "abstract": "Angiogenesis is tightly associated with the outgrowth of adipose tissue, leading to obesity, which is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes and hypertension, mainly because expanding adipose tissue requires an increased nutrient supply from blood vessels. Therefore, induction of vessel abnormality by adipokines has been well-studied, whereas how altered vascular function promotes obesity is relatively unexplored. Also, surviving Prox1 heterozygous mice have shown abnormal lymphatic patterning and adult-onset obesity, indicating that accumulation of adipocytes could be closely linked with lymphatic function. Here, we propose a new antiobesity strategy based on enhancement of lymphatic and blood vessel integrity with apelin. Apelin knockout (KO) mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) showed an obese phenotype associated with abnormal lymphatic and blood vessel enlargement. Fatty acids present in the HFD induced hyperpermeability of endothelial cells, causing adipocyte differentiation, whereas apelin promoted vascular stabilization. Moreover, treatment of apelin KO mice with a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, that were fed an HFD improved vascular function and also attenuated obesity. Finally, apelin transgenic mice showed decreased subcutaneous adipose tissue attributable to inhibition of HFD-induced hyperpermeability of vessels. These results indicate that apelin inhibits HFD-induced obesity by enhancing vessel integrity. Apelin could serve as a therapeutic target for treating obesity and related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Endochondral ossification is a dynamic process. The interaction between leptin and estrogen in this process is complicated. Whether there is a stage specific crosstalk between leptin and estrogen in the differentiation process of the chondrocytes in the growth plate remains unknown. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of leptin on the expression of estrogen receptors and extracellular matrix in ATDC5 cells, an in vitro model of endochondral ossification. First, we quantified the physiological expressions of estrogen receptors &#x3b1;, &#x3b2; (ER&#x3b1;, ER&#x3b2;), leptin receptor (Ob-Rb), type II and type X collagens in definite stages of endochondral ossification in ATDC5 cells using real-time PCR. Dynamic and stage specific expression characteristics of these target genes were observed. Simultaneous expressions of Ob-Rb with ER&#x3b1; or ER&#x3b2; in ATDC5 cells were also found with dual-label confocal immunofluorescency. Then using Western blotting analysis and/or real-time PCR, we detected that, leptin treatment up-regulated the expressions of ER&#x3b1;, ER&#x3b2; and type II collagen, but down-regulated type X collagen expression and the ER&#x3b1;/ER&#x3b2; ratio in the chondrogenic differentiation stage. Meanwhile, leptin down-regulated the expressions of ER&#x3b1;, type II and type X collagens, and the ER&#x3b1;/ER&#x3b2; ratio, but up-regulated the expression of ER&#x3b2; in the hypertrophic differentiation stage. Significant positive correlation existed between ER&#x3b1; and type II collagen expression, and between the ratio of ER&#x3b1;/ER&#x3b2; and type X collagen production. In summary, the crosstalk between leptin and estrogen receptor might be differentiation stage specific in ATDC5 cells.",

Experimental studies. Research laboratory. Immature rats primed with gonadotropins to induce ovulation. In&#xa0;vivo studies: rats received either an acute or daily treatment with leptin. In&#xa0;vitro studies: ovarian explants were cultured in the absence or presence of leptin (0.3-500 ng/mL). The expression of both messenger RNA and protein of StAR, P450scc, and 3&#x3b2;HSD were measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot, respectively. The acute treatment with leptin, which inhibits the ovulatory process, caused a significant reduction in the ovarian expression of P450scc without changes in StAR or 3&#x3b2;HSD. In contrast, the daily treatment, which induces the ovulatory process, showed an increased expression of the ovarian 3&#x3b2;HSD protein, without differences in the other proteins measured. We also found that leptin increased the protein of both P450scc and 3&#x3b2;HSD at physiological levels and inhibited both messenger RNA and protein of 3&#x3b2;HSD at higher concentrations. The results indicate that 1) leptin is able to regulate the expression of the 3&#x3b2;HSD protein in a dose-dependent manner; and 2) leptin seems to exert its dual effects on P synthesis on different targets in a dose-dependent manner.",

Nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism; PPAR ligands are used to treat dyslipidemias. Fibrates have a major impact on TG metabolism as well as on modulating LDL size and subclasses. Fibrates target atherogenic dyslipidemia by increasing plasma HDL-C concentrations and decreasing small dense LDL (sdLDL) particles and TGs, thus contributing to dyslipidemia management, particularly in patients with diabetes (DM) or the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Furthermore, fibrates exert beneficial effects on adipokines, inflammation and oxidative stress as well as neuroprotective properties. However, further studies are needed to define the role of fibrates in the prevention of CV events. We review the effects of fibrates on atherogenic dyslipidemia and CV risk reduction.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin is a multifunctional cytokine that has a role in regulating inflammation. Here we determined whether adiponectin modulates ischemic acute kidney injury. Compared with wild-type mice, adiponectin-knockout mice were found to have lower serum creatinine and less tubular damage or apoptosis following ischemia/reperfusion injury. This latter process was associated with decreased Bax and reduced activation of p53 and caspase-3. Targeted disruption of adiponectin was also found to inhibit the infiltration of neutrophils, macrophages, and T cells into the injured kidneys. This was associated with inhibition of NF-&#x3ba;B activation and reduced expression of the proinflammatory molecules IL-6, TNF-&#x3b1;, MCP-1, and MIP-2 in the kidney after ischemia/reperfusion injury. Wild-type mice engrafted with adiponectin-null bone marrow had less kidney dysfunction and tubular damage than adiponectin-null mice engrafted with wild-type bone marrow. Conversely, adiponectin-null mice engrafted with wild-type bone marrow had similar renal dysfunction and tubular damage compared with wild-type mice engrafted with wild-type bone marrow. In cultured macrophages, adiponectin directly promoted macrophage migration: a process blocked by the PI3 kinase inhibitor, LY294002. Thus, our results show that adiponectin has a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of acute renal ischemia/reperfusion injury and may be a potential therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Because the functional apoptosis-initiating protein, cytochrome C (CytC) is rapidly cleared from the circulation (t1/2 (half-life): 4 minutes), it cannot be used for in vivo therapy. We report herein on a hitherto unreported strategy for delivering exogenous CytC as a potential and safe antiobesity drug for preventing diet-induced obesity, the most common type of obesity in humans. The functional activity of CytC encapsulated in prohibitin (a white fat vessel-specific receptor)-targeted nanoparticles (PTNP) was evaluated quantitatively, as evidenced by the observations that CytC-loaded PTNP causes apoptosis in primary adipose endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas CytC alone did not. The delivery of a single dose of CytC through PTNP into the circulation disrupted the vascular structure by the targeted apoptosis of adipose endothelial cells in vivo. Intravenous treatment of CytC-loaded PTNP resulted in a substantial reduction in obesity in high-fat diet (HFD) fed wild-type (wt) mice, as evidenced by the dose-dependent prevention of the percentage of increase in body weight and decrease in serum leptin levels. In addition, no detectable hepatotoxicity was found to be associated with this prevention. Thus, the finding highlights the promising potential of CytC for use as an antiobesity drug, when delivered through a nanosystem.",

The increase in fat accumulation, which is associated with obesity, may significantly change the expression of several bioactive molecules known as adipokines. These adipokines interact not only with adipose tissue, but also with metabolically relevant organs such as liver and muscle. Understanding the molecular basics of potential novel targets might help to improve the therapeutic treatment of people who suffer from obesity. Herein we summarize the state of the art of two novel adipokines and their impaired or protective action in obesity: chemerin and vaspin. Their expression patterns, signal transduction activity, and resulting functions within the human body are introduced. We also discuss various possibilities to target these adipokines, which may represent promising new targets for the treatment of obesity by small and synthetic compounds.",

    "abstract": "Liver disease due to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is an important health problem worldwide. HCV induced changes in microRNAs (miRNA) are shown to mediate inflammation leading to liver fibrosis. Gene expression analyses identified dysregulation of miRNA-449a in HCV patients but not in alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver diseases. By sequence analysis of the promoter for YKL40, an inflammatory marker upregulated in patients with chronic liver diseases with fibrosis, adjacent binding sites for nuclear factor of Kappa B/P65 and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBP&#x3b1;) were identified. P65 interacted with CEBP&#x3b1; to co-operatively activate YKL40 expression through sequence specific DNA binding. In vitro analysis demonstrated that tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#x3b1;) mediated YKL40 expression is regulated by miRNA-449a and its target NOTCH1 in human hepatocytes.NOTCH1 facilitated nuclear localization of P65 in response to TNF&#x3b1;. Further, HCV patients demonstrated upregulation of NOTCH1 along with downregulation of miRNA-449a. Taken together it is demonstrated that miRNA-449a plays an important role in modulating expression of YKL40 through targeting the components of the NOTCH signaling pathway following HCV infection.

    "abstract": "Epidemiological data indicate an increasing incidence of asthma in the obese individuals recent decades, while very little is known about the possible association between them. Here, we compared the roles of adipocyte-derived factors, including leptin, adiponectin and resistin on proliferation, wound repair and apoptosis in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) which play an important role in the pathogenesis of asthma. The results showed that exogenous globular adiponectin (gAd) promoted proliferation, cell-cycle and wound repair of HBECs. This effect may be relevant to Ca(2+)/calmodulin signal pathway. Besides, gAd inhibited apoptosis induced by ozone and release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of HBECs via regulated adipoR1 and reactive oxygen species. No effects of leptin or resistin on proliferation, wound repair and apoptosis of HBECs were detectable. These data indicate that airway epithelium is the direct target of gAd which plays an important role in protecting HBECs from mechanical or oxidant injuries and may have therapeutic implications in the treatment of asthma.",

    "abstract": "Leptin promotes atherosclerosis and vessel wall remodeling. As abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) formation involves tissue remodeling, we hypothesized that local leptin synthesis initiates and promotes this process. Human surgical AAA walls were analyzed for antigen and mRNA levels of leptin and leptin receptor, as well as mRNA for matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-9 and MMP-12. Leptin and leptin receptor antigen were evident in all AAAs, and leptin, MMP-9, and MMP-12 mRNA was increased relative to age-matched nondilated controls. To simulate in vivo local leptin synthesis, ApoE(-/-) mice were subjected to a paravisceral periaortic application of low-dose leptin. Leptin-treated aortas exhibited decreased transforming growth factor-&#x3b2; and increased MMP-9 mRNA levels 5 days after surgery, and leptin receptor mRNA was upregulated by day 28. Serial ultrasonography demonstrated accelerated regional aortic diameter growth after 28 days, correlating with local medial degeneration, increased MMP-9, MMP-12, and periadventitial macrophage clustering. Furthermore, the combination of local periaortic leptin and systemic angiotensin II administration augmented medial MMP-9 synthesis and aortic aneurysm size. Leptin is locally synthesized in human AAA wall. Paravisceral aortic leptin in ApoE(-/-) mice induces local medial degeneration and augments angiotensin II-induced AAA, thus suggesting novel mechanistic links between leptin and AAA formation.",

    "abstract": "Gegen Qinlian Decoction (GGQLD) is one of the well-known traditional Chinese medicines. Recently, it was reported that GGQLD had good clinical effects on type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, few studies have confirmed in detail the anti-diabetic activities of GGQLD in vivo and in vitro. In the present study, we investigated the anti-diabetic effects of GGQLD in high-fat diet combined with streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The present results suggested GGQLD (4.95, 11.55 and 18.15 g/kg) decreased significantly fasting blood glucose, glycosylated serum protein, and glycosylated hemoglobin of diabetic rats (p&lt;0.05), and GGQLD (4.95 and 18.15 g/kg) decreased significantly fasting serum insulin levels of diabetic rats (p&lt;0.05); in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, Gegen Qinlian Decoction-containing serum (GGQLD-CS) (4%, 8% and 16%) enhanced glucose consumption, triglyceride (TG) content, adiponectin protein concentration and the mRNA expression of adiponectin. Adiponectin contributes to the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism, and can play a critical role in the development of diabetes mellitus; the mechanisms of action of GGQLD might be related to augmentation of adiponectin protein concentration and up-regulation of the mRNA expression of adiponectin. However, the multi-target mechanisms of action of GGQLD need to be clarified further. The present study further validated the beneficial effects of GGQLD as an anti-diabetic agent. These findings provide a new insight into the anti-diabetic application for GGQLD in clinic and display the potential of GGQLD as a new drug candidate for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.",

    "title": "Effects of telmisartan and valsartan on insulin sensitivity in obese diabetic mice.",
    "abstract": "Telmisartan and valsartan have angiotensin II receptor blocking activity. Because telmisartan has also an agonistic action for peroxisome proliferators-activator receptor (PPAR)-&#x3b3;, it is speculated that an effect of telmisartan on insulin sensitivity is different from that of valsartan, which lacks of PPAR-&#x3b3; agonistic activity. To address the issue, effects of telmisartan and valsartan on insulin sensitivity, adipocytokines and PPAR-&#x3b3; target genes were evaluated in obese diabetic mice. KK-A(y) mice were treated with telmisartan (5mg/kg) and valsartan (15 mg/kg), once daily for 3 weeks. Insulin tolerance test was performed on day 14, and plasma adiponectin concentration and mRNA expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1; (TNF-&#x3b1;) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in adipose tissues were measured on day 21. Time-course of plasma glucose level after the injection of insulin in mice with telmisartan was not significantly different from that of animals with valsartan. In addition, PPAR-&#x3b3; antagonist did not diminished the improvement of insulin sensitivity by telmisartan. Telmisartan and valsartan elevated plasma adiponectin concentration and suppressed the mRNA expressions of TNF-&#x3b1; and IL-6 in adipose tissues. These variables of the telmisartan- and valsartan-treated groups did not significantly differ. Influence of telmisartan on the PPAR-&#x3b3; target genes (ap2 and fatty acid synthase) mRNA expressions was not detected in adipose tissues under the present condition. These data suggest that the effect of telmisartan on insulin sensitivity is similar to that of valsartan, and a role of PPAR-&#x3b3;-mediated stimuli is small in the telmisartan-induced improvement of insulin sensitivity.",

Hundreds of proteins including many identified and potential drug targets have been reported to be involved in adiponectin related signaling pathways, which comprised a complicated regulation network.

    "abstract": "Both proconvulsive and anticonvulsive roles of leptin have been reported, suggesting cell-specific actions of leptin in different models of seizure and epilepsy. The goal of our study was to determine the regulation and function of astrocytic leptin receptors in a mouse model of epilepsy and glutamate-induced cytotoxicity. We show that in pilocarpine-challenged mice developing epilepsy with recurrent seizures after a latent period of 2 weeks, hippocampal leptin receptor (ObR) immunofluorescence was increased at 6 weeks. This was more pronounced in astrocytes than in neurons. In cultured astrocytes, glutamate increased ObRa and ObRb expression, whereas leptin pretreatment attenuated glial cytotoxicity by excess glutamate, reflected by better preserved adenosine triphosphate production. The protective role of astrocytic leptin signaling is further supported by the higher lethality of the astrocyte-specific leptin receptor knockout mice in the initial phase of seizure production. Thus, leptin signaling in astrocytes plays a protective role against seizure, and the effects are at least partially mediated by attenuation of glutamate toxicity. Astrocytic leptin signaling, therefore, may be a novel therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Omentin-1, a new adipokine released from adipose tissue, is associated with several key aspects of metabolic syndrome such as insulin sensitivity. However, it is not known whether omentin-1 affects cancer cell growth. In this study, we studied the influence of omentin-1 on two types of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells: HepG2 and HuH-7 cells. Cell viability assay showed that omentin-1 (1 and 2 &#x3bc;g/ml) significantly inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 and HuH-7 cells. Both annexin+PI staining and TUNEL assay showed that omentin-1 induced apoptosis in these cells. Moreover, omentin-1 treatment upregulated protein levels of p53 and p21, a main transcriptional target of p53. Interestingly, omentin-1 did not affect p53 mRNA level. Further mechanism study showed that omentin-1 upregulated p53 protein level through decreasing p53 deacetylation and thereby increasing the stability of p53 protein. Using small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown, we found that Sirt1 deacetylase, but not histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), was required for the effect of omentin-1 on p53 deacetylation and cancer cell proliferation. In omentin-1 treated HepG2 cells, the bax/bcl-2 protein ratio was increased, while the caspase-3 signaling pathway was also activated. Omentin-1 triggered JNK signaling but not p38 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Collectively, our data suggests that the novel adipokine omentin-1 may contribute to the therapeutic strategy for hepatocellular carcinoma.",

    "title": "Enhancement of leptin receptor signaling by SOCS3 deficiency induces development of gastric tumors in mice.",
    "abstract": "Leptin acts on its receptor (ObR) in the hypothalamus to inhibit food intake and energy expenditure. Leptin and ObR are also expressed in the gastrointestinal tract; however, the physiological significance of leptin signaling in the gut remains uncertain. Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) is a key negative feedback regulator of ObR-mediated signaling in the hypothalamus. We now show that gastrointestinal epithelial cell-specific SOCS3 conditional knockout (T3b-SOCS3 cKO) mice developed gastric tumors by enhancing leptin production and the ObRb/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway. All T3b-SOCS3 cKO mice developed tumors in the stomach but not in the bowels by 2 months of age, even though the SOCS3 deletion occurred in both the epithelium of stomach and bowels. The tumors developed in the absence of the inflammatory response and all cKO mice died within 6 months. These tumors displayed pathology and molecular alterations, such as an increase in MUC2 (Mucin 2, oligomeric mucus/gel-forming) and TFF3 (trefoil factor 3), resembling human intestinal-type gastric tumors. Administration of antileptin antibody to T3b-SOCS3 cKO mice reduced hyperplasia of gastric mucosa, which is the step of the initiation of gastric tumor. These data suggest that SOCS3 is an antigastric tumor gene that suppresses leptin overexpression and ObRb/STAT3 hyperactivation, supporting the hypothesis that the leptin/ObRb/STAT3 axis accelerates tumorigenesis and that it may represent a new therapeutic target for the treatment of gastric cancer.",

    "title": "Potential effect of angiotensin II receptor blockade in adipose tissue and bone.",
    "abstract": "Recent evidence demonstrated that dysregulation of adipocytokine functions seen in abdominal obesity may be involved in the pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome. Angiotensinogen, the precursor of angiotensin (Ang) II, is produced primarily in the liver, and also in adipose tissue, where it is up-regulated during the development of obesity and involved in blood pressure regulation and adipose tissue growth. Blockade of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) attenuates weight gain and adiposity by enhanced energy expenditure, and the favorable metabolic effects of telmisartan have been related to its Ang II receptor blockade and action as a partial agonist of peroxisome proliferators activated receptor (PPAR)-&#x3b3;. PPAR&#x3b3; plays an important role in regulating carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and ligands for PPAR&#x3b3; can improve insulin sensitivity and reduce triglyceride levels. Similarly, bone metabolism is closely regulated by hormones and cytokines, which have effects on both bone resorption and deposition. It is known that the receptors of Ang II are expressed in culture osteoclasts and osteoblasts, and Ang II is postulated to be able to act upon the cells involved in bone metabolism. In in vitro system, Ang II induced the differentiation and activation of osteoclasts responsible for bone resorption. Importantly, it was demonstrated by the sub-analysis of a recent clinical study that the fracture risk was significantly reduced by the usage of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. To treat the subgroups of hypertensive patients with osteoporosis RAS can be considered a novel target.",

    "title": "The central nervous system as a promising target to treat diabetes mellitus.",
    "abstract": "Most of the drugs available to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) act either in the pancreas by increasing insulin secretion or in tissues such as the liver or muscle by improving insulin sensitivity. However, recent studies have shown that the brain also plays a critical role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. For example, central leptin administration reduces hyperglycemia and improves the survival of mice with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). In addition, several pieces of evidence show that the brain can control the insulin sensitivity in different tissues and the pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Therefore, the brain emerges as a promising new target of drugs aiming to treat both T1DM and T2DM. An exciting finding is that there is a partial overlap between neuronal populations that regulate energy balance and glucose homeostasis. Therefore, obesity and T2DM may have similar origins that are related to dysfunctions in the central nervous system. Likewise, future drugs that target the brain to treat T2DM may have beneficial effects in reducing body weight, and vice versa. In this review, the recent data showing how the brain is able to have an important regulatory effect over blood glucose levels as well as the possible neuronal circuitries involved in the control of glucose homeostasis will be summarized. The opportunities and challenges of using synthetic drugs or natural compounds that act in the central nervous system to treat diabetes mellitus will also be discussed.",

    "abstract": "Liraglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue that stimulates insulin secretion and improves &#x3b2;-cell function. However, it is not clear whether liraglutide achieves its glucose lowering effect only by its known effects or whether other as yet unknown mechanisms are involved. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of liraglutide on Fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF-21) activity in High-fat diet (HFD) fed ApoE(-/-) mice with adiponectin (Acrp30) knockdown. HFD-fed ApoE(-/-) mice were treated with adenovirus vectors expressing shAcrp30 to produce insulin resistance. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies were performed to evaluate insulin sensitivity of the mouse model. QRT-PCR and Western blot were used to measure the mRNA and protein expression of the target genes. The combination of HFD, ApoE deficiency, and hypoadiponectinemia resulted in an additive effect on insulin resistance. FGF-21 mRNA expressions in both liver and adipose tissues were significantly increased while FGF-21 receptor 1 (FGFR-1) and &#x3b2;-Klotho mRNA levels in adipose tissue, as well as FGFR-1-3 and &#x3b2;-Klotho mRNA levels in liver were significantly decreased in this model. Liraglutide treatment markedly improved insulin resistance and increased FGF-21 expression in liver and FGFR-3 in adipose tissue, restored &#x3b2;-Klotho mRNA expression in adipose tissue as well as FGFR-1-3, &#x3b2;-Klotho levels and phosphorylation of FGFR1 up to the levels observed in control mice in liver. Liraglutide treatment also further increased FGF-21 proteins in liver and plasma. In addition, as shown by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, liraglutide treatment also markedly improved glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in these animals. These findings demonstrate an additive effect of HFD, ApoE deficiency, and adiponectin knockdown on insulin resistance and unveil that the regulation of glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity by liraglutide may be partly mediated via increased FGF-21 and its receptors action.",

Treatment with bixin and norbixin induced the mRNA expression of PPAR&#x3b1; target genes involved in fatty acid oxidation in PPAR&#x3b1;-expressing HepG2 hepatocytes. In obese KK-Ay mice, bixin treatment suppressed the development of hyperlipidemia and hepatic lipid accumulation. In the livers of bixin-treated mice, the mRNA levels of PPAR&#x3b1; target genes related to fatty acid oxidation were up-regulated. Moreover, bixin treatment also improved obesity-induced dysfunctions of carbohydrate metabolism, such as hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypoadiponectinemia. Glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test revealed that glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in KK-Ay obese mice were attenuated by the treatment with bixin. These results indicate that bixin acts as a food-derived agonist of PPAR&#x3b1;, and bixin treatment is useful for the management of obesity-induced metabolic dysfunctions in mice.",

    "title": "Leptin modulates dose-dependently the metabolic and cytolytic activities of NK-92 cells.",
    "abstract": "Leptin, a hormone-cytokine produced primarily in the adipose tissue, has pleiotropic effects on many biological systems and in several cell types, including immune cells. Hyperleptinemia is associated with immune dysfunction and carcinogenesis. Natural killer (NK) cells are critical mediators of anti-tumor immunity, and leptin receptor deficiency in mice leads to impaired NK function. It was thus decided to explore the in vitro effects of leptin on human NK cell function. NK-92 cells were cultured during 48 h with different leptin concentrations [absence, 10 (physiological), 100 (obesity), or 200 ng/ml (pharmacology)]. Their metabolic activity was assessed using the resazurin test. NK-92 cell cytotoxicity and intracellular IFN-&#x3b3; production were analyzed by flow cytometry. NK-92 cell mRNA and protein expression levels of cytotoxic effectors were determined by RT-qPCR and Western blot. In our conditions, leptin exerted a dose-dependent stimulatory effect on NK-92 cell metabolic activity. In addition, high leptin concentrations enhanced NK-92 cell cytotoxicity against K562-EGFP and MDA-MB-231-EGFP target cells and inversely reduced cytotoxicity against the MCF-7-EGFP target. At 100 ng/ml, leptin up-regulated both NK cell granzyme B and TRAIL protein expressions and concomitantly down-regulated perforin expression without affecting Fas-L expression. In response to PMA/ionomycin stimulation, the proportion of IFN-&#x3b3; expressing NK-92 cells increased with 100 and 200 ng/ml of leptin. In conclusion, leptin concentration, at obesity level, variably increased NK-92 cell metabolic activity and modulated NK cell cytotoxicity according to the target cells. The underlying mechanisms are partly due to an up-regulation of TRAIL and IFN-&#x3b3; expression and a down-regulation of perforin.",

    "abstract": "Apelin-APJ signalling is known to play important roles in heart physiology and pathology; however, its functions in liver physiology and pathology remain unclear. On the other hand, Fas is an important molecule in hepatitis and other liver disease that belongs to the death receptor family. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between apelin-APJ signaling and Fas-mediated liver injury in mice. APJ(-/-) mice and wild type (WT) mice were administered an intraperitoneal injection of an agonistic anti-Fas antibody (clone; Jo2), and sacrificed after 3 or 6 h to assess the liver histology. The expression levels of apelin and APJ, plasma levels of transaminases, activities of hepatic caspases and activations of stress-activated protein kinases were also analysed. Before the Jo2 injection, APJ was weakly expressed in the hepatocytes in spots; on the other hand, after the Jo2 injection, it had spread into whole hepatocytes. Moreover, the mRNA expression level of apelin and APJ in the liver increased after Jo2 injection. In the APJ(-/-) mice, the liver injuries and apoptotic changes were significantly inhibited as compared with those in the WT mice. Dramatic increase in JNK activation was observed in the WT mice after Jo2 injection, whereas such activation was completely absent in the APJ(-/-) mice. JNK inhibitor partially, but significantly suppressed Jo2-mediated liver injury in WT mice. Apelin-APJ signalling may promote Fas-induced liver injury at least partially via JNK activation, and may thus serve as a potential therapeutic target in cases of acute liver injury.",

    "abstract": "Leptin suppresses appetite by modulating the expression of hypothalamic neuropeptides including proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP). Yet during pregnancy, caloric consumption increases despite elevated plasma leptin levels. To investigate this paradox, we measured leptin and soluble leptin receptor in plasma and leptin, POMC, and AgRP in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 21 fasting pregnant women before delivery by cesarean section at a university hospital and from 14 fasting nonpregnant women. Prepregnancy body mass index was 24.6 &#xb1; 1.1 (SE) vs. 31.3 &#xb1; 1.3 at term vs. 26.5 &#xb1; 1.6 kg/m(2) in controls. Plasma leptin (32.9 &#xb1; 4.6 vs. 16.7 &#xb1; 3.0 ng/ml) and soluble leptin receptor (30.9 &#xb1; 2.3 vs. 22.1 &#xb1; 1.4 ng/ml) levels were significantly higher in pregnant women. However, mean CSF leptin did not differ between the two groups (283 &#xb1; 34 vs. 311 &#xb1; 32 pg/ml), consistent with a relative decrease in leptin transport into CSF during pregnancy. Accordingly, the CSF/plasma leptin percentage was 1.0 &#xb1; 0.01% in pregnant subjects vs. 2.1 &#xb1; 0.2% in controls (P &lt; 0.0001). Mean CSF AgRP was significantly higher in pregnant subjects (32.3 &#xb1; 2.7 vs. 23.5 &#xb1; 2.5 pg/ml; P = 0.03). Mean CSF POMC was not significantly different in pregnant subjects (200 &#xb1; 13.6 vs. 229 &#xb1; 17.3 fmol/ml; P = 0.190). However, the mean AgRP/POMC ratio was significantly higher among pregnant women (P = 0.003), consistent with an overall decrease in melanocortin tone favoring increased food intake during pregnancy. These data demonstrate that despite peripheral hyperleptinemia, positive energy balance is achieved during pregnancy by a relative decrease in central leptin concentrations and resistance to leptin's effects on target neuropeptides that regulate energy balance.",

    "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can no longer be considered as a disease affecting only the lungs. Increasing evidence supports the presence of a systemic inflammatory component which is thought to provide the link between COPD and the co-morbidities commonly associated with this disease. These include cardiovascular disorders, skeletal muscle dysfunction, diabetes, and osteoporosis. The majority of current therapies for COPD have been developed to improve airway obstruction or to target airway inflammation, leaving an unmet medical need with respect to the systemic inflammatory component of COPD and its extra-pulmonary manifestations. This review describes systemic biomarkers in COPD and their relationship with both the local lung and systemic manifestations of the disease. A summary is provided of the most promising biomarkers that have been investigated in COPD and its co-morbidities. Such biomarkers may be used to assess and manage the systemic effects of COPD, and may guide future development of novel therapeutic interventions to provide a more holistic approach to treating this multi-faceted disease.",

    "title": "The adipokine adiponectin has potent anti-fibrotic effects mediated via adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase: novel target for fibrosis therapy.",
    "abstract": "Fibrosis in scleroderma is associated with collagen deposition and myofibroblast accumulation. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR-&#x3b3;), a master regulator of adipogenesis, inhibits profibrotic responses induced by transforming growth factor-&#xdf; (TGF-&#x3b2;), and its expression is impaired in scleroderma. The roles of adiponectin, a PPAR-&#x3b3; regulated pleiotropic adipokine, in regulating the response of fibroblasts and in mediating the effects of PPAR-&#x3b3; are unknown. Regulation of fibrotic gene expression and TGF-&#xdf; signaling by adiponectin and adenosine monophosphate protein-activated (AMP) kinase agonists were examined in normal fibroblasts in monolayer cultures and in three-dimensional skin equivalents. AdipoR1/2 expression on skin fibroblasts was determined by real-time quantitative PCR. Adiponectin, an adipokine directly regulated by PPAR-&#x3b3;, acts as a potent anti-fibrotic signal in normal and scleroderma fibroblasts that abrogates the stimulatory effects of diverse fibrotic stimuli and reduces elevated collagen gene expression in scleroderma fibroblasts. Adiponectin responses are mediated via AMP kinase, a fuel-sensing cellular enzyme that is necessary and sufficient for down-regulation of fibrotic genes by blocking canonical Smad signaling. Moreover, we demonstrate that endogenous adiponectin accounts, at least in part, for the anti-fibrotic effects exerted by ligands of PPAR-&#x3b3;. These findings reveal a novel link between cellular energy metabolism and extracellular matrix homeostasis converging on AMP kinase. Since the levels of adiponectin as well as its receptor are impaired in scleroderma patients with progressive fibrosis, the present results suggest a potential role for defective adiponectin expression or function in progressive fibrogenesis in scleroderma and other chronic fibrosing conditions. Restoring the adiponectin signaling axis in fibroblasts might, therefore, represent a novel pharmacological approach to controlling fibrosis.",

    "title": "Do mast cells link obesity and asthma?",
    "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the lungs. Both the number of cases and severity of asthma have been increasing without a clear explanation. Recent evidence suggests that obesity, which has also been increasing alarmingly, may worsen or precipitate asthma, but there is little evidence of how obesity may contribute to lung inflammation. We propose that mast cells are involved in both asthma and obesity by being the target and source of adipocytokines, 'alarmins' such as interleukin-9 (IL-9) and interleukin-33 (IL-33), and stress molecules including corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and neurotensin (NT), secreted in response to the metabolic burden. In particular, CRH and NT have synergistic effects on mast cell secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). IL-33 augments VEGF release induced by substance P (SP) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) release induced by NT. Both IL-9 and IL-33 also promote lung mast cell infiltration and augment allergic inflammation. These molecules are also expressed in human mast cells leading to autocrine effects. Obese patients are also less sensitive to glucocorticoids and bronchodilators. Development of effective mast cell inhibitors may be a novel approach for the management of both asthma and obesity. Certain flavonoid combinations may be a promising new treatment approach.",

    "abstract": "In patients with carotid stenosis, we prospectively investigated the association of novel adipokines, apelin and visfatin, with gray-scale median (GSM) score, a valid index of carotid plaque vulnerability. We also assessed the impact of atorvastatin therapy on the above biochemical and imaging markers. Seventy-four overweight [body-mass index (BMI) &gt; 25 kg/m(2) , fat-mass &gt; 30%], statin-free patients, with carotid stenosis, but without indications for intervention were enrolled. Thirty-eight age-, sex- and BMI-matched healthy subjects served as healthy controls (HC). All patients received gradual titrated (10-80 mg) atorvastatin therapy to target LDL-C &lt; 100 mg/dL. GSM score, blood pressure (BP), fat-mass, lipid profile, and serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), apelin and visfatin levels were obtained at baseline and after 24 months. At baseline, patients with carotid atherosclerosis had worse lipid profile, lower apelin and higher systolic BP, hsCRP, visfatin levels compared with HC (P &lt; 0&#xb7;05). Notably, decreased apelin (P &lt; 0&#xb7;001) and GSM score (P = 0&#xb7;010), while increased visfatin (P = 0&#xb7;019) and hsCRP (P = 0&#xb7;039) levels were found in symptomatic rather than asymptomatic patients. At baseline, GSM score correlated with fat-mass, BMI, LDL-C, visfatin and apelin (P &lt; 0&#xb7;05). Apelin, visfatin and fat-mass remained independent determinants of baseline GSM score (R(2) = 0&#xb7;391, P = 0&#xb7;007). In parallel, we found that apelin increment and LDL-C reduction were independently associated with the atorvastatin-induced GSM increase (R(2) = 0&#xb7;411, P = 0&#xb7;011). Increased fat-mass, low apelin and high visfatin serum levels seem to correlate with carotid plaque vulnerability in patients with carotid stenosis. The atorvastatin-induced modification of apelin and LDL-C may beneficially affect carotid plaque stability.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin is an adipokine secreted from adipocytes and plays important roles in the suppression of metabolic syndromes that can result in type 2 diabetes, obesity, and atherosclerosis. Adiponectin is a promising drug target because a number of studies have shown that upregulation of adiponectin has a number of therapeutic benefits. Extensive efforts have revealed various adiponectin regulators, such as cytokines, transcription factors, and drugs. Cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor &#x3b1;, IL-6, and IL-18, downregulate adiponectin production. On the other hand, transcription factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#x3b3; (PPAR&#x3b3;), CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein &#x3b1;, and forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) upregulate adiponectin expression, although the activating transcription factor 3 and cAMP response element-binding protein downregulate it. Although a number of therapeutic drugs have been reported as adiponectin secretion regulators, most of them act through PPAR&#x3b3;-dependent mechanisms, leaving PPAR&#x3b3;-derived side effects as a concern. Using high-throughput screening, we have identified PPAR&#x3b3;-independent adiponectin secretion regulators as potential drug candidates with a novel mechanism of action.",

    "abstract": "Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) reduces body fat in rodents and humans, and increases glycerol release from isolated rat epididymal adipocytes and human visceral adipose tissue explants. It suggests that DHEA stimulates triglyceride hydrolysis in adipose tissue; however, the mechanisms underlying this action are still unclear. We examined the effects of DHEA on the expression of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), the key enzymes of lipolysis, in rat epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT). Male Wistar rats were fed a diet containing 0.6% DHEA for 2 weeks and eWAT was analyzed for mRNA and protein expression of ATGL and HSL, as well as mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x3b3; 2 (PPAR&#x3b3;2) and its downstream target fatty acid translocase (FAT). Glycerol release from eWAT explants and serum free fatty acids (FFA) were also measured. Rats that received DHEA gained less weight, had 23% lower eWAT mass and 31% higher serum FFA levels than controls. Cultured explants of eWAT from DHEA-treated rats released 81% more glycerol than those from control rats. DHEA administration upregulated ATGL mRNA (1.62-fold, P&lt;0.05) and protein (1.78-fold, P&lt;0.05) expression as well as augmented HSL mRNA levels (1.36-fold, P&lt;0.05) and Ser660 phosphorylation of HSL (2.49-fold, P&lt;0.05). PPAR&#x3b3;2 and FAT mRNA levels were also increased in DHEA-treated rats (1.61-fold, P&lt;0.05 and 2.16-fold, P&lt;0.05; respectively). Moreover, ATGL, HSL, and FAT mRNA levels were positively correlated with PPAR&#x3b3;2 expression. This study demonstrates that DHEA promotes lipid mobilization in adipose tissue by increasing the expression and activity of ATGL and HSL. The effects of DHEA appear to be mediated, at least in part, via PPAR&#x3b3;2 activation, which in turn upregulates ATGL and HSL gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of amyloid-&#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;) is a key event mediating the cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) as A&#x3b2; promotes synaptic dysfunction and triggers neuronal death. Recent evidence has linked the hormone leptin to AD as leptin levels are markedly attenuated in AD patients. Leptin is also a potential cognitive enhancer as it facilitates the cellular events underlying hippocampal learning and memory. Here we show that leptin prevents the detrimental effects of A&#x3b2;(1-42) on hippocampal long-term potentiation. Moreover leptin inhibits A&#x3b2;(1-42)-driven facilitation of long-term depression and internalization of the 2-amino-3-(5-methyl-3-oxo-1,2- oxazol-4-yl)propanoic acid (AMPA) receptor subunit, GluR1, via activation of PI3-kinase. Leptin also protects cortical neurons from A&#x3b2;(1-42)-induced cell death by a signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3)-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, leptin inhibits A&#x3b2;(1-42)-mediated upregulation of endophilin I and phosphorylated tau in vitro, whereas cortical levels of endophilin I and phosphorylated tau are enhanced in leptin-insensitive Zucker fa/fa rats. Thus leptin benefits the functional characteristics and viability of neurons that degenerate in AD. These novel findings establish that the leptin system is an important therapeutic target in neurodegenerative conditions.",

    "abstract": "Obesity in human is an alarming major public health crisis worldwide and insulin resistance is a hallmark of it. The negative cross-talk between skeletal muscle and adipose tissue through adipokines is now accepted as one of the leading cause of insulin resistance. Chemerin is a novel adipokine previously reported to induce insulin resistance in primary human skeletal muscle cells. To investigate the role of chemerin in myogenesis, C2C12 cells were used and treated with chemerin in proliferation and differentiation stages. Our results showed that chemerin promoted proliferation and suppressed differentiation of C2C12 cells through extracellular-signal regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways, and these two pathways were interacted with each other in C2C12 cells treated with chemerin. It is concluded from this in vitro study that chemerin which expression is increased during myoblast differentiation appears to be able, likely in an autocrine/paracrine manner, to increase myoblast proliferation and decrease myoblast differentiation.",

    "title": "Resveratrol-induced changes of the human adipocyte secretion profile.",
    "abstract": "Enlarged white adipose tissue (WAT) is a feature of obesity and leads to changes in its paracrine and endocrine function. Dysfunction of WAT cells is associated with obesity-associated disorders like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Resveratrol (RSV), a natural polyphenolic compound, mimics beneficial effects of calorie restriction. As such, RSV seems a promising therapeutic target for obesity-associated disorders. The effect of RSV on the human adipokine profile is still elusive. Therefore, a proteomic study together with bioinformatical analysis was performed to investigate the effect of RSV on the secretion profile of mature human SGBS adipocytes. RSV incubation resulted in elevated basal glycerol release and reduced intracellular TG content. This increased intracellular lipolysis was accompanied by profound changes in the adipocyte secretion profile. Extracellular matrix proteins were down-regulated while processing proteins were mostly up-regulated after RSV treatment. Interestingly, RSV induced secretion of proteins protective against cellular stress and proteins involved in the regulation of apoptosis. Furthermore, we found a RSV-induced up-regulation of adiponectin and ApoE accompanied by a down-regulation of PAI-1 and PEDF secretion which may improve anti-inflammatory processes and increased insulin sensitivity. These effects may contribute to alleviate obesity-induced metabolic complications. In addition, two novel RSV-regulated adipocyte-secreted proteins were identified.",

    "abstract": "The sensing by T cells of metabolic and energetic changes in the microenvironment can determine the differentiation, maturation, and activation of these cells. Although it is known that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) gauges nutritonal and energetic signals in the extracellular milieu, it is not known how mTOR and metabolism influence CD4+CD25-FOXP3- effector T cell (Teff) responses. In this article, we show that leptin-induced activation of mTOR, which, in turn, controls leptin production and signaling, causes a defined cellular, biochemical, and transcriptional signature that determine the outcome of Teff responses, both in vitro and in vivo. The blockade of leptin/leptin receptor signaling, induced by genetic means or by starvation, leads to impaired mTOR activity that inhibits the proliferation of Teffs in vivo. Notably, the transcriptional signature of Teffs in the presence of leptin blockade appears similar to that observed in rapamycin-treated Teffs. These results identify a novel link between nutritional status and Teff responses through the leptin-mTOR axis and define a potential target for Teff modulation in normal and pathologic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Zinc-&#x3b1;2-glycoprotein (ZAG) is an adipokine with the potential as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. In this study we show that human ZAG, which is a 41-kDa protein, when administered to ob/ob mice at 50 &#x3bc;g/d(-1) orally in the drinking water produced a progressive loss of body weight (5 g after 8 d treatment), together with a 0.5 C increase in rectal temperature and a 40% reduction in urinary excretion of glucose. There was also a 33% reduction in the area under the curve during an oral glucose tolerance test and an increased sensitivity to insulin. These results were similar to those after iv administration of ZAG. However, tryptic digestion was shown to inactivate ZAG. There was no evidence of human ZAG in the serum but a 2-fold elevation of murine ZAG, which was also observed in target tissues such as white adipose tissue. To determine whether the effect was due to interaction of the human ZAG with the &#x3b2;-adrenergic (&#x3b2;-AR) in the gastrointestinal tract before digestion, ZAG was coadministered to ob/ob mice together with propanolol (40 mg/kg(-1)), a nonspecific &#x3b2;-AR antagonist. The effect of ZAG on body weight, rectal temperature, urinary glucose excretion, improvement in glucose disposal, and increased insulin sensitivity were attenuated by propanolol, as was the increase in murine ZAG in the serum. These results suggest that oral administration of ZAG increases serum levels through interaction with a &#x3b2;-AR in the upper gastrointestinal tract, and gene expression studies showed this to be in the esophagus.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and associated risk factors such as obesity remain at the forefront of health concerns. Adipose tissue has been well established as an endocrine organ that becomes dysfunctional with increased adipose tissue mass.

The identification and characterization of disease-specific proteins within the adipose tissue offers a novel therapeutic target for prevention or treatment of cardiovascular complications. This review will discuss the latest developments on therapeutic targets within the context of adipokines, such as adiponectin, C1q/ tumor necrosis factor (TNF) related proteins (CTRPs), visfatin, vaspin, chemerin and omentin, and their involvement in obesity-related cardiovascular complications.",

    "title": "Adiponectin in diabetes mellitus.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin represents one of the most abundant and well-studied adipokines that has been implicated as a major protective factor against the adverse metabolic and cardiovascular consequences of obesity. The main insulin-sensitizing action of adiponectin results from decrease in hepatic gluconeogenesis and increase in muscle glucose transport and, secondly from enhancement of energy consumption and fatty acid oxidation in peripheral tissues with the aim of increasing ATP production. Besides these effects, the potential role of adiponectin on insulin secretion, as well as on energy expenditure, through central action, has also been investigated. Accumulating evidence from clinical, experimental animal and genetic studies support a close association between hypoadiponectinemia and insulin resistance/ type 2 diabetes. The question that arises is whether hypoadiponectinemia is the result of insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes or the cause of this disorder. Based on the observation that various drug classes exert beneficial effects on insulin resistance partly by increasing plasma adiponectin levels, it could hypothesized that substances that enhance or mimic adiponectin to activate its receptors and/or postreceptor signaling pathway may be a promising therapeutic strategy in the prevention and treatment of diabetes. However, many questions need to be addressed before adiponectin can be used as a potent therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "The antidiabetic and antiatherosclerotic effects of adiponectin make it a desirable drug target for the treatment of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. However, the adiponectin-based drug development approach turns out to be difficult due to extremely high serum levels of this adipokine. On the other hand, a significant correlation between adiponectin multimerization and its insulin-sensitizing effects has been demonstrated, suggesting a promising alternative therapeutic strategy. Here we show that transgenic mice overexpressing disulfide bond A oxidoreductase-like protein in fat (fDsbA-L) exhibited increased levels of total and the high-molecular-weight form of adiponectin compared with wild-type (WT) littermates. The fDsbA-L mice also displayed resistance to diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis compared with WT control mice. The protective effects of DsbA-L overexpression on diet-induced insulin resistance, but not increased body weight and fat cell size, were significantly decreased in adiponectin-deficient fDsbA-L mice (fDsbA-L/Ad(-/-)). In addition, the fDsbA-L/Ad(-/-) mice displayed greater activity and energy expenditure compared with adiponectin knockout mice under a high-fat diet. Taken together, our results demonstrate that DsbA-L protects mice from diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance through adiponectin-dependent and independent mechanisms. In addition, upregulation of DsbA-L could be an effective therapeutic approach for the treatment of obesity and its associated metabolic disorders.",

    "abstract": "It is widely accepted that obesity is a major risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis. In this context, adipose tissue produces a variety of adipokines and releases free fatty acids, contributing to a chronic-low grade inflammation state implicated in vascular complications. In this study, we investigated the role of adipokines, oleic acid (OA), palmitic acid (PA), and the combinations on activation of NF-&#x3ba;B target genes in human vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) to assess the hypothesis of synergistic interactions between these molecules. Adipocyte-conditioned medium (CM), generated from human adipocytes, in combination with low concentrations of OA, but not PA, induces SMC proliferation and activation of the transcription factor NF-&#x3ba;B in a synergistic way. Combined treatment of CM and OA further regulates a set of downstream NF-&#x3ba;B target genes including angiopoietin-1, activin A, and MMP-1, all critically involved in SMC dysfunction. This suggests that the lipotoxic potential of fatty acids is substantially enhanced by the presence of adipocyte-derived factors.",

    "abstract": "Grateloupia lanceolata (Okamura) Kawaguchi is a red alga native to coastal areas of East Asia. The effect of a G. lanceolata extract on lipid accumulation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in 3T3-L1 cells was assessed by examining adipogenic transcription factors and ROS-regulating genes at the molecular level. An ethanol extract of G. lanceolata inhibited lipid accumulation and ROS production during adipogenesis. Treatment with the G. lanceolata extract lead to a reduction in the mRNA levels of the transcription factors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#x3b3; and CCAAT/ enhancer binding protein-&#x3b1;, and at the protein level for the target protein, adipocyte protein 2. ROS-producing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen (NADPH) oxidase 4 and NADPH-producing glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNAs decreased following G. lanceolata extract treatment. In contrast, the mRNA level of ROS scavenging enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase, and catalase increased in the extract-treated group. The increase in SOD1 (Cu/Zn-SOD) and 2 (Mn-SOD) proteins was correlated with their mRNA levels. Additionally, the G. lanceolata extract significantly enhanced mRNA levels of adiponectin, one of the adipokines secreted from adipocytes. Our results show that G. lanceolata extract inhibited lipid accumulation and ROS production by controlling adipogenic signals and ROS regulating genes.",

    "abstract": "Blockade of opioidergic neurotransmission contributes to reduction in body weight. However, how such blockade affects body weight gain (BWG) attributed to second generation antipsychotic agents (SGAs) has not yet been established. Here we examined the effects of an opioid receptor antagonist, naltrexone (NTX), on food intake and BWG associated with an SGA, olanzapine (OL). Four groups of Wistar Han IGS rats were treated for 28 days with either OL (2 mg/kg twice daily, intraperitoneal (IP)), a combination of OL (2 mg/kg twice daily, IP) + extended-release NTX (50 mg/kg, one-time, intramuscular (IM)), extended-release NTX (50 mg/kg, one-time, IM) or vehicle and their food intake and body weight were measured daily for the first nine days and every other day thereafter. Food intake and BWG that were increased by OL were decreased by the added NTX while NTX alone had no significant effects on food intake or on BWG. Plasma leptin concentrations were significantly elevated in the three groups receiving pharmacological agents, but did not differ among each other, suggesting that changes in leptin secretion and/or clearance alone would not explain the food intake and the body weight findings. Our results extend prior reports on anorexigenic effects of opioid antagonists by demonstrating that such effects may generalize to food intake increases and BWG arising in the context of OL pharmacotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Leptin receptor (LepRb) signaling in the hindbrain is required for energy balance control. Yet the specific hindbrain neurons and the behavioral processes mediating energy balance control by hindbrain leptin signaling are unknown. Studies here employ genetic [adeno-associated virally mediated RNA interference (AAV-RNAi)] and pharmacological methodologies to specify the neurons and the mechanisms through which hindbrain LepRb signaling contributes to the control of food intake. Results show that AAV-RNAi-mediated LepRb knockdown targeting a region encompassing the mNTS and area postrema (AP) (mNTS/AP LepRbKD) increases overall cumulative food intake by increasing the size of spontaneous meals. Other results show that pharmacological hindbrain leptin delivery and RNAi-mediated mNTS/AP LepRb knockdown increased and decreased the intake-suppressive effects of intraduodenal nutrient infusion, respectively. These meal size and intestinally derived signal amplification effects are likely mediated by LepRb signaling in the mNTS and not the AP, since 4th icv and mNTS parenchymal leptin (0.5 &#x3bc;g) administration reduced food intake, whereas this dose did not influence food intake when injected into the AP. Overall, these findings deepen the understanding of the distributed neuronal systems and behavioral mechanisms that mediate the effects of leptin receptor signaling on the control of food intake.",

    "abstract": "Cirsium japonicum flavones have been demonstrated to possess anti-diabetic effects in diabetic rats, but the functional mechanism remains unknown. The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x3b3; (PPAR&#x3b3;) plays an important role in glucose and lipid homeostasis. In this study, we report the effects of Cirsium japonicum flavones (pectolinarin and 5,7-dihydroxy-6,4-dimethoxy flavone) on PPAR&#x3b3; activation, adipocyte differentiation, and glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 cells. Reporter gene assays and Oil Red O staining showed that Cirsium japonicum flavones induced PPAR&#x3b3; activation and enhanced adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, Cirsium japonicum flavones increased the expression of PPAR&#x3b3; target genes, such as adiponectin and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), and enhanced the translocation of intracellular GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. In mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes, Cirsium japonicum flavones significantly enhanced the basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. The flavones-induced effects in 3T3-L1 cells were abolished by the PPAR&#x3b3; antagonist, GW9662, and by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, wortmannin. This study suggests that Cirsium japonicum flavones promote adipocyte differentiation and glucose uptake by inducing PPAR&#x3b3; activation and then modulating the insulin signaling pathway in some way, which could benefit diabetes patients.",

    "abstract": "Hyperglycemia is commonly observed in extremely low gestational age newborns (ELGANs) and is associated with both increased morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between neonatal hyperglycemia and adiponectin levels in ELGANs. Ten preterm infants between 22+6/7 and 27+3/7 weeks' gestation with neonatal hyperglycemia (defined as pre-feeding blood glucose levels above 200mg/dl on two consecutive measurements with a maximum parenteral glucose infusion of 4 mg/kg*min(-1)) formed the case cohort of this study. To every single patient of this case cohort a patient with normal fasting ( = pre-feeding) blood glucose levels was matched in terms of gestational age and gender. Adiponectin ELISAs were performed both at onset of hyperglycemia and at term-equivalent age. In the case cohort 9/10 patients had to be treated with insulin for 1-26 days (range 0.01-0.4 IU/kg*h(-1)). Compared to matched-paired controls, significant hypoadiponectinemia was observed at onset of hyperglycemia in these affected patients (6.9 &#xb5;g/ml versus 15.1 &#xb5;g/ml, p = 0.009). At term equivalent age, normoglycemia without any insulin treatment was found in both groups. Moreover, adiponectin levels at that time were no longer significantly different (12.3 &#xb5;g/ml versus 20.0 &#xb5;g/ml; p = 0.051) possibly indicating a mechanistic relevance of this adipokine in regulating insulin sensitivity in ELGANs. Decreased circulating adiponectin levels are correlated with hyperglycemia in ELGANs and may contribute to the pathogenesis of impaired glucose homeostasis in these infants. These findings suggest that adiponectin might be a potential future drug target for the potentially save treatment of hyperglycemia in pre-term infants.",

    "abstract": "Insulin resistance (IR) is the major driving force behind development and progression of atherosclerosis in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Therefore, correction of IR is a relevant therapeutic target.We performed the current trial to evaluate whether 12- month metformin therapy improves vascular stiffness in patients with NAFLD and to assess if this improvement is associated with change in glucose control, insulin resistance or circulating adiponectin. In randomized, placebo controlled study, 63 patients with NAFLD were assigned to one of two groups: Group 1 received daily metformin; Group 2 received placebo. Central aortic augmentation index (AI) was performed using SphygmoCor (version 7.1, AtCor Medical, Sydney, Australia) at baseline, at 4-and 12-month treatment period. Metabolic parameters, insulin resistance markers and serum adiponectin levels were determined. In placebo group: AI did not improve during the treatment period. Liver function and adiponectin levels did not change during the study.In multiple linear regression analysis, the independent predictors of arterial stiffness improvement were metformin treatment and increase in circulating adiponectin levels.Among metformin treated patients: AI decreased significantly during the study. ALP and ALT decreased during initial 4-month treatment period, however raised to the pretreatment levels after 12&#x2009;months. Serum adiponectin level tended to increase during treatment period with metformin. Metformin treatment was associated with significant decrease in AI during one year treatment in NAFLD patients. These beneficial vascular effects was associated with exposure to metformin per se as well as change in adiponectin levels suggesting that metformin may mediate its vascular effects via glycemic control-independent mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Lipoic acid (LA) is an antioxidant with antiobesity and antidiabetic properties. Adiponectin is an adipokine with potent anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing properties. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key enzyme involved in cellular energy homeostasis. Activation of AMPK has been considered as a target to reverse the metabolic abnormalities associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of LA on AMPK phosphorylation and adiponectin production in adipose tissue of low-fat (control diet) and high-fat diet-fed rats. Dietary supplementation with LA reduced body weight and adiposity in control and high-fat-fed rats. LA also reduced basal hyperinsulinemia as well as the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) levels, an index of insulin resistance, in high-fat-fed rats, which was in part independent of their food intake lowering actions. Furthermore, AMPK phosphorylation was increased in white adipose tissue (WAT) from LA-treated rats as compared with pair-fed animals. Dietary supplementation with LA also upregulated adiponectin gene expression in WAT, while a negative correlation between adiposity-corrected adiponectin levels and HOMA index was found. Our present data suggest that the ability of LA supplementation to prevent insulin resistance in high-fat diet-fed rats might be related in part to the stimulation of AMPK and adiponectin in WAT.",

    "abstract": "The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) has been reported to decrease insulin resistance even during pregnancy, while exposure to a high-fat diet (HFD) in utero in mice can induce a type 2 diabetes phenotype that can be transmitted to the progeny. Therefore, we examined whether treatment with a CAR ligand during pregnancy could prevent hypertension, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia in the offspring from HFD-induced obese pregnant mice (OH mice). We employed four groups of offspring from HFD-fed and control diet-fed pregnant mice with or without treatment with a CAR ligand. Treatment with a CAR ligand during pregnancy improved glucose tolerance and the levels of triglyceride and adipocytokine and restored the changes induced by HFD with amelioration of hypertension in the adult OH mice. This treatment also increased adiponectin mRNA expression, suppressed leptin expression in adipose tissues of OH mice, and abolished the effect of HFD on the epigenetic modifications of the genes encoding adiponectin and leptin in the offspring during immaturity and adulthood. Our data suggest that CAR might be a potential therapeutic target to prevent metabolic syndrome in adulthood of offspring exposed to an HFD in utero.",

    "title": "Leptin and aldosterone in sympathetic activity in resistant hypertension with or without type 2 diabetes.",
    "abstract": "The finding of adipocyte-derived hormone leptin as an overstimulator of sympathetic activity brought a new perspective to the pathophysiological mechanisms of obesity-hypertension. As aldosterone also increases sympathetic activity, we aimed to assess the relationship between sympathetic overactivity and plasma leptin and aldosterone levels in resistant hypertension (RHTN), comparing the groups with and without T2D. Twenty-five RHTN patients underwent ambulatory electrocardiography to analyze heart rate variability (HRV) in time and frequency domains, which were stratified into two periods: 24 hours and daytime (DT), comprising the records between 2:00 p.m to 6:00 p.m (time domain) and one hour at 3:00 p.m (frequency domain). T2D group (n=10) had higher serum aldosterone and plasma leptin levels than the non-T2D (n=15) (26.0 &#xb1; 11.5 vs. 16.9 &#xb1; 7.0 ng/dL - p=0.021; 81.368.7 &#xb1; 47.086.1 vs 41.228.1 &#xb1; 24.523.1 pg/mL - p=0.048, respectively). Both groups had aldosterone correlated with HRV in frequency domain. Non-T2D had aldosterone correlated with DT low frequency in normalized units (LF nu) (r=0.6 [0.12-0.85] p=0.018) and DT high frequency in normalized units (HF nu) (r=-0.6 [-0.85- -0.12] p=0.018). Type-2-diabetes group had aldosterone correlated with DT LF nu (r=0.72 [0.16-0.93] p=0.019) and DT HF nu (r=-0.72 [-0.93- -0.16] p=0.019). However, despite of the importance of leptin in sympathetic overactivity in hypertension, leptin did not correlate with HRV. Aldosterone seems to overdrive sympathetic activity in RHTN with and without T2D. This information combined with the clinical efficacy of mineralocorticoid receptor blocker in RHTN may reinforce that aldosterone is a major player to be a therapeutic target in RHTN.",

    "title": "Leucine improves glucose and lipid status in offspring from obese dams, dependent on diet type, but not caloric intake.",
    "abstract": "Previously, we showed that offspring from obese rat dams were hyperphagic, with increased adiposity, hyperlipidaemia and glucose intolerance associated with increased orexigenic neuropeptide expression after fasting. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) can inhibit food intake through a hypothalamic action. As we previously showed that maternal obesity down-regulated hypothalamic mTOR, in the present study, we hypothesised that dietary leucine supplementation would activate hypothalamic mTOR to reduce food intake, thus limiting metabolic disorders in offspring from obese dams, regardless of postweaning diet. Obesity was induced in Sprague-Dawley females by high-fat diet (HFD) for 5&#x2003;weeks before mating, throughout gestation and lactation. Male pups from HFD-fed mothers were weaned onto chow or HFD; within each dietary group, half were supplied with leucine via drinking water (1.5%) versus water control for 10&#x2003;weeks. Those from chow-fed mothers were fed chow and water. Maternal obesity led to increased adiposity in chow-fed offspring. Postweaning HFD consumption exaggerated adiposity, hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinaemia and hyperlipidaemia. Supplementation with leucine doubled leucine intake and increased hypothalamic mTOR activation; however, appetite regulation was not affected. A reduction in blood lipid levels was observed in offspring regardless of diet, as well as improved glucose tolerance in HFD-fed rats. In HFD-fed rats, up-regulated carnitine palmitoyl-transferase-1 and peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-&#x3b3; coactivator-1&#x3b1; in muscle and glucose transporter 4 in fat suggested that leucine improved peripheral fat oxidation and glucose transport. Leucine is able to improve peripheral glucose and lipid metabolism independent of appetite and weight regulation, suggesting its potential application in the management of metabolic disorders.",

    "title": "A novel pro-inflammatory mechanism of action of resistin in human endothelial cells: up-regulation of SOCS3 expression through STAT3 activation.",
    "abstract": "Resistin is a significant local and systemic regulatory cytokine involved in inflammation. Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins are intracellular regulators of receptor signal transduction induced by several cytokines in a cytokine and cell specific manner. Resistin up-regulates SOCS3 expression in mice adipocytes but it is not known whether this is a common occurrence in other cells. We questioned whether resistin-induces SOCS3 in human endothelial cells and if signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins are involved in the process. The Real-Time PCR and Western blot analysis showed that in resistin-activated HEC the gene and protein expression of SOCS3 were significantly increased. Furthermore, resistin induced activation of STAT3 as characterized by increased tyrosine phosphorylation. Resistin-induced SOCS3 expression was blocked by specific inhibitors of STAT3 signaling and by the transfection of siRNA specific for STAT3. Silencing of SOCS3 gene expression by transfection with SOCS3 siRNA reduced the expression of resistin induced-P-selectin and fractalkine in HEC. Together, our results demonstrate that in HEC (1) resistin up-regulates SOCS3 expression and activates STAT3 transcription factor; (2) the increase in SOCS3 mRNA and protein expression as well as STAT3 activation have a long-lasting effect (up to 18h); (3) inhibition of SOCS3 function prevents resistin-induced expression of cell adhesion molecules P-selectin and fractalkine and thus activation of endothelial cells. The data uncover a new resistin-mediated mechanism in human endothelial cells and designate SOCS3 as a novel therapeutic target to modulate resistin-dependent inflammation in vessel wall diseases.",

    "title": "Discovery of a new role of human resistin in hepatocyte low-density lipoprotein receptor suppression mediated in part by proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9.",
    "abstract": "In this study, our goal was to determine if human resistin plays a role in regulating the uptake of atherogenic low-density lipoproteins in human hepatocytes. Serum levels of resistin, an adipose tissue-derived adipokine, are increased in human obesity and are positively correlated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. However, the function of resistin in humans is enigmatic. Human hepatocytes (HepG2 and primary) were treated (24 h) with the following: 1) purified human resistin at various concentrations, with and without lovastatin; and 2) obese human serum with elevated resistin levels or serum from which resistin was removed via antibody-immunoprecipitation. The effect of the treatments on cellular low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) messenger ribonucleic acid and protein levels were determined by using real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, respectively. Resistin, at physiological levels observed in human obesity, down-regulated hepatocyte LDLR expression substantially (by 40%). A key mechanism by which human resistin inhibited LDLR levels was by increased cellular expression of the recently identified protease, PCSK9, which enhances intracellular LDLR lysosomal degradation. The quantitatively important role of human resistin in LDLR expression was demonstrated by antibody-immunoprecipitation removal of resistin in human serum, which decreased serum stimulation of hepatocyte LDLRs markedly (by 80%). Furthermore, resistin diminished statin-mediated up-regulation of the LDLR by 60%, implicating resistin in the relative ineffectiveness of statins in selective target populations. These results reveal for the first time that resistin is a highly attractive therapeutic target in ameliorating elevated serum low-density lipoprotein and, thereby, atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases in obese humans.",

    "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a chronic disease characterized by bone loss and increased skeletal fragility. Large animal models are required for preclinical testing of new therapeutic approaches. We have recently demonstrated that continuous intracerebroventricular (ICV) application of leptin into the lateral ventricle (LV) induces bone loss in ewe. On the basis of these findings, we reasoned that the third ventricle (TV) is an even better target because of its closer location to the hypothalamus that mediates leptin effects on bone. Corriedale sheep were randomly mixed to four groups of four ewe each: control entire (control), ovarectomy plus ICV application of cerebrospinal fluid (OVX), OVX plus ICV application of leptin into the LV (leptin-LV); and ICV application of leptin into the TV (leptin-TV). After 3 months, histomorphometric characterization and bone turnover parameters were analyzed. Highly significant loss of trabecular bone was observed only in leptin-LV group. Increased osteoclast indices and urinary cross-lap excretion were observed in OVX and leptin-TV group. In contrast, serum parameters of osteoblast activity were only significantly decreased in leptin-LV group. Autopsy of ewe brain showed fibrosis around the stainless steel cannula in leptin-TV group. ICV application of leptin into the LV strongly reduces bone formation and leads to a highly significant trabecular bone loss in ewe. In contrast, ICV application of leptin into the TV is technically more demanding and results are unpredictable, because the required use of stainless steel cannula induces peri-implant fibrosis that might prevent leptin to enter the cerebrospinal fluid.",

    "abstract": "It is important to identify the multiple sites of leptin activity in obese women with breast cancer. In this study, we examined the effect of exogenous human leptin on heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) expression in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and in a breast carcinoma xenograft model of nude mice. We cultured MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and established nude mice bearing xenografts of these cells, and randomly divided them into experimental and control groups. The experimental group was treated with human leptin, while the control group was treated with the same volume of normal saline. A real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was developed to quantify the mRNA expression of HSP70 in the MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and in tumor tissues. Western blotting analysis was applied to quantify the protein expression of HSP70 in the MCF-7 cells. Immunohistochemical staining was done to assess the positive rate of HSP70 expression in the tumor tissues. Leptin activated HSP70 in a dose-dependent manner in vitro: leptin upregulated significantly the expression of HSP70 at mRNA and protein levels in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells (P &lt; 0.001). There was no significant difference in expression of HSP70 mRNA in the implanted tumors between the leptin-treated group and the control group (P &gt; 0.05). Immunohistochemical staining revealed no significant difference in tumor HSP70 expression between the leptin-treated group and the control group (P &gt; 0.05). A nude mouse xenograft model can be safely and efficiently treated with human leptin by subcutaneous injections around the tumor. HSP70 may be target of leptin in breast cancer. Leptin can significantly upregulate the expression of HSP70 in a dose-dependent manner in vitro.",

    "title": "Role of leptin in the pancreatic &#x3b2;-cell: effects and signaling pathways.",
    "abstract": "Leptin plays an important role in the control of food intake, energy expenditure, metabolism, and body weight. This hormone also has a key function in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. Although leptin acts through central and peripheral mechanisms to modulate glucose metabolism, the pancreatic &#x3b2;-cell of the endocrine pancreas is a critical target of leptin actions. Leptin receptors are present in the &#x3b2;-cell, and their activation directly inhibits insulin secretion from these endocrine cells. The effects of leptin on insulin occur also in the long term, since this hormone inhibits insulin gene expression as well. Additionally, &#x3b2;-cell mass can be affected by leptin through changes in proliferation, apoptosis, or cell size. All these different functions in the &#x3b2;-cell are triggered by leptin as a result of the large diversity of signaling pathways that this hormone is able to activate in the endocrine pancreas. Therefore, leptin can participate in glucose homeostasis owing to different levels of modulation of the pancreatic &#x3b2;-cell population. Furthermore, it has been proposed that alterations in this level of regulation could contribute to the impairment of &#x3b2;-cell function in obesity states. In the present review, we will discuss all these issues with special emphasis on the effects and pathways of leptin signaling in the pancreatic &#x3b2;-cell.",

    "title": "Effects of rilpivirine on human adipocyte differentiation, gene expression, and release of adipokines and cytokines.",
    "abstract": "Rilpivirine is a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) recently developed as a drug of choice for initial antiretroviral treatment of HIV-1 infection. Disturbances in lipid metabolism and, ultimately, in adipose tissue distribution and function are common concerns as secondary effects of antiretroviral treatment. Efavirenz, the most commonly used NNRTI, causes mild dyslipidemic effects in patients and strongly impaired adipocyte differentiation in vitro. In this study, we provide the first demonstration of the effects of rilpivirine on human adipocyte differentiation, gene expression, and release of regulatory proteins (adipokines and cytokines) and compare them with those caused by efavirenz. Rilpivirine caused a repression of adipocyte differentiation that was associated with impaired expression of the master adipogenesis regulators peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR&#x3b3;), CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBP&#x3b1;), and sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBP-1) and their target genes encoding lipoprotein lipase and the adipokines leptin and adiponectin. Rilpivirine also repressed adiponectin release by adipocytes, but only at high concentrations, and did not alter leptin release. Rilpivirine induced the release of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 and -8, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 [MCP-1], plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 [PAI-1]) only at very high concentrations (10 &#x3bc;M). A comparison of the effects of rilpivirine and efavirenz at the same concentration (4 &#x3bc;M) or even at lower concentrations of efavirenz (2 &#x3bc;M) showed that rilpivirine-induced impairment of adipogenesis and induction of proinflammatory cytokine expression and release were systematically milder than those of efavirenz. It is concluded that rilpivirine causes an antiadipogenic and proinflammatory response pattern, but only at high concentrations, whereas efavirenz causes similar effects at lower concentrations.",

We have crystallized the Fab fragment of&#xa0;a leptin-blocking monoclonal antibody (9F8), both in its uncomplexed state and bound to the leptin-binding domain (LBD) of human ObR. We describe the structure of the LBD-9F8 Fab complex and the conformational changes in 9F8 associated with LBD binding. A molecular model of the putative leptin-LBD complex reveals that 9F8 Fab blocks leptin binding through only a small (10%) overlap in their binding sites, and that leptin binding is likely to involve an induced fit mechanism. This crystal structure of the leptin-binding domain of the obesity receptor will facilitate the design of therapeutics to modulate leptin signaling.",

    "title": "Evidence that contamination by lipopolysaccharide confounds in vitro studies of adiponectin activity in bone.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin, a hormone produced and secreted from adipose tissue, circulates at levels that are inversely related to visceral fat mass and bone mineral density. Adiponectin receptors are expressed in bone cells, and several studies have shown that adiponectin affects bone phenotype and might play a role in the cross talk between fat and bone tissues. In the current study, we determined global changes in gene expression induced by adiponectin in mouse bone marrow cells, in order to identify the molecular mechanisms that mediate adiponectin's effect to inhibit osteoclast differentiation in these cultures. The gene signature that was produced by microarray analysis was very similar to a signature produced by activation of type I interferons (IFN), and we therefore tested the hypothesis that the adiponectin preparation, although marketed as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) free, was contaminated with LPS that induced an IFN response in the bone marrow cells. Heat inactivation of the adiponectin preparation and the use of small interfering RNA to knockdown the AdipoR1 receptor had not diminished the activity of the adiponectin preparation to induce the IFN target genes Ccl5 and Irf7. Thus, the changes in gene expression determined in the bone marrow cultures are likely to be the result of a combination of adiponectin and LPS effects. Our study suggests that the purity of commercially available proteins needs to be verified and that experimental results of adiponectin activity in vitro should be interpreted cautiously.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin has been receiving a great deal of attention due to its potential therapeutic use for metabolic and cardiovascular disorders. Adiponectin expression levels and multimerization are down-regulated in obesity and up-regulated by insulin sensitizers such as thiazolidinediones (TZDs), metformin, sulfonylurea and resveratrol (RSV). The precise mechanisms underlying adiponectin up- and down-regulation remain largely unknown, but recent studies indicate that the cellular and plasma levels of adiponectin could be regulated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. At the post-translational level, TZDs and resveratrol promote adiponectin levels and multimerization via up-regulation of disulfide-bond-A oxidoreductase-like protein (DsbA-L). Adiponectin levels are also stimulated by FOXO1 and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and are suppressed by PKA or silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT). Since multimerization is important not only for adiponectin function but also for stability, increasing adiponectin multimerization has become a promising drug target for the treatment of metabolic diseases and other related disorders.",

    "abstract": "Leptin enhances insulin sensitivity in addition to reducing food intake and body weight. Recently, amylin, a pancreatic &#x3b2;-cell-derived hormone, was shown to restore a weight-reducing effect of leptin in leptin-resistant diet-induced obesity. However, whether amylin improves the effect of leptin on insulin sensitivity in diet-induced obesity is unclear. Diet-induced obese (DIO) mice were infused with either saline (S), leptin (L; 500 &#x3bc;g&#xb7;kg&#x207b;&#xb9;&#xb7;day&#x207b;&#xb9;), amylin (A; 100 &#x3bc;g&#xb7;kg&#x207b;&#xb9;&#xb7;day&#x207b;&#xb9;), or leptin plus amylin (L/A) for 14 days using osmotic minipumps. Food intake, body weight, metabolic parameters, tissue triglyceride content, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity were examined. Pair-feeding and weight-matched calorie restriction experiments were performed to assess the influence of food intake and body weight reduction. Continuous L/A coadministration significantly reduced food intake, increased energy expenditure, and reduced body weight, whereas administration of L or A alone had no effects. L/A coadministration did not affect blood glucose levels during ad libitum feeding but decreased plasma insulin levels significantly (by 48%), suggesting the enhancement of insulin sensitivity. Insulin tolerance test actually showed the increased effect of insulin in L/A-treated mice. In addition, L/A coadministration significantly decreased tissue triglyceride content and increased AMPK&#x3b1;2 activity in skeletal muscle (by 67%). L/A coadministration enhanced insulin sensitivity more than pair-feeding and weight-matched calorie restriction. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the beneficial effect of L/A coadministration on glucose and lipid metabolism in DIO mice, indicating the possible clinical usefulness of L/A coadministration as a new antidiabetic treatment in obesity-associated diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin is an abundant plasma protein secreted from adipocytes. Its role in energy homeostasis is well-known, including the regulation of hydrocarbons and lipids metabolism as well as the improvement of insulin resistance. It has been thought to be a key molecule in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome, which are epidemiological targets for preventing cardiovascular disease. In addition to beneficial metabolic effects, adiponectin seems to have anti-inflammatory, anti-atherosclerotic and vasoprotective actions. Furthermore, adiponectin affects signalling in myocardial cells and exerts beneficial actions on the heart after pressure overload and ischemia-reperfusion injury. The ability of adiponectin to reduce insulin resistance in conjunction with its antiinflammatory and cardioprotective properties makes this adipocytokine a promising therapeutic target. On clinical interest, agents that enhance endogenous adiponectin production or action have potential for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Management strategies that increase adiponectin levels include weight reduction, Mediterranean diet, thiazolidinediones, antihypertensive and lipid lowering drugs. Current knowledge on the main actions of adiponectin and therapeutic approaches for cardiovascular disease is summarized in this review.",

    "abstract": "The physiological control of feeding behavior involves modulation of the intake inhibitory effects of gastrointestinal satiation signaling via endogenous hindbrain leptin receptor (LepR) and glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) activation. Using a variety of dose-combinations of hindbrain delivered (4th intracerebroventricular; i.c.v.) leptin and the GLP-1R agonist exendin-4, experiments demonstrate that hindbrain LepR and GLP-1R signaling interact to control food intake and body weight in an additive manner. In addition, the maximum intake suppressive response that could be achieved by 4th i.c.v. leptin alone in non-obese rats (&#x223c;33%) was shown to be further suppressed when exendin-4 was co-administered. Importantly, it was determined that the interaction between hindbrain LepR signaling and GLP-1R signaling is relevant to endogenous food intake control, as hindbrain GLP-1R blockade by the selective antagonist exendin-(9-39) attenuated the intake inhibitory effects of hindbrain leptin delivery. Collectively, the findings reported here show that hindbrain LepR and GLP-1R activation interact in at least an additive manner to control food intake and body weight. As evidence is accumulating that combination pharmacotherapies offer greater sustained food intake and body weight suppression in obese individuals when compared with mono-drug therapies or lifestyle modifications alone, these findings highlight the need for further examination of combined central nervous system GLP-1R and LepR signaling as a potential drug target for obesity treatment.",

    "abstract": "Adipose tissue secretes adipokines that mediate insulin resistance, a characteristic feature of obesity and type 2 diabetes. By differential proteome analysis of cellular models of insulin resistance, we identified progranulin (PGRN) as an adipokine induced by TNF-&#x3b1; and dexamethasone. PGRN in blood and adipose tissues was markedly increased in obese mouse models and was normalized with treatment of pioglitazone, an insulin-sensitizing agent. Ablation of PGRN (Grn(-/-)) prevented mice from high fat diet (HFD)-induced insulin resistance, adipocyte hypertrophy, and obesity. Grn deficiency blocked elevation of IL-6, an inflammatory cytokine, induced by HFD in blood and adipose tissues. Insulin resistance induced by chronic administration of PGRN was suppressed by neutralizing IL-6 in vivo. Thus, PGRN is a key adipokine that mediates HFD-induced insulin resistance and obesity through production of IL-6 in adipose tissue, and may be a promising therapeutic target for obesity.",

    "title": "Role of PPARg2 transcription factor in thiazolidinedione-induced insulin sensitization.",
    "abstract": "Adipose tissue is the key regulator of energy balance, playing an active role in lipid storage and metabolism and may be a dynamic buffer to control fatty acid flux. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma isoform-2 (PPARg2), an isoform of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, has been implicated in almost all aspects of human metabolic alterations such as obesity, insulin resistance, type-2 diabetes and dyslipidaemia. The PPARg2 isoform is highly present in adipose tissue where it functions as a thrifty phenotype, which promotes adipocyte differentiation and triglyceride storage. Thiazolidinediones, antidiabetic drugs, induce insulin sensitivity by controlling adipokines. The thiazolidinediones bind with PPARg2 in adipocytes and exert an agonist effect by enhancing adipogenesis and fatty acid uptake. Thiazolidinediones stimulate PPARg2, by which they down-regulate tumour necrosis factor-&#x3b1;, leptin, interleukin-6 and plasminogen and also enhance insulin sensitivity. The aim of this work is to define role of PPARg2 transcription factor in thiazolidinedione-induced insulin sensitization. The PPARg2 alters the transcription of the target gene. This altered gene transcription results in the up-regulation of insulin-sensitizing factors and down-regulation of insulin-resistant factors. The variant Pro12Ala of the PPARg2 gene is an important modulator in metabolic control in the body. Thiazolidinediones stimulate PPARg2 transcription factor by which PPARg2 binds to responsive elements located in the promoter regions of many genes and modulates their transcriptive activity. There is a strong mutual relationship between receptor binding and agonism, which is evidence of the insulin-sensitizing target of thiazolidinediones in PPARg2. This evidently increases the biological potency of the glucose-lowering effect of thiazolidinediones in vivo as well as their antidiabetic activity. PPARg2 transcription factor plays an important role in treatment of type-2 diabetes with thiazolidindiones. The variant Pro12Ala of the PPARg2 gene promotes the activity of thiazolidinediones in minimizing insulin resistance. Transcriptional activity of Pro12Ala variant improves the activity of insulin. Thus thiazolidinediones promote the phosphorylation of PPARg2 to induce insulin sensitivity.",

    "title": "The multi-level action of fatty acids on adiponectin production by fat cells.",
    "abstract": "Current epidemics of diabetes mellitus is largely caused by wide spread obesity. The best-established connection between obesity and insulin resistance is the elevated and/or dysregulated levels of circulating free fatty acids that cause and aggravate insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and other hazardous metabolic conditions. Here, we investigated the effect of a major dietary saturated fatty acid, palmitate, on the insulin-sensitizing adipokine adiponectin produced by cultured adipocytes. We have found that palmitate rapidly inhibits transcription of the adiponectin gene and the release of adiponectin from adipocytes. Adiponectin gene expression is controlled primarily by PPAR&#x3b3; and C/EBP&#x3b1;. Using mouse embryonic fibroblasts from C/EBP&#x3b1;-null mice, we have determined that the latter transcription factor may not solely mediate the inhibitory effect of palmitate on adiponectin transcription leaving PPAR&#x3b3; as a likely target of palmitate. In agreement with this model, palmitate increases phosphorylation of PPAR&#x3b3; on Ser273, and substitution of PPAR&#x3b3; for the unphosphorylated mutant Ser273Ala blocks the effect of palmitate on adiponectin transcription. The inhibitory effect of palmitate on adiponectin gene expression requires its intracellular metabolism via the acyl-CoA synthetase 1-mediated pathway. In addition, we found that palmitate stimulates degradation of intracellular adiponectin by lysosomes, and the lysosomal inhibitor, chloroquine, suppressed the effect of palmitate on adiponectin release from adipocytes. We present evidence suggesting that the intracellular sorting receptor, sortilin, plays an important role in targeting of adiponectin to lysosomes. Thus, palmitate not only decreases adiponectin expression at the level of transcription but may also stimulate lysosomal degradation of newly synthesized adiponectin.",

In addition, leptin treatment resulted in phosphorylation of Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription 3 (STAT3) on Tyr705, the key transcription factor in Janus-Activated Kinase (JAK)/STAT3 signaling pathway.

We took the opportunity afforded by a placebo-controlled trial of smoked medicinal cannabis for HIV-associated neuropathic pain to evaluate the effects of THC on the appetite hormones ghrelin, leptin and PYY, as well as on insulin. In this double-blind cross-over study, each subject was exposed to both active cannabis (THC) and placebo. Compared to placebo, cannabis administration was associated with significant increases in plasma levels of ghrelin and leptin, and decreases in PYY, but did not significantly influence insulin levels. These findings are consistent with modulation of appetite hormones mediated through endogenous cannabinoid receptors, independent of glucose metabolism.",

Furthermore, des-Tyr-soymorphin-5 (PFVV) without &#x3bc;-opioid and anxiolytic-like activities did not decrease blood glucose levels in KKAy mice. These results suggest that &#x3bc;-opioid peptide soymorphin-5 improves glucose and lipid metabolism via activation of the adiponectin and PPAR&#x3b1; system and subsequent increases of &#x3b2;-oxidation and energy expenditure in KKAy mice.",

    "abstract": "Objectives were to determine adipose tissue mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)&#x3b3; co-regulators, target enzymes and transcription regulators, inflammation-related genes, and adipokines in response to dietary long-chain fatty acids (LCFA). From -21 through 10 d relative to parturition cows were fed no supplemental LCFA (control), saturated LCFA (SFAT; mainly 16:0 and 18:0), or fish oil (FO). Lipid was fed at 250 g/d prepartum or approximately 1.5 to 1.9% of the previous day's dry matter intake postpartum. Transcript profiling of 35 genes via quantitative PCR was conducted on biopsies (n=5 cows/diet) collected at -14 and 11 d from parturition. Despite lower dry matter intake with FO, pre- and postpartal blood nonesterified fatty acids, &#x3b2;-hydroxybutyrate, and liver triacylglycerol were unaffected by treatment but increased after calving regardless of diet. Prepartal expression of adipogenic/lipogenic transcription regulators [CEBPA, CEBPB, RXRA, KLF5, and MLXIPL (formerly ChREBP)] and co-regulators (CARM1, EP300, NCOA1, MED1, NCOR2, and NRIP1) was upregulated by FO and SFAT versus control, whereas most enzymes involved in lipogenesis/triacylglycerol synthesis (FASN, SCD, DGAT2, and LPIN1) had greater expression only with FO. Expression of most adipogenic/lipogenic genes decreased after parturition, but feeding SFAT led to sustained upregulation of CEBPA, CEBPB, RXRA, several PPAR-co-activators, and DGAT2 and SCD, suggesting maintenance of a pro-adipogenic/pro-lipogenic state with SFAT. The co-activator CREBBP was greater in cows fed lipid and did not decrease after parturition, suggesting ligand activation of PPAR&#x3b3;. The greater peripartal expression of NFKB1 and TBK1 due to dietary lipid was suggestive of a local inflammatory response. At amounts fed prepartum, both FO and SFAT were effective in upregulating the adipose tissue PPAR&#x3b3;-gene network. In contrast, only SFAT led to sustaining that response. Overall, the observed expression patterns are suggestive of an adipogenic regulatory mechanism particularly responsive to SFAT.",

    "abstract": "An aberrant proliferation of mesangial cells (MCs) is one of the more important features of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Adiponectin, an adipocyte-derived hormone, has been associated with type 2 diabetes, a known cause of DN. Recent studies have suggested that adiponectin has a protective effect on the kidney. To elucidate the potential protective mechanism of adiponectin on kidney, we investigated the effects of adiponectin on platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced cell proliferation and intracellular signaling pathways in cultured Human MCs (HMCs). PDGF-induced HMC proliferation was significantly inhibited by the co-treatment of adiponectin. Adiponectin alone had no effect on HMC proliferation. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and 40&#x2009;S ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) were activated by PDGF stimulation in HMCs. PDGF-induced mTOR and S6K1 phosphorylations were significantly attenuated by the co-treatment of adiponectin in HMC. Adiponectin alone had no effects on PDGF-receptor autophosphorylation by PDGF. We also confirmed that the inhibitory effect of adiponectin on PDGF-induced HMC proliferation was significantly suppressed by compound C, an adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor. From these findings, it is implied that adiponectin could attenuate renal dysfunction associated with MC disorders through AMPK-mTOR signal pathway.",

    "title": "Multiple signal pathways in obesity-associated cancer.",
    "abstract": "Obesity is increasing worldwide and reaches to a large proportion of the population in developed countries. Thus, obesity-associated cancer has become a major health problem. Multiple cancer risk factors in obesity have been identified including insulin/insulin-like growth factor axis, adipokines and cytokines; and multiple intracellular signal pathways have been studied. However, the role of each signal pathway in obesity-associated cancer is controversial. In this review, the recent studies on signal pathways in obesity-associated cancer are summarized and a unified explanation is provided. Multiple risk factors could initially activate phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K/Akt), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathways. With increased severity of obesity, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is down-stream of both PI3K/Akt and MAPK, is highly activated. Activated mTOR in turn inhibits the PI3K/Akt pathway and further activates the STAT3 pathway. This may explain the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway at the early stage of obesity and its inhibition at the later stage. mTOR inhibition may be used for cancer therapy, but it may be necessary to be combined with the PI3K/Akt inhibitor as decreased mTOR activity will release its feedback inhibition on the PI3K/Akt pathway, which is under the influence of multiple cancer risk factors in obesity. Thus, dual inhibitors of PI3K and mTOR may provide a novel approach.",

    "abstract": "We previously described the adipokine CTRP1, which has up-regulated expression following exposure to the anti-diabetic drug rosiglitazone and increased circulating levels in adiponectin-null mice (Wong, G. W., Krawczyk, S. A., Kitidis-Mitrokostas, C., Revett, T., Gimeno, R., and Lodish, H. F. (2008) Biochem. J. 416, 161-177). Although recombinant CTRP1 lowers blood glucose in mice, its physiological function, mechanisms of action, and roles in metabolic stress remain unknown. Here, we show that circulating levels of CTRP1 are strikingly reduced in diet-induced obese mice. Overexpressing CTRP1 in transgenic mice improved insulin sensitivity and decreased high-fat diet-induced weight gain. Reduced adiposity resulted from enhanced fatty acid oxidation and energy expenditure, effects mediated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In skeletal muscle of transgenic mice, AMPK&#x3b1; and its downstream target, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), were hyperphosphorylated, indicative of AMPK activation and ACC inhibition. Inactivation of ACC promotes mitochondrial fat oxidation. Consistent with the direct effect of CTRP1 on AMPK signaling, recombinant CTRP1 administration acutely stimulated muscle AMPK&#x3b1; and ACC phosphorylation in vivo. In isolated soleus muscle, recombinant CTRP1 activated AMPK signaling to increase fatty acid oxidation ex vivo, an effect abrogated by an AMPK inhibitor. These results provide the first in vivo evidence that CTRP1 is a novel regulator of fatty acid metabolism.",

    "title": "Adiponectin receptor-1 expression is associated with good prognosis in gastric cancer.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin is inversely related to BMI, positively correlates with insulin sensitivity, and has anti-atherogenic effects. In recent years, adiponectin has been well studied in the field of oncology. Adiponectin has been shown to have antiproliferative effects on gastric cancer, and adiponectin expression is inversely correlated with clinical staging of the disease. However, no studies have reported the correlation between serum adiponectin and receptor expression with disease progression. In this study, we evaluated expression levels of 2 adiponectin receptors--AdipoR1 and AdipoR2--and attempted to correlate their expression with prognosis in gastric cancer patients. AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 expression in gastric cancer cell lines (MKN45, TMK-1, NUGC3, and NUGC4) was evaluated by western blotting analysis, and the antiproliferative potential of adiponectin was examined in vitro. Serum adiponectin levels were evaluated in 100 gastric cancer patients, and the expression of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 was assessed by immunohistochemical staining. MKN45 and NUGC3 expressed higher levels of AdipoR1 compared to NUGC4, even though there was no significance in AdipoR2 expression. The antiproliferative effect of adiponectin was confirmed in MKN45 and NUGC3 at 10 &#x3bc;g/ml. No significant associations were observed between serum adiponectin levels and clinicopathological characteristics, but lymphatic metastasis and peritoneal dissemination were significantly higher in the negative AdipoR1 immunostaining group (24/32, p = 0.013 and 9/32, p = 0.042, respectively) compared to the positive AdipoR1 group (lymphatic metastasis, 33/68; peritoneal dissemination, 8/68). On the other hand, AdipoR2 expression was only associated with histopathological type (p = 0.001). In survival analysis, the AdipoR1 positive staining group had significantly longer survival rates than the negative staining group (p = 0.01). However, multivariate analysis indicated that AdipoR1 was not an independent prognostic factor on patient's survival on gastric cancer. In gastric cancer, adiponectin has the possibility to be involved in cell growth suppression via AdipoR1. The presence of AdipoR1 could be a novel anticancer therapeutic target in gastric cancer.",

    "abstract": "Lack of estrogen could lead to decreased bone mass and increased risk for osteoporosis, which has a negative influence on biomaterial implantation. Adiponectin (APN), an adipose-derived hormone, has been shown to increase bone density by inhibiting osteoclast formation and promoting the formation of osteoblasts. This study was designed to investigate the direct effects of APN released from the Matrigel controlled-release system on the activity of rabbit mature osteoclasts and osteoclast precursor RAW264.7 cells in vitro, and to determine its effects by improving osteogenesis around the hydroxyapatite (HA) implant in ovariectomized (OVX) rabbits. APN+Matrigel+HA, APN+HA, Matrigel+HA and HA were implanted into mandibular defects of OVX rabbits. At 4 weeks after implantation, the mandibles were examined by histology, microcomputed tomography and biomechanical testing. The results demonstrated that Matrigel extended the length of APN released to achieve long-term persistence. The sustained release of APN suppressed the osteoclastic activity both in vitro and in vivo, and improved the peri-implant osteogenesis in OVX rabbits, while the short-term APN treatment did not. Sustained release of APN may be an effective strategy to improve the restoration of bone defects by the use of HA materials under osteoporotic conditions in which osteoclasts are highly activated.",

    "title": "The therapeutic potential of the adiponectin pathway.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived hormone that has been shown to play an important role in the regulation of metabolic, inflammatory, and apoptotic pathways. Adiponectin improves insulin sensitivity, promotes vascular health, and increases cell survival. These observations suggest a potential therapeutic role for adiponectin in the treatment of diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. However, biologically active recombinant adiponectin proteins are inherently unstable and difficult to produce, thus making it a challenge for both research and clinical development. One main challenge relates to the existence of adiponectin as homo-/hetero-trimers, and complexes containing multiple adiponectin trimer units, in plasma. The underlying mechanism for adiponectin function is also not completely understood. Two receptors for adiponectin (ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2) have been cloned, and activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase (AMPK) has been reported to be downstream of the receptors. Recent findings suggest that adiponectin potently stimulates ceramidase activity via activation of its two known receptors, therefore connecting sphingolipid metabolism to adiponectin functions and providing a potential mechanism explaining the different actions of adiponectin. Interestingly, a new report also identified a pathway involving adiponectin and insulin receptor substrate 2, which is independent of the ADIPOR1/ADIPOR2 pathway. In this manuscript, we will review previous approaches and challenges in exploring adiponectin-based therapeutics. In particular, we will review some of the recent developments in engineering adiponectin proteins as well as potential therapeutic opportunities offered by recently elucidated adiponectin-mediated signaling pathways.",

    "abstract": "Although reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to glucose intolerance induced by the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is well documented, the role of the newly discovered pathway of RAS, angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7)/Mas axis, in this process remains unknown. Here, we examined the effect of Ang-(1-7) on oxidative stress and glucose uptake in adipocytes. We used primary cultured epididymal adipocytes from C57 mice to study Ang-(1-7) effects on glucose uptake. We also treated fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with exogenous Ang-(1-7) or overexpression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to induce endogenous generation of Ang-(1-7) to clarify its effects on ROS production. Intracellular ROS was measured by flow cytometry, dihydroethidium (DHE), and nitroblue tetrazolium assay. Levels of NADPH oxidase and adiponectin mRNA were measured by real-time PCR. Ang-(1-7) improved glucose uptake both in basal and insulin-stimulated states. ROS production was slightly but significantly decreased in adipocytes treated with Ang-(1-7). Additionally, Mas receptor antagonist D-Ala7-Ang-(1-7) (A779) reversed the effect of Ang-(1-7) on glucose uptake and oxidative stress. Furthermore, treatment of adipocytes with Ang-(1-7) decreased NADPH oxidase mRNA levels. We also found that oxidative stress induced by glucose oxidase-suppressed expression of adiponectin, an insulin-sensitive protein. However, the suppression of oxidative stress by Ang-(1-7) restored adiponectin expression, while A779 agonists these changes induced by Ang-(1-7). In conclusion, Ang-(1-7) can protect against oxidative stress and improve glucose metabolism in adipocytes. These results show that Ang-(1-7) is a novel target for the improvement of glucose metabolism by preventing oxidative stress.",

    "abstract": "Rhodococcus equi causes severe pneumonia in foals and has recently gained attention as a significant opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised humans. However, no effective vaccine to prevent rhodococcosis is currently available. In this study, we have engineered the food-grade bacterium Lactococcus lactis to secrete the virulence-associated protein A from R. equi (LL-VapA). The immunogenic potential of LL-VapA strain was then evaluated after either intragastric or intranasal immunization in mice either alone or in combination with LL-Lep, a recombinant strain of L. lactis secreting biologically active leptin, a pleiotropic hormone with significant immunomodulatory properties. Intragastric administration of LL-VapA led to the highest VapA-specific mucosal response whereas intranasal administration led to the highest systemic immune responses. Cytokines released from in vitro-stimulated spleen cells show both a strong IFN-&#x3b3; response and an increase of IL-4 level in all immunized groups, except for the group intranasally co-administered with both LL-VapA and LL-Lep. Strikingly, a significant reduction in R. equi viable counts in liver and spleen was observed four days after intravenous challenge with a virulent strain of R. equi in all immunized groups except for the group vaccinated by intragastric route with LL-VapA. Altogether, our results demonstrate that LL-VapA can evoke a T(H)1-based protective immune response in intranasally immunized mice. This response is enhanced when co-administered with LL-Lep strain, whereas only co-administration of LL-VapA and LL-Lep can induce a protective immune response in intragastric vaccinated mice, associated with a T(H)1/T(H)2 cytokine response.",

    "title": "Adiponectin self-regulates its expression and multimerization in adipose tissue: an autocrine/paracrine mechanism?",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin, a 30-kDa peptide hormone discovered in the mid 1990s, is secreted abundantly and exclusively by adipose tissue. Adiponectin exists in three major forms: a low molecular weight (LMW) trimer, a medium molecular weight (MMW) hexamer, and a high molecular weight (HMW) 18-36 oligomer. The HMW oligomer has the most potent insulin-sensitizing activity therefore impaired adiponectin multimerization may lead to impaired glycemic control. Decreased ratio of HMW/total adiponectin has been observed in patients with obesity, type-2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases and insulin resistance-related metabolic syndrome. Previous studies have indicated that berberine or aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR)-induced activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) suppresses the expression of adiponectin but promotes adiponectin multimerization in adipocytes. Since adiponectin activates AMPK through adiponectin receptors (AdipoRs) in the membranes of adipocytes, we speculate that adiponectin self-regulates its expression and multimerization in adipose tissue. The hypothesis suggests a potential drug target for treating insulin resistance and provides new interpretation of several clinical observations. In addition, we propose a rapid method for one-step detection of the distribution of adiponectin oligomers in approximately 30 min, based on the open sandwich immunoassay and fluorescence resonance energy transfer technology. With the development of this new method, the ratio of HMW/total adiponectin may be applied in clinical diagnosis as a novel biomarker for insulin resistance and metabolic disorders.",

    "abstract": "In order to increase the knowledge on the use of nanoparticles (NPs) in brain targeting, this article describes the conjugation of the sequence 12-32 (g21) of leptin to poly-lactide-co-glycolide NPs. The capability of these modified NPs to reach the brain was evaluated in rats after intravenous administration. The g21 was linked on the surface of NPs labeled with tetramethylrhodamine by means of the Avidin-Biotin technology. The g21-labeled NPs were injected into the tail vein of rats and, after animal sacrifice, the brain localization was evaluated by confocal microscopy, fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy. Studies to evaluate the biodistribution of the g21-modified NPs in comparison to the unmodified NPs were also carried out. Moreover, to confirm the absence of any anorectic effect of g21 linked on the surface of NPs, appropriate studies were used to assess the rats. After intravenous administration, the g21-modified NPs were able to cross the blood-brain barrier and to enter the brain parenchyma. The biodistribution studies of both unmodified and modified NPs pointed out an uptake at liver and spleen level, whereas only the g21-modified NPs showed brain localization. The food-intake experiments pointed out that the intravenous administration of g21 conjugated to the NP surface did not produce any anorectic effect in the rats. g21-modified NPs were able to cross the blood-brain barrier. These new modified NPs could be effectively considered as useful carrier systems for brain drug delivery.",

    "abstract": "The causes of post-restriction hyperphagia (PRH) represent a target for drug-based therapies to prevent obesity. However, the factors causing PRH are poorly understood. We show that, in mice, the extent of PRH was independent of the time under restriction, but depended on its severity, suggesting that PRH was driven by signals from altered body composition. Signals related to fat mass were important drivers. Circulating levels of leptin and TNF&#x3b1; were significantly depleted following caloric restriction (CR). We experimentally repleted their levels to match those of controls, and found that in both treatment groups the level of PRH was significantly blunted. These data establish a role for TNF&#x3b1; and leptin in the non-pathological regulation of energy homeostasis. Signals from adipose tissue, including but not limited to leptin and TNF&#x3b1;, regulate PRH and might be targets for therapies that support people engaged in CR to reduce obesity.",

    "abstract": "A drug delivery system that constitutively and effectively retains cardioprotective reagents in the targeted myocardium has long been sought to treat acute myocardial infarction. We hypothesized that a scaffold-free induced adipocyte cell-sheet (iACS), transplanted on the surface of the heart, might intramyocardially secrete multiple cardioprotective factors including adiponectin (APN), consequently attenuating functional deterioration after acute myocardial infarction. Induced ACS were generated from adipose tissue-derived cells of wild-type (WT) mice (C57BL/6J), which secreted abundant APN, hepatocyte growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor in vitro. Transplanted iACS secreted APN into the myocardium of APN-knockout (KO) mice at 4 weeks. APN was also detected in the plasma of iACS-transplanted APN-KO mice at 3 months (245 &#xb1; 113 pg/mL). After left anterior descending artery ligation, iACS, generated from either WT (n=40) or APN-KO (n=40) mice, were grafted onto the surface of the anterior left ventricular wall of WT mice, or only left anterior descending artery ligation was performed (n=43). Two days later, inflammation and infarct size were significantly diminished only in the WT-iACS treated mice. One month later, cardiomyocyte diameter and percent fibrosis were smaller, whereas ejection fraction and survival were greater in the WT-iACS treated mice compared with the KO-iACS-treated or nontreated mice. Cardioprotective factors including APN, hepatocyte growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor were secreted from iACS. Transplantation of iACS onto the acute myocardial infarction heart attenuated infarct size, inflammation, and left ventricular remodeling, mediated by intramyocardially secreted APN in a constitutive manner. This method might be a novel drug delivery system to treat heart disease.",

    "abstract": "To investigate deep and comprehensive analysis of gut microbial communities and biological parameters after prebiotic administration in obese and diabetic mice. Genetic (ob/ob) or diet-induced obese and diabetic mice were chronically fed with prebiotic-enriched diet or with a control diet. Extensive gut microbiota analyses, including quantitative PCR, pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA, and phylogenetic microarrays, were performed in ob/ob mice. The impact of gut microbiota modulation on leptin sensitivity was investigated in diet-induced leptin-resistant mice. Metabolic parameters, gene expression, glucose homeostasis, and enteroendocrine-related L-cell function were documented in both models. In ob/ob mice, prebiotic feeding decreased Firmicutes and increased Bacteroidetes phyla, but also changed 102 distinct taxa, 16 of which displayed a &gt;10-fold change in abundance. In addition, prebiotics improved glucose tolerance, increased L-cell number and associated parameters (intestinal proglucagon mRNA expression and plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 levels), and reduced fat-mass development, oxidative stress, and low-grade inflammation. In high fat-fed mice, prebiotic treatment improved leptin sensitivity as well as metabolic parameters. We conclude that specific gut microbiota modulation improves glucose homeostasis, leptin sensitivity, and target enteroendocrine cell activity in obese and diabetic mice. By profiling the gut microbiota, we identified a catalog of putative bacterial targets that may affect host metabolism in obesity and diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral satiety sequence (BSS) is a useful paradigm to assess the effects of orexigenic and anorexigenic profiles of novel pharmacological and genetic manipulations in rodents. To date, no studies have described the satiety profile of leptin-deficient ob/ob mice, an important animal model of obesity in this task. Furthermore, no studies have described changes in the BSS after treatment with ghrelin receptor ligands, which have become an attractive therapeutic target in obesity drug discovery efforts. BSS testing was carried out in ob/ob mice and their lean controls. After baseline analysis, effects of ghrelin (2 nmol/10 g) and of the ghrelin receptor antagonist (D-Lys)-GHRP-6 (66.6 and 133.3 nmol/10 g) were studied in BSS in mice of both genotypes. The baseline BSS profile of ob/ob mice showed an increased eating and a decreased resting activity. Ob/ob mice presented with a decreased sensitivity to the stimulation with ghrelin and with the ghrelin receptor antagonist, which caused strong anorexic and adverse side effects in lean mice, thereby disrupting the BSS profile. BSS is an indispensable tool for parsing the role of the ghrelinergic system in satiety, to characterize transgenic mice and to elicit behavioral feeding profiles of novel anorectic agents.",

    "title": "Ethanol-induced oxidative stress via the CYP2E1 pathway disrupts adiponectin secretion from adipocytes.",
    "abstract": "Adipose tissue is an important target for ethanol action. One important effect of ethanol is to reduce the secretion of adiponectin from adipocytes; this decrease is associated with lowered circulating adiponectin in rodent models of chronic ethanol feeding. Adiponectin is an insulin-sensitizing, anti-inflammatory adipokine; decreased adiponectin activity may contribute to tissue injury in response to chronic ethanol. Here, we investigated the role of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and oxidative stress in the mechanism for impaired adiponectin secretion from adipocytes in response to ethanol. Male Wistar rats were fed a liquid diet containing ethanol as 36% of calories or pair-fed a control diet for 4 weeks. 3T3-L1 adipocyte cultures, expressing CYP2E1 or not, were exposed to ethanol or 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). Chronic ethanol feeding to rats suppressed the secretion of adiponectin from isolated epididymal adipocytes. Ethanol feeding induced the expression of CYP2E1 in adipocytes and increased markers of oxidative stress, including 4-HNE and protein carbonyls. Because adiponectin is posttranslationally processed in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, we investigated the impact of ethanol on the redox status of high-density microsomes. Chronic ethanol decreased the ratio of reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione (4.6:1, pair-fed; 2.9:1, ethanol-fed) in high-density microsomes isolated from rat epididymal adipose tissue. We next utilized the 3T3-L1 adipocyte-like cell model to interrogate the mechanisms for impaired adiponectin secretion. Culture of 3T3-L1 adipocytes overexpressing exogenous CYP2E1, but not those overexpressing antisense CYP2E1, with ethanol increased oxidative stress and impaired adiponectin secretion from intracellular pools. Consistent with a role of oxidative stress in impaired adiponectin secretion, challenge of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with 4-HNE also reduced adiponectin mRNA expression and secretion, without affecting intracellular adiponectin concentration. These data demonstrate that CYP2E1-dependent reactive oxygen species production in response to ethanol disrupts adiponectin secretion from adipocytes.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether and by what mechanism systemic delivery of curcumin-containing liposomes improves insulin resistance in the leptin deficient (ob/ob) mouse model of insulin resistance. Insulin resistant ob/ob mice with steatosis were injected intraperitoneally with liposome nanoparticles, entrapping the nuclear factor-&#x3ba;B (NF-&#x3ba;B) inhibitor curcumin (curcusomes), and uptake in liver and adipose tissue was determined by flow cytometry. The effects of curcusomes on macrophage NF-&#x3ba;B activation and cytokine production were assessed. Transfer experiments determined the role of hepatic tumor necrosis factor (TNF)/inducible nitric oxide synthase-producing dendritic cells (Tip-DCs) and adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) in inflammation-induced insulin resistance, determined by homeostatic assessment of insulin resistance. Phagocytic myeloid cells infiltrating the liver in ob/ob mice had the phenotypic characteristics of Tip-DCs that arise from monocyte precursors in the liver and spleen after infection. Targeting Tip-DCs and ATMs with curcusomes in ob/ob mice reduced NF-&#x3ba;B/RelA DNA binding activity, reduced TNF, and enhanced interleukin-4 production. Curcusomes improved peripheral insulin resistance. Both hepatic Tip-DCs and ATMs contribute to insulin resistance in ob/ob mice. Curcusome nanoparticles inhibit proinflammatory pathways in hepatic Tip-DCs and ATMs and reverse insulin resistance. Targeting inflammatory DCs is a novel approach for type 2 diabetes treatment.",

    "abstract": "Leptin is a 16-kDa peptide primarily derived from white adipocytes and is typically elevated in plasma of obese individuals. Although leptin plays a critical role in appetite regulation, leptin receptors have been identified in numerous tissues including the heart and have been shown to directly mediate cardiac hypertrophy through RhoA/ROCK (Ras homolog gene family, member A/Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase)-dependent p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation; however, the basis for RhoA stimulation is unknown. Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP resulting in Rho activation and may be the potential upstream factors mediating leptin-induced RhoA activation and therefore a potential target for inhibition. We investigated the effects of North American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius), reported to reduce cardiac hypertrophy, on RhoA/ROCK and MAPK activation in ventricular cardiomyocytes exposed to leptin (50 ng/ml) and the possible role of p115RhoGEF and p63RhoGEF in these responses. Leptin produced a robust hypertrophic response that was associated with RhoA/ROCK activation resulting in a significant increase in cofilin-2 phosphorylation and actin polymerization, the latter evidenced by a reduction in the G/F actin ratio. These effects were prevented by ginseng (10 &#x3bc;g/ml). The stimulation of RhoA/ROCK by leptin was associated with significantly increased p115RhoGEF gene and protein expression and exchange activity, all of which were completely prevented by ginseng. The ability of ginseng to prevent leptin-induced activation of RhoA/ROCK was further associated with diminished p38 MAPK activation and nuclear translocation. These results demonstrate a potent inhibitory effect of ginseng against leptin-induced cardiac hypertrophy, an effect associated with prevention of p115RhoGEF-RhoA/ROCK-dependent p38 MAPK activation.",

    "abstract": "The satiety hormone leptin plays a cardinal role in the pathophysiology of obesity and diabetes. Here, we show that pharmacological autophagy inducers like rapamycin, spermidine and resveratrol can reduce leptin concentrations in the serum of mice and that genetic inactivation of the leptin/leptin receptor system leads to an increase in autophagy in peripheral tissues including skeletal muscle, heart and liver. Paradoxically, intravenous or intraperitoneal administration of recombinant leptin protein also induced autophagy in these tissues. Moreover, leptin stimulated canonical autophagy in cultured human or mouse cell lines, a phenomenon that was coupled to the activation of adenosine monophosphate-dependent kianse (AMPK), as well as the inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and that was confirmed by autophagic flux measurements. These results suggest that leptin plays an important role in the neuroendocrine control of autophagy, underscoring the existence of novel links between metabolic control and autophagic flux that warrant further in-depth investigation.",

While on a ketogenic diet, the body obtains most of its calories from fat rather than carbohydrates. This dramatic change in caloric composition results in a unique metabolic state. In turn, these changes in caloric composition and metabolism alter some of the neurohormones that participate in the complex neuronal network regulating energy homeostasis. Two observed changes are an increase in serum leptin and a decrease in serum insulin. These opposing changes in leptin and insulin are unique compared to other metabolic stimuli and may modify the activity of several cell signaling cascades including phosphoinositidyl-3 kinase (PI3K), adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). These cell signaling pathways may mediate the anticonvulsant and other beneficial effects of the diet, though the neurohormonal changes induced by the ketogenic diet and the physiological consequences of these changes remain poorly characterized.",

    "abstract": "Enhanced levels of nuclear factor (NF)-&#x3ba;B-inducing kinase (NIK), an upstream kinase in the NF-&#x3ba;B pathway, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation in diabetes. We investigated whether increased levels of NIK could induce skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Six obese subjects with metabolic syndrome underwent skeletal muscle biopsies before and six months after gastric bypass surgery to quantitate NIK protein levels. L6 skeletal myotubes, transfected with NIK wild-type or NIK kinase-dead dominant negative plasmids, were treated with insulin alone or with adiponectin and insulin. Effects of NIK overexpression on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake were estimated using tritiated 2-deoxyglucose uptake. NF-&#x3ba;B activation (EMSA), phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3) kinase activity, and phosphorylation of inhibitor &#x3ba;B kinase &#x3b2; and serine-threonine kinase (Akt) were measured. After weight loss, skeletal muscle NIK protein was significantly reduced in association with increased plasma adiponectin and enhanced AMP kinase phosphorylation and insulin sensitivity in obese subjects. Enhanced NIK expression in cultured L6 myotubes induced a dose-dependent decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. The decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was associated with a significant decrease in PI3 kinase activity and protein kinase B/Akt phosphorylation. Overexpression of NIK kinase-dead dominant negative did not affect insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Adiponectin treatment inhibited NIK-induced NF-&#x3ba;B activation and restored insulin sensitivity by restoring PI3 kinase activation and subsequent Akt phosphorylation. These results indicate that NIK induces insulin resistance and further indicate that adiponectin exerts its insulin-sensitizing effect by suppressing NIK-induced skeletal muscle inflammation. These observations suggest that NIK could be an important therapeutic target for the treatment of insulin resistance associated with inflammation in obesity and type 2 diabetes.",

    "title": "Caloric restriction.",
    "abstract": "Restricting the intake of calories has been practiced as a method for increasing both the length and quality of life for over 500 years. Experimental work confirming the success of this approach in animals has accumulated over the last 100 years. Lifelong caloric restriction (CR) may extend life by up to 50% in rodents, with progressively less impact the later in life it is started. This effect is matched by profound impacts on age related diseases including reduced risk of cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, autoimmune disease, cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes mellitus. The disposable soma theory of ageing suggests that CR evolved as a somatic protection response to enable animals to survive periods of food shortage. The shutdown of reproductive function during CR is consistent with this suggestion, but other features of the phenomenon are less consistent with this theory, and some have suggested that in rodents it may be mostly an artifact of domestication. CR induces profound effects on animals at all levels from the transcriptome to whole animal physiology and behavior. Animals under CR lose weight which is disproportionately contributed to by white adipose tissue. Generally animals on CR change their activity patterns so that they are more active prior to food delivery each day but total activity may be unchanged or reduced. Considerable debate has occurred over the effects of CR on resting metabolic rate (RMR). Total RMR declines, but as body mass and body composition also change it is unclear whether metabolism at the tissue level also declines, is unchanged or even increases. Body temperature universally decreases. Hunger is increased and does not seem to abate even with very long term restriction. Circulating adipokines are reduced reflecting the reduction in white adipose tissue (WAT) mass under restriction and there is a large reduction in circulating insulin and glucose levels. There are profound tissue level changes in metabolism with a generalized shift from carbohydrate to fat metabolism. Four pathways have been implicated in mediating the CR effect. These are the insulin like growth factor (IGF-1)/insulin signaling pathway, the sirtuin pathway, the adenosine monophosphate (AMP) activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway and the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway. These different pathways may interact and may all play important roles mediating different aspects of the response. Exactly how they generate the health benefits remains open for debate, however CR results in reduced oxidative stress and enhanced autophagy, both of which could be essential components of the beneficial effects. Most data about the effects of CR in mammals comes from work on rodents. There is limited work on non-human primates that shows promising effects and one randomized controlled trial in humans where physiological markers of the CR response are consistent with the responses in mice and rats. There are also populations of humans voluntarily restricting themselves. Humans on long term restriction report similar negative side effects to those observed in animals - perpetual hunger, reduced body temperature leading to a feeling of being cold, and diminished libido. Considerable effort has been directed in recent years to find drugs that mimic the CR response. Promising candidates are those that intersect with the critical signaling pathways identified above and include biguanides such as metformin that target the insulin signaling pathway, stilbenes (e.g. resveratrol) that affect sirtuin activity and drugs such as rapamycin that interact with mTOR signaling. Whether it will ever be possible to find drugs that capture the health benefits of CR without the negative side-effects remains unclear. Moreover, even if such drugs are developed how the current licensing system for drug use in western societies would cope with them may be a further obstacle to their use.",

We employed six groups including non-pregnant, HFD-fed or control diet-fed pregnant mice with or without TCPOBOP treatment (n=6). In HFD pregnant mice, insulin resistance increased with increasing expression of gluconeogenic and lipogenic genes and abnormal adipocytokine levels. TCPOBOP treatment, which was once-weekly intraperitoneal injections (0.5 mg/kg) and started at day 0.5 of pregnancy, improved glucose tolerance with significant changes of gluconeogenic, lipogenic and adipocytokine genes. HFD pregnant mice had hypertension and proteinuria, while TCPOBOP treatment ameliorated these signs. Our data suggested CAR might be a potential therapeutic target for obese preeclampsia patients with insulin resistance.",

    "title": "Cytokines regulate neuronal gene expression: differential effects of Th1, Th2 and monocyte/macrophage cytokines.",
    "abstract": "Inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, contribute to neuronal and axonal dysfunction and cell death. To examine the roles of cytokines in pathogenesis and regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS), we analyzed effects of cytokines on early gene regulation (6h) in neuronal cultures, employing gene arrays. Our hypothesis is that neuronal gene expression is differentially regulated in vitro by cytokine mixtures typical of Th1 and Th2 T cells and monocytes/macrophages (M/M). Th1 and M/M cytokines showed similar patterns for regulation of numerous pathways including cytokine-receptor interactions, MAP kinase, toll like receptors, apoptosis, PPAR signaling, cell adhesion molecules (CAMS), antigen processing, adipocytokine, and JAK-STAT signaling. M/M cytokines uniquely regulated genes in T cell, B cell and ECM receptor signaling pathways. Th2 cytokines had few effects on pathways regulated by Th1 and MM cytokines, but uniquely regulated genes related to neuroactive ligand-receptors and calcium. Th1 and MM cytokines markedly upregulated a wide array of cytokine-related genes. Notably, M/M cytokines uniquely upregulated G-CSF, GM-CSF, CXCL5 and lymphotactin (Xcl1). Th2 cytokines did not upregulate cytokine-related genes, with the exception of CCL11 and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 1, a VEGF receptor. In neuroactive ligand-receptor pathways, Th1 and M/M cytokines upregulated gene expression for tryptophan hydroxylase. Th1 cytokines upregulated gene expression for GABA A receptor, delta, while Th2 cytokines downregulated GABA A receptor, gamma 3. Significant changes occurred in several genes in the wnt and Notch signaling pathways, which are highly conserved and play critical roles in neuronal and glial differentiation. In the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, proinflammatory cytokine mixtures induced upregulation of several genes, notably ubiquitin D (Ubd/FAT10), ubiquitin ligase and several proteasomal proteins. In agreement with microarray results, QRT-PCR showed marked upregulation of gene expression for Ubd with Th1 and M/M, for transglutaminase 2 with M/M, and for arginase 1 with Th2 cytokines. Expression of Ubd in the nervous system has not been previously reported. Both message and protein for Ubd are expressed in neurons, and upregulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines. Transglutaminase 2 has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, and proposed as a therapeutic target. Upregulation of arginase by Th2 cytokines could be potentially neuroprotective by decreasing NO generation and enhancing neurite outgrowth. Our analysis of changes in neuronal gene expression at the time of initial exposure to an abnormal cytokine milieu provides the opportunity to identify early changes that could be reversed to prevent later irreversible neuronal damage and death in multiple sclerosis and other CNS diseases.",

    "abstract": "The use of higher erythropoietin (EPO) doses is associated with an increased risk of an adverse outcome and increased mortality in patients with renal failure. Resistin is related to heart disease, and may contribute to an increased atherosclerotic risk. We hypothesized that a link between resistin and EPO responsiveness may exist. We therefore investigated the relationship between resistin and the EPO resistance index (ERI) in nondiabetic hemodialysis (HD) patients. Fifty-seven patients enrolled in the study underwent HD for &#x2265; 3 months and intravenous EPO therapy to maintain a target hemoglobin (Hb) level of 11.0 g/dl. The ERI was defined as the weekly EPO dose per unit Hb per body weight. The mean patient age was 52.6 &#xb1; 11.9 years and the mean time on dialysis was 4.9 &#xb1; 4.4 years. Serum Hb and ERI were 10.4 &#xb1; 0.7 g/dl, and 13.3 &#xb1; 7.0 (IU/kg/week/g/dl), respectively. Serum resistin levels were 23.6 &#xb1; 9.3 &#xb5;g/L. EPO resistance is associated with low body mass index (BMI) (coefficient &#x3b2; =-0.393, p = 0.002) and with high serum resistin levels (coefficient &#x3b2; = 0.332, p = 0.018). According to a multiple regression analysis, the serum resistin level was a significant independent factor related to EPO resistance (p = 0.017). The results suggest that serum resistin levels reflect EPO responsiveness in nondiabetic HD patients. Resistin may therefore be considered as a new marker of EPO responsiveness in HD patients.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is a leading cause of mortality in the Western world, and plaque diagnosis is still a challenge in cardiovascular medicine. The main focus of this study was to make atherosclerotic plaques visible using targeted nanoparticles for improved imaging. Today various biomarkers are known to be involved in the pathophysiologic scenario of atherosclerotic plaques. One promising new candidate is the globular domain of the adipocytokine adiponectin (gAd), which was used as a targeting sequence in this study. gAd was coupled to two different types of nanoparticles, namely protamine-oligonucleotide nanoparticles, known as proticles, and sterically stabilized liposomes. Both gAd-targeted nanoparticles were investigated for their potency to characterize critical scenarios within early and advanced atherosclerotic plaque lesions using an atherosclerotic mouse model. Aortic tissue from wild type and apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, both fed a high-fat diet, were stained with either fluorescent-labeled gAd or gAd-coupled nanoparticles. Ex vivo imaging was performed using confocal laser scanning microscopy. gAd-targeted sterically stabilized liposomes generated a strong signal by accumulating at the surface of atherosclerotic plaques, while gAd-targeted proticles became internalized and showed more spotted plaque staining. Our results offer a promising perspective for enhanced in vivo imaging using gAd-targeted nanoparticles. By means of nanoparticles, a higher payload of signal emitting molecules could be transported to atherosclerotic plaques. Additionally, the opportunity is opened up to visualize different regions in the plaque scenario, depending on the nature of the nanoparticle used.",

    "title": "Notch, IL-1 and leptin crosstalk outcome (NILCO) is critical for leptin-induced proliferation, migration and VEGF/VEGFR-2 expression in breast cancer.",
    "abstract": "High levels of pro-angiogenic factors, leptin, IL-1, Notch and VEGF (ligands and receptors), are found in breast cancer, which is commonly correlated with metastasis and lower survival of patients. We have previously reported that leptin induces the growth of breast cancer and the expression of VEGF/VEGFR-2 and IL-1 system. We hypothesized that Notch, IL-1 and leptin crosstalk outcome (NILCO) plays an essential role in the regulation of leptin-mediated induction of proliferation/migration and expression of pro-angiogenic molecules in breast cancer. To test this hypothesis, leptin's effects on the expression and activation of Notch signaling pathway and VEGF/VEGFR-2/IL-1 were determined in mouse (4T1, EMT6 and MMT) breast cancer cells. Remarkably, leptin up-regulated Notch1-4/JAG1/Dll-4, Notch target genes: Hey2 and survivin, together with IL-1 and VEGF/VEGFR-2. RNA knockdown and pharmacological inhibitors of leptin signaling significantly abrogated activity of reporter gene-luciferase CSL (RBP-Jk) promoter, showing that it was linked to leptin-activated JAK2/STAT3, MAPK, PI-3K/mTOR, p38 and JNK signaling pathways. Interestingly, leptin upregulatory effects on cell proliferation/migration and pro-angiogenic factors Notch, IL-1 and VEGF/VEGFR-2 were abrogated by a &#x3b3;-secretase inhibitor, DAPT, as well as siRNA against CSL. In addition, blockade of IL-1R tI inhibited leptin-induced Notch, Hey2 and survivin as well as VEGF/VEGFR-2 expression. These data suggest leptin is an inducer of Notch (expression/activation) and IL-1 signaling modulates leptin effects on Notch and VEGF/VEGFR-2. We show for the first time that a novel unveiled crosstalk between Notch, IL-1 and leptin (NILCO) occurs in breast cancer. Leptin induction of proliferation/migration and upregulation of VEGF/VEGFR-2 in breast cancer cells were related to an intact Notch signaling axis. NILCO could represent the integration of developmental, pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic signals critical for leptin-induced cell proliferation/migration and regulation of VEGF/VEGFR-2 in breast cancer. Targeting NILCO might help to design new pharmacological strategies aimed at controlling breast cancer growth and angiogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Rosiglitazone is a PPAR&#x3b3; agonist commonly used to treat diabetes. In addition to improving insulin sensitivity, rosiglitazone restores normal vascular function by a mechanism that remains poorly understood. Here we show that adiponectin is required to mediate the PPAR&#x3b3; effect on vascular endothelium of diabetic mice. In db/db and diet-induced obese mice, PPAR&#x3b3; activation by rosiglitazone restores endothelium-dependent relaxation of aortae, whereas diabetic mice lacking adiponectin or treated with an anti-adiponectin antibody do not respond. Rosiglitazone stimulates adiponectin release from fat explants, and subcutaneous fat transplantation from rosiglitazone-treated mice recapitulates vasodilatation in untreated db/db recipients. Mechanistically, adiponectin activates AMPK/eNOS and cAMP/PKA signaling pathways in aortae, which increase NO bioavailability and reduce oxidative stress. Taken together, these results demonstrate that adipocyte-derived adiponectin is required for PPAR&#x3b3;-mediated improvement of endothelial function in diabetes. Thus, the adipose tissue represents a promising target for treating diabetic vasculopathy.",

Tight glycemic and blood pressure control can dramatically slow, but not stop, the progression of the disease, and a large number of patients progress toward end-stage renal disease despite currently available interventions. An early and key event in the development of DN is loss of podocyte function (or glomerular visceral epithelial cells) from the kidney glomerulus, where they contribute to the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier. Recent evidence suggests that podocytes can be the direct target of circulating hormones, lipids, and adipokines that are affected in diabetes.

    "title": "[Diabetes and cancer risk: oncologic considerations].",
    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus and malignant tumors are frequent diseases worldwide. The incidence of these two diseases is growing continuously and causes serious health care problem. Population based epidemiologic studies show that the coexistence of type 2 diabetes and malignant tumors is more frequent than expected by the age-corrected incidence and prevalence of each disease. Epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses show that type 2 diabetes increases the risk and tumor specific mortality of certain cancers. The overlapping risk factors of the diseases suggest a relationship between type 2 diabetes and malignant tumors, with a significant role of obesity as a major risk factor. In the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes there are several biological processes, which may explain the higher cancer risk in type 2 diabetes. In vitro experiments, and in vivo animal studies show that the mitotic effect of hyperinsulinemia plays an important role in the relationship of cancer and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Recent studies show that the different treatment modalities, antidiabetic drugs and their combinations used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes can modify cancer risk. The majority of the data show that metformin therapy decreases, while insulin secretagog drugs slightly increase the risk of certain types of cancers in type 2 diabetes. Metformin can decrease cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in certain cancer cell lines. Endogenous and exogenous (therapy induced) hyperinsulinemia may be mitogenic and may increase the risk of cancer in type 2 diabetes. Human studies showed that the analogue insulin glargin increases the risk of certain cancers. As a result of conceptual weaknesses in study design, data collection, and statistical methods the results of these studies are questionable. According to present knowledge, obtaining and maintaining optimal metabolic target values with the appropriate choice of treatment modality is the aim of treatment in type 2 diabetes. Presently, study results showing elevated mitogenic potential with some antidiabetic treatment modalities are not taken into account, when considering the choice of antidiabetic treatment in type 2 diabetic patients. In the care of patients with increased cancer risk, oncologic considerations should be taken into account. Well designed, prospective, clinical studies would be necessary to demonstrate the possible correlation between treatment modalities of type 2 diabetes and change of cancer risk in type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

In this study, rainbow trout was exposed to low (0.5 and 5.0nM) concentrations of medetomidine for up to 54 days. Recently we have reported on effects on paleness and melanophore aggregation of medetomidine in these fish. Here, specific growth rates were investigated together with a broad set of physiological parameters including plasma levels of growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and leptin, glucose and haemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Ht), condition factor, liver and heart somatic indexes (LSI, HSI). Hepatic enzyme activities of CYP1A (EROD activity), glutathione S-transferases (GST) and glutathione reductase (GR) were also measured. Additionally, hepatic mRNA expression was analysed through microarray and quantitative PCR in fish sampled after 31 days of exposure. Medetomidine at both concentrations significantly lowered blood glucose levels and the higher concentration significantly reduced the LSI. The mRNA expression analysis revealed few differentially expressed genes in the liver and the false discovery rate was high. Taken together, the results suggest that medetomidine at investigated concentrations could interfere with carbohydrate metabolism of exposed fish but without any clear consequences for growth.",

Leptin is known as an important regulator of mesenchymal differentiation. The objective of this study was to elucidate the role of leptin on proliferation and differentiation of dental MSCs. Enhancement of cemento/odontoblastic differentiation of dental stem cells by leptin was confirmed by alizarin red S staining and alkaline phosphatase activity staining. In contrast, leptin reduced adipogenesis in both dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) and periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) confirmed by oil red O staining and RT-PCR. The expression of adipogenic markers, lipoprotein lipase and proliferator-activated receptor &#x3b3;2 (PPAR&#x3b3;2), were suppressed in PDLSCs incubated on media supplemented with leptin for 2 weeks. Leptin had a relatively stronger osteogenesis promoting effect and adipogenesis suppressing effect in PDLSCs than in DPSCs. Collectively, leptin had a relatively stronger promoting effect on cemento/odontoblastic differentiation and a suppressing effect on adipogenesis in PDLSCs than in DPSCs. This study has provided evidence that leptin acts as an important modulator of dental MSCs differentiation.",

Eleven patients with GHD [four women/seven men, 58 years (29-69 years)] without GH therapy were included in the study. Eight patients were treated with LB03002 for 12 months and three patients received placebo for 6 months followed by LB03002 for 6 months. A 3-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed at study entry and at study end. Additionally, IGF-I, cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, leptin, ghrelin, HbA1c and C-peptide were measured. Body composition was evaluated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and waist/hip ratio (WHR) and waist/height (WHtR) ratio were measured by tape and scale.

    "abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) presents a tremendous challenge for the delivery of drugs to the central nervous system (CNS). This includes drugs that target brain receptors for the treatment of obesity and anorexia. Strategic drug delivery to brain (SDDB) is an approach that considers in depth the relations among the BBB, the candidate therapeutic, the CNS target, and the disease state to be treated. Here, we illustrate principles of SDDB with two different approaches to developing drugs based on leptin. In normal body weight humans and in non-obese rodents, leptin is readily transported across the BBB and into the CNS where it inhibits feeding and enhances thermogenesis. However, in obesity, the transport of leptin across the BBB is impaired, resulting in a resistance to leptin. As a result, it is difficult to treat obesity with leptin or its analogs that depend on the leptin transporter for access to the CNS. To treat obesity, we developed a leptin agonist modified by the addition of pluronic block copolymers (P85-leptin). P85-leptin retains biological activity and is capable of crossing the BBB by a mechanism that is not dependent on the leptin transporter. As such, P85-leptin is able to cross the BBB of obese mice at a rate similar to that of native leptin in lean mice. To treat anorexia, we developed a leptin antagonist modified by pegylation (PEG-MLA) that acts primarily by blocking the BBB transporter for endogenous, circulating leptin. This prevents blood-borne, endogenous leptin from entering the CNS, essentially mimicking the leptin resistance seen in obesity, and resulting in a significant increase in adiposity. These examples illustrate two strategies in which an understanding of the interactions among the BBB, CNS targets, and candidate therapeutics under physiologic and diseased conditions can be used to develop drugs effective for the treatment of brain disease.",

    "title": "Fetal hypothalamic neuroprogenitor cell culture: preferential differentiation paths induced by leptin and insulin.",
    "abstract": "In response to temporally orchestrated growth factor stimulation, developing neural stem/progenitor cells undergo extensive self-renewal and then generate neurons and astrocytes. Fetal neonatal leptin and insulin deficiency results in reduced hypothalamic axonal pathways regulating appetite, which may predispose to offspring hyperphagia and obesity. Neural development of the arcuate nucleus, a key target of adiposity signals, leptin and insulin, is immature at birth. Hence, to explore proximate effects of leptin/insulin on hypothalamic development, we determined trophic and differentiation effects on neural stem/progenitor cells using a model of fetal hypothalamic neurospheres (NS). NS cultures were produced from embryonic d 20 fetal rats and passage 1 and passage 2 cells examined for proliferation and differentiation into neurons (neuronal nuclei, class III&#x3b2;-tubulin, and doublecortin) and astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein). Leptin-induced NS proliferation was significantly greater than that induced by insulin, although both effects were blocked by Notch, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, or signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 inhibition. Leptin preferentially induced neuronal, whereas insulin promoted astrocyte differentiation. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibition suppressed both leptin and insulin-mediated differentiation, whereas signal transducer and activator of transcription inhibition only affected leptin-mediated responses. These findings demonstrate preferential and disparate differentiation paths induced by leptin and insulin. Altered fetal exposure to leptin or insulin, resulting from fetal growth restriction, macrosomia, or maternal diabetes, may potentially have marked effects on fetal brain development.",

    "title": "Development of calorie restriction mimetics as therapeutics for obesity, diabetes, inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases.",
    "abstract": "Calorie restriction (CR) is the most robust intervention that decreases morbidity and mortality, and thereby increases the lifespan of many organisms. Although the signaling pathways involved in the beneficial effects of CR are not yet fully understood. Several candidate pathways and key molecules have been identified. The effects of CR are highly conserved from lower organisms such as yeast to higher mammals such as rodents and monkeys. Recent studies have also demonstrated beneficial effects of CR in humans, although we need much longer studies to evaluate whether CR also increases the lifespan of humans. In reality, it is difficult for us to conduct CR interventions in humans because the subjects must be kept in a state of hunger and the duration of this state needed to achieve a clinically meaningful effect is still unknown. Thus, research in this field is focusing on the development of molecules that mimic the beneficial effects of CR without reducing food intake. Some of these candidate molecules include plant-derived functional chemicals (phyto-chemicals), synthetic small molecules, and endocrine molecules such as adipokines. Several studies have already shown that this research field may yield novel drugs for the treatment of age-related diseases such as diabetes. In this article, we describe the target pathways, candidate molecules, and strategies to develop CR mimetics.",

    "abstract": "The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) nevirapine and efavirenz are drugs of choice for initial antiretroviral treatment for HIV-1 infection. Although NNRTIs have not traditionally been associated with the appearance of adipose alterations, recent data suggest that efavirenz may contribute to adipose tissue alterations in antiretroviral-treated patients, consistent with its ability to impair differentiation of adipocytes in cell cultures. No such effects have been reported for nevirapine, the other most commonly used NNRTI. In this study, we determined the effects of nevirapine on differentiation, gene expression and release of regulatory proteins (adipokines and cytokines) in differentiating human adipocytes, and compared them with those of efavirenz. Efavirenz caused a dose-dependent repression of adipocyte differentiation that was associated with down-regulation of the master adipogenesis regulator genes SREBP-1, PPAR&#x3b3; and C/EBP&#x3b1;, and their target genes encoding lipoprotein lipase, leptin and adiponectin, which are key proteins in adipocyte function. In contrast, nevirapine does not affect adipogenesis and causes a modest but significant coordinate increase in the expression of SREBP-1, PPAR&#x3b3; and C/EBP&#x3b1; and their target genes only at a concentration of 20 &#x3bc;M. Whereas efavirenz caused a significant increase in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-8, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), nevirapine either had no effect on these factors or decreased their release (IL-6 and HGF). Nevirapine significantly increased adiponectin release, whereas efavirenz strongly repressed it. Moreover, nevirapine inhibited preadipocyte endogenous reverse transcriptase activity, whereas efavirenz did not alter it. It is concluded that, in contrast with the profound anti-adipogenic and pro-inflammatory response elicited by efavirenz, nevirapine does not impair adipogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin is an adipokine first described just over a decade ago. Produced almost exclusively by adipocytes, adiponectin circulates in high concentrations in human plasma. Research into this hormone has revealed it to have insulin-sensitizing, anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective roles. This review discusses the history, biology and physiological role of adiponectin and explores its role in disease, with specific focus on adiponectin in inflammation and sepsis. It appears that an inverse relationship exists between adiponectin and inflammatory cytokines. Low levels of adiponectin have been found in critically ill patients, although data are limited in human subjects at this stage. The role of adiponectin in systemic inflammation and critical illness is not well defined. Early data suggest that plasma levels of adiponectin are decreased in critical illness. Whether this is a result of the disease process itself or whether patients with lower levels of this hormone are more susceptible to developing a critical illness is not known. This observation of lower adiponectin levels then raises the possibility of therapeutic options to increase circulating adiponectin levels. The various options for modulation of serum adiponectin (recombinant adiponectin, thiazolidinediones) are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin, an adipose-derived protein, shows insulin-sensitizing, anti-diabetic and anti-atherogenic activities, which implies that the protein represents a potential target to improve lifestyle-related diseases like type 2 diabetes. Based on our hypothesis that agents that cause adipocyte differentiation could also act as adiponectin secretion enhancers, we screened butanol extracts of 96 fungus culture extracts for their differentiation-inducing activity in ST-13 preadipocytes. We found that the butanol extract of a fungus P16 culture extract possessed such an activity, and isolated norlichexanthone as an active compound through activity-guided fractionation. Oil red O staining showed that norlichexanthone induced adipogenesis in ST-13 cells. Its differentiation-inducing activity was supported by the observation that norlichexanthone dose-dependently increased the mRNA expression of fatty acid-binding protein and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor &#x3b3; (PPAR&#x3b3;), markers of adipocyte differentiation. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the compound enhanced the secretion of adiponectin protein in a dose-dependent manner. An increase in mRNA expression of adiponectin was also observed in the norlichexanthone-treated ST-13 cells. Actinomycin D treatment blocked the enhancement of adiponectin mRNA expression by norlichexanthone, suggesting that it is the result of increased transcription. A luciferase reporter assay indicated that norlichexanthone was unlikely to be an agonist of PPAR&#x3b3;, implying that its action of mechanism might differ from those of thiazolidinediones which upregulate adiponectin expression via activation of PPAR&#x3b3;. These findings suggest the possibility that norlichexanthone has the potential to treat and/or prevent lifestyle-related diseases, including metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases.",

    "title": "Insulin but not leptin protects olfactory mucosa from apoptosis.",
    "abstract": "The mammalian olfactory mucosa (OM) is continually renewed throughout life. Owing to their position in the nasal cavity, OM cells are exposed to multiple insults, including high levels of odourants that can induce their death. OM regeneration is therefore essential to maintain olfactory function, and requires the tight control of both cell death and proliferation. Apoptosis has been implicated in OM cell death. Olfaction is one of the senses involved in food intake and depends on individual nutritional status. We have previously reported the influence of hormones related to nutritional status on odour perception and have shown that the OM is a target of insulin and leptin, two hormones known for their anti-apoptotic properties. In the present study, we investigated the potential anti-apoptotic effect of these metabolic hormones on OM cells. Both Odora cells (an olfactive cell line) and OM cells treated with etoposide, a p53 activity inducer, exhibited mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis that was inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk. Insulin, but not leptin, impaired this apoptotic effect. Insulin addition to the culture medium reduced p53 phosphorylation, caspase-3 and caspase-9 cleavage, and caspase-3 enzymatic activity induced by etoposide. The apoptotic wave observed in the OM after interruption of the neuronal connections between the OM and the olfactory bulb by bulbectomy was impaired by intranasal insulin treatment. These findings suggest that insulin may be involved in OM cellular dynamics, through endocrine and/or paracrine-autocrine effects of circulating or local insulin, respectively.",

    "title": "Resistin: functional roles and therapeutic considerations for cardiovascular disease.",
    "abstract": "Resistin, originally described as an adipocyte-specific hormone, has been suggested to be an important link between obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes. Although its expression was initially defined in adipocytes, significant levels of resistin expression in humans are mainly found in mononuclear leukocytes, macrophages, spleen and bone marrow cells. Increasing evidence indicates that resistin plays important regulatory roles apart from its role in insulin resistance and diabetes in a variety of biological processes: atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, autoimmune disease, malignancy, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease and chronic kidney disease. As CVD accounts for a significant amount of morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes and without diabetes, it is important to understand the role that adipokines such as resistin play in the cardiovascular system. Evidence suggests that resistin is involved in pathological processes leading to CVD including inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, thrombosis, angiogenesis and smooth muscle cell dysfunction. The modes of action and signalling pathways whereby resistin interacts with its target cells are beginning to be understood. In this review, the current knowledge about the functions and pathophysiological implications of resistin in CVD development is summarized; clinical translations, therapeutic considerations and future directions in the field of resistin research are discussed.

    "abstract": "The increase in obesity prevalence highlights the need for a more comprehensive understanding of the neural systems controlling food intake; one that extends beyond food intake driven by metabolic need and considers that driven by higher-order cognitive factors. The hippocampus, a brain structure involved in learning and memory function, has recently been linked with food intake control. Here we examine whether administration of the adiposity hormone leptin to the dorsal and ventral sub-regions of the hippocampus influences food intake and memory for food. Leptin (0.1&#x2009;&#x3bc;g) delivered bilaterally to the ventral hippocampus suppressed food intake and body weight measured 24&#x2009;h after administration; a higher dose (0.4&#x2009;&#x3bc;g) was needed to suppress intake following dorsal hippocampal delivery. Leptin administration to the ventral but not dorsal hippocampus blocked the expression of a conditioned place preference for food and increased the latency to run for food in an operant runway paradigm. Additionally, ventral but not dorsal hippocampal leptin delivery suppressed memory consolidation for the spatial location of food, whereas hippocampal leptin delivery had no effect on memory consolidation in a non-spatial appetitive response paradigm. Collectively these findings indicate that ventral hippocampal leptin signaling contributes to the inhibition of food-related memories elicited by contextual stimuli. To conclude, the results support a role for hippocampal leptin signaling in the control of food intake and food-related memory processing.",

    "title": "Resistin promotes cardiac hypertrophy via the AMP-activated protein kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin (AMPK/mTOR) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase/insulin receptor substrate 1 (JNK/IRS1) pathways.",
    "abstract": "Resistin has been suggested to be involved in the development of diabetes and insulin resistance. We recently reported that resistin is expressed in diabetic hearts and promotes cardiac hypertrophy; however, the mechanisms underlying this process are currently unknown. Therefore, we wanted to elucidate the mechanisms associated with resistin-induced cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial insulin resistance. Overexpression of resistin using adenoviral vector in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes was associated with inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity, activation of tuberous sclerosis complex 2/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, and increased cell size, [(3)H]leucine incorporation (i.e. protein synthesis) and mRNA expression of the hypertrophic marker genes, atrial natriuretic factor, brain natriuretic peptide, and &#x3b2;-myosin heavy chain. Activation of AMPK with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carbozamide-1-&#x3b2;-D-ribifuranoside or inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin or mTOR siRNA attenuated these resistin-induced changes. Furthermore, resistin increased serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS1) through the activation of the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1/c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) pathway, a module known to stimulate insulin resistance. Inhibition of JNK (with JNK inhibitor SP600125 or using dominant-negative JNK) reduced serine 307 phosphorylation of IRS1. Resistin also stimulated the activation of p70(S6K), a downstream kinase target of mTOR, and increased phosphorylation of the IRS1 serine 636/639 residues, whereas treatment with rapamycin reduced the phosphorylation of these residues. Interestingly, these in vitro signaling pathways were also operative in vivo in ventricular tissues from adult rat hearts overexpressing resistin. These data demonstrate that resistin induces cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial insulin resistance, possibly via the AMPK/mTOR/p70(S6K) and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1/JNK/IRS1 pathways.",

    "title": "Leptin therapy reverses hyperglycemia in mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes, independent of hepatic leptin signaling.",
    "abstract": "Leptin therapy has been found to reverse hyperglycemia and prevent mortality in several rodent models of type 1 diabetes. Yet the mechanism of leptin-mediated reversal of hyperglycemia has not been fully defined. The liver is a key organ regulating glucose metabolism and is also a target of leptin action. Thus we hypothesized that exogenous leptin administered to mice with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes reverses hyperglycemia through direct action on hepatocytes. After the induction of diabetes in mice with a high dose of STZ, recombinant mouse leptin was delivered at a supraphysiological dose for 14 days by an osmotic pump implant. We characterized the effect of leptin administration in C57Bl/6J mice with STZ-induced diabetes and then examined whether leptin therapy could reverse STZ-induced hyperglycemia in mice in which hepatic leptin signaling was specifically disrupted. Hyperleptinemia reversed hyperglycemia and hyperketonemia in diabetic C57Bl/6J mice and dramatically improved glucose tolerance. These effects were associated with reduced plasma glucagon and growth hormone levels and dramatically enhanced insulin sensitivity, without changes in glucose uptake by skeletal muscle. Leptin therapy also ameliorated STZ-induced hyperglycemia and hyperketonemia in mice with disrupted hepatic leptin signaling to a similar extent as observed in wild-type littermates with STZ-induced diabetes. These observations reveal that hyperleptinemia reverses the symptoms of STZ-induced diabetes in mice and that this action does not require direct leptin signaling in the liver.",

Using human coronary artery VSMC, we found that recombinant adiponectin in the high-molecular-weight or trimeric forms but not the globular form induced VSMC differentiation through a mechanism similar to the classic feedback signaling used by rapamycin, a drug known to effectively inhibit restenosis on drug-eluting stents. Using a combination of pharmacological agents, small interfering RNA, and overexpression approaches, we demonstrated that adiponectin activated 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase &#x3b1;2 isoform, leading to inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 and S6K1. This in turn stabilized insulin receptor substrate-1, driving Akt2-mediated inhibition of FoxO4 and subsequent contractile protein induction. Although adiponectin and rapamycin have similarly beneficial effects on VSMC phenotype in both cell and organ culture, a direct comparison of the effects of rapamycin versus adiponectin on endothelial cells revealed distinct differences: rapamycin inhibited Akt phosphorylation, whereas adiponectin maintained it. Importantly, Akt activity preserves endothelial function. Adiponectin promotes VSMC differentiation and preserves endothelial cell Akt signaling, suggesting that targeting the adiponectin pathway may have advantages over rapamycin in developing new drug-eluting stent therapeutics.",

    "title": "Adiponectin as a regulator of vascular redox state: therapeutic implications.",
    "abstract": "Recently, adipose tissue has been implicated in the regulation of vascular function in humans. This regulatory function is mediated via the release of vasoactive cytokines called adipokines. Adiponectin is an adipokine with powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties being dysregulated in obesity and in insulin resistance states. In both in vitro and in vivo models adiponectin has been shown to increase nitric oxide bioavailability, improve endothelial function, and exert beneficial effects on vascular smooth muscle cell function. Strategies to upregulate adiponectin expression or to potentiate adiponectin signalling may favourably modulate vascular redox state and therefore reduce cardiovascular risk. Various drug classes such as glitazones, newer sulfonylureas, angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors and nicotinic acid exert beneficial effects on insulin resistance partly by increasing plasma adiponectin levels. Others such as tetrahydrobiopterin or certain antioxidants are also promising in normalizing plasma adiponectin levels. Given the central role of adiponectin in vascular disease states and obesity-related metabolic disorders, improving adiponectin vascular or systemic bioavailability via existing drugs or novel therapeutic strategies may be valuable in the prevention of cardiovascular disease in humans. The discussion of recent patents for the adiponectin as a regulator of vascular redox state also included in this review article.",

    "abstract": "Resistin is a cytokine which plays an important role in cardiovascular disease by influencing systemic inflammation and endothelial activation. In human endothelial cells (HEC) it increases the expression of P-selectin and fractalkine, and enhances monocyte adhesion by antioxidant mechanisms. This study investigated whether the natural antioxidants curcumin (CC) and an extract of Morus alba leaves (MA) have protective effects in resistin-activated HEC. HEC were exposed to 100&#x2009;ng/mL resistin for 6 and 18&#x2009;h in the absence or presence of MA or CC and the expression of fractalkine and P-selectin was determined by RT-PCR and western blot. Intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was monitored by fluorimetry and NADPH oxidase activity by a lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence assay. In addition, adhesion assays using the monocytic U937 cells were performed. The results showed that treatment of HEC exposed to resistin with MA and CC: (1) inhibited significantly P-selectin and fractalkine expression, (2) inhibited the increase in the intracellular ROS level, (3) reduced NADPH activation and (4) reduced monocytes adhesion to HEC. The results indicate that MA and curcumin target resistin-induced human endothelial activation partly via antioxidant mechanisms and suggest that they may represent therapeutic agents in vascular disease mediated by resistin.",

    "title": "Microvesicles released from rat adipocytes and harboring glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins transfer RNA stimulating lipid synthesis.",
    "abstract": "Small microvesicles, such as microparticles and exosomes, have been demonstrated to transfer proteins and nucleic acids from a variety of donor to acceptor cells with corresponding (patho)physiological consequences. Recently the in vitro transfer of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins from microvesicles released from large rat adipocytes to intracellular lipid droplets (LDs) of small adipocytes has been shown to be upregulated by physiological (palmitate, H(2)O(2)) and pharmacological (anti-diabetic sulfonylurea drug glimepiride) stimuli and to increase the esterification into as well as to reduce the release of fatty acids from triacylglycerol. Here microvesicles derived from (preferentially large) rat adipocytes or plasma and harboring the GPI-anchored proteins, Gce1 and CD73, were demonstrated to contain specific transcripts and microRNAs that are both transferred into and expressed in acceptor adipocytes and are involved in the upregulation of lipogenesis and cell size. The transferred transcripts were specific for fatty acid esterification (glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase-3, diacylglycerol acyltransferase-2), lipid droplet biogenesis (FSP27, caveolin-1) and adipokines (leptin, adiponectin). The transfer and lipogenic activity were more efficient for small rather than large acceptor adipocytes and significantly upregulated by palmitate, glimepiride and H(2)O(2). Together the data suggest that microvesicles released from large adipocytes stimulate lipid storage in small adipocytes by mediating horizontal transfer of lipogenic information which is encoded by relevant (micro)RNA and GPI-anchored protein species. Paracrine and endocrine regulation of lipid storage and, in parallel, cell size of white adipocytes by specific (micro)RNAs in GPI-anchored protein-harboring microvesicles may represent a novel target for interference with metabolic diseases, such as obesity and metabolic syndrome.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing body of evidence that blood pressure (BP) level is one of the major determinants of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in individuals, including elderly people. However, to achieve a target BP level in the elderly is more difficult compared with patients aged &lt;65 years. Current guidelines recommend combination drug therapy with different modes of action for the treatment of elderly patients with moderate hypertension (HT). However, the optimal combination regimen is not well established in elderly HT. We hypothesized that combination therapy of telmisartan plus amlodipine would exert favorable cardiometabolic actions in elderly HT. Seventeen elderly patients with essential HT who failed to achieve a target home BP level with treatment of 5 mg amlodipine plus 80 mg valsartan or 8 mg candesartan for at least 2 months were enrolled. Then the patients were assigned to replace their valsartan or candesartan with 40 mg telmisartan. The subjects were instructed to measure their own BP at home every day during the study periods. Replacement of valsartan or candesartan by telmisartan in amlodipine-treated elderly hypertensive patients showed a significant reduction in morning home systolic BP and evening home systolic and diastolic BP at 12 weeks. Switching to telmisartan significantly increased serum adiponectin level. Our present study suggests that combination therapy with telmisartan plus amlodipine may exert more beneficial cardiometabolic effects in elderly patients with HT compared with valsartan or candesartan plus amlodipine treatment.",

    "title": "Leptin inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma proliferation via p38-MAPK-dependent signalling.",
    "abstract": "Obesity is a significant risk factor for many liver diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Leptin has been identified as a central mediator of factors that regulate energy intake and expenditure, including appetite, metabolism and fat storage. The role of leptin in the initiation, development and progression of HCC remains poorly understood. The aims of this study were to determine the effect(s) of leptin on HCC cell proliferation and to identify potential signalling mechanism(s) by which leptin exerts these effects. Rat H4IIE HCC cells and H4IIE-derived HCC tumours were analysed for leptin receptor (LR) expression. H4IIE cells were treated with leptin (0-100 ng/ml) in the absence or presence of pharmacological inhibitors of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (PD98059), p38-MAPK (SB202190) or Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) (AG490; 10 &#xb5;M) signalling. Cell proliferation was determined and signal pathway activity analysed. Immunohistochemistry identified increased LR expression in HCC in human tissue. Leptin did not significantly affect H4IIE cell numbers in serum-depleted (0.1% [v/v] foetal bovine serum [FBS]) medium. However, leptin significantly inhibited serum-stimulated (1.0% [v/v] FBS) H4IIE proliferation. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that leptin significantly activated p42/p44-MAPK, p38-MAPK and STAT3 signalling in a time-dependent manner. Pretreatment of H4IIE cells with SB202190 abrogated leptin-dependent inhibition of H4IIE proliferation, an effect not observed in cells pretreated with PD98059 or AG490. Leptin inhibits HCC cell growth in vitro via a p38-MAPK-dependent signalling pathway. Identifying similar effects on tumour growth in vivo may provide an attractive therapeutic target for slowing HCC progression.",

WBGE treatment also resulted in significantly higher PPAR&#x3b3; and LPL (lipoprotein lipase) mRNA (P&lt;0.05) in the epididymal adipose tissue. Liver triglyceride and non-esterified fatty acid concentration in WBGE treated mice were significantly lower than those of control mice (P&lt;0.05). Plasma adiponectin level was significantly higher in mice receiving WBGE than in control mice (P&lt;0.05), as the rosiglitazone treated mice.

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma is one of the most fatal cancers, characterized by a strong vascularized phenotype. YKL-40, a secreted glycoprotein, is overexpressed in patients with glioblastomas and has potential as a novel tumor biomarker. The molecular mechanisms of YKL-40 in glioblastoma development, however, are poorly understood. Here, we aimed to elucidate the role YKL-40 plays in the regulation of VEGF expression, tumor angiogenesis, and radioresistance. YKL-40 up-regulated VEGF expression in glioblastoma cell line U87, and both YKL-40 and VEGF synergistically promote endothelial cell angiogenesis. Interestingly, long term inhibition of VEGF up-regulated YKL-40. YKL-40 induced coordination of membrane receptor syndecan-1 and integrin &#x3b1;v&#x3b2;5, and triggered a signaling cascade through FAK(397) to ERK-1 and ERK-2, leading to elevated VEGF and enhanced angiogenesis. In addition, &#x3b3;-irradiation of U87 cells increased YKL-40 expression that protects cell death through AKT activation and also enhances endothelial cell angiogenesis. Blockade of YKL-40 activity or expression decreased tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis in xenografted animals. Immunohistochemical analysis of human glioblastomas revealed a correlation between YKL-40, VEGF, and patient survival. These findings have shed light on the mechanisms by which YKL-40 promotes tumor angiogenesis and malignancy, and thus provide a therapeutic target for tumor treatment.",

    "abstract": "Lipoic acid (LA) is an antioxidant with therapeutic potential on several diseases such as diabetes and obesity. Hyperleptinemia and oxidative stress play a major role in the development of obesity-linked diseases. The aim of this study was to examine in vivo and in vitro the effects of LA on leptin production, as well as to elucidate the mechanisms and signalling pathways involved in LA actions. Dietary supplementation with LA decreased both circulating leptin, and adipose tissue leptin mRNA in rats. Treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with LA caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of leptin secretion and gene expression. Moreover, LA stimulated the anaerobic utilization of glucose to lactate, which negatively correlated with leptin secretion. Furthermore, LA enhanced phosphorylation of Sp1 and inhibited Sp1 transcriptional activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Moreover, LA inhibited Akt phosphorylation, a downstream target of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Treatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 mimicked LA actions, dramatically inhibiting both leptin secretion and gene expression and stimulating Sp1 phosphorylation. All of these data suggest that the phosphorylation of Sp1 and the accompanying reduced DNA-binding activity are likely to be involved in the inhibition of leptin induced by LA, which could be mediated in part by the abrogation of the PI3K/Akt pathway.",

    "abstract": "Rosiglitazone, one of the thiazolidinedione (TZD), is an oral antidiabetic drug that activates a gamma isoform of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR&#x3b3;). To identify target proteins induced by rosiglitazone in adipocytes, we first performed simultaneous in-depth proteomic profiling of cytosolic proteins and secreted proteins (secretome) from 3T3-L1 adipocytes using a label-free quantification method with nano-UPLC MS/MS. In total, we identified 646 proteins from 3T3-L1 adipocytes, of which 172 and 162 proteins were upregulated and downregulated &gt;1.5-fold, respectively, in rosiglitazone-treated cells, as compared to controls. Some differentially expressed proteins in particular, including fatty acid translocase (FAT)/CD36, fatty acid binding protein, lipoprotein lipase, acetyl CoA acyltransferase, carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 2, sterol carrier protein, adiponectin, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase could explain the current action mechanism of TZDs. Furthermore, this study is the first to report on two potential target proteins of rosiglitazone, such as adenomatosis polyposis coli 2 (APC2), and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A-1 (eIF5A) related to apoptosis and cell division. Our data clearly suggest that in-depth proteomic approaches using cytosolic and secreted proteins are important and necessary for identification of drug targets at the protein level.",

    "title": "Visfatin exerts angiogenic effects on human umbilical vein endothelial cells through the mTOR signaling pathway.",
    "abstract": "The biologically active factors known as adipocytokines are secreted primarily by adipose tissues and can act as modulators of angiogenesis. Visfatin, an adipocytokine that has recently been reported to have angiogenic properties, is upregulated in diabetes, cancer, and inflammatory diseases. Because maintenance of an angiogenic balance is critically important in the management of these diseases, understanding the molecular mechanism by which visfatin promotes angiogenesis is very important. In this report, we describe our findings demonstrating that visfatin stimulates the mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which plays important roles in angiogenesis. Visfatin induced the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1&#x3b1; (HIF1&#x3b1;) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in human endothelial cells. Inhibition of the mTOR pathway by rapamycin eliminated the angiogenic and proliferative effects of visfatin. The visfatin-induced increase in VEGF expression was also eliminated by RNA interference-mediated knockdown of the 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K), a downstream target of mTOR. Visfatin inactivated glycogen synthase kinase 3&#x3b2; (GSK3&#x3b2;) by phosphorylating it at Ser-9, leading to the nuclear translocation of &#x3b2;-catenin. Both rapamycin co-treatment and p70S6K knockdown inhibited visfatin-induced GSK3&#x3b2; phosphorylation at Ser-9 and nuclear translocation of &#x3b2;-catenin. Taken together, these results indicate that mTOR signaling is involved in visfatin-induced angiogenesis, and that this signaling leads to visfatin-induced VEGF expression and nuclear translocation of &#x3b2;-catenin.

    "title": "Honokiol enhances adipocyte differentiation by potentiating insulin signaling in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.",
    "abstract": "Adipose tissue plays an essential role in energy homeostasis as a metabolic and endocrine organ. Accordingly, adipocytes are emerging as a major drug target for obesity and obesity-mediated metabolic syndrome. Dysfunction of enlarged adipocytes in obesity is involved in obesity-mediated metabolic syndrome. Adipocytokines, such as adiponectin released from small adipocytes, are able to prevent these disorders. In this study, we found that honokiol, an ingredient of Magnolia officinalis used in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicines, enhanced adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Oil Red O staining showed that treatment with honokiol in the presence of insulin dose-dependently increased lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 preadipoyctes although its activity was weak compared with rosiglitazone. During adipocyte differentiation, the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x3b3;2 (PPAR&#x3b3;2) mRNA and PPAR&#x3b3; target genes such as adipocyte protein 2 (aP2), adiponectin, and GLUT4 was induced by treatment with 10&#xa0;&#x3bc;M honokiol. However, honokiol failed to show direct binding to the PPAR&#x3b3; ligand-binding domain in vitro. In preadipocytes, treatment with honokiol in the presence of insulin increased the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 protein and Akt protein, early insulin signaling pathways related to adipocyte differentiation, compared with insulin-only treatment.

    "title": "Adipose tissue-targeted 11&#x3b2;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 inhibitor protects against diet-induced obesity.",
    "abstract": "Current pharmacological treatments for obesity and metabolic syndrome have various limitations. Recently, adipose tissue 11&#x3b2;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11&#x3b2;-HSD1) has been proposed as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Nevertheless, there is no adipose tissue-targeted 11&#x3b2;-HSD1 inhibitor available now. We sought to develop a new 11&#x3b2;-HSD1 pharmacological inhibitor that homes specifically to the white adipose tissue and aimed to investigate whether adipose tissue-targeted 11&#x3b2;-HSD1 inhibitor might decrease body weight gain and improve glucose tolerance in diet-induced obesity mice. BVT.2733, an 11&#x3b2;-HSD1 selective inhibitor was connected with a peptide CKGGRAKDC that homes to white fat vasculature. CKGGRAKDC-BVT.2733 (T-BVT) or an equimolar mixture of CKGGRAKDC and BVT.2733 (NT-BVT) was given to diet-induced obesity mice for two weeks through subcutaneous injection. T-BVT decreased body weight gain, improved glucose tolerance and decreased adipocyte size compared with vehicle treated mice. In adipose tissue T-BVT administration significantly increased adiponectin, vaspin mRNA levels; In liver T-BVT administration decreased the mRNA level of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), increased the mRNA levels of mitochondrial carnitine palmi-toyltransferase-I (mCPT-I) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor&#x3b1;(PPAR&#x3b1;). No significant differences in adipocyte size and hepatic gene expression were observed after treatment with NT-BVT compared with vehicle treated mice, though NT-BVT also decreased body weight gain, improved glucose tolerance, and increased uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2) mRNA levels in muscle. These results suggest that an adipose tissue-targeted pharmacological inhibitor of 11&#x3b2;-HSD1 may prove to be a new approach for the treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome.",

    "title": "Leptin deficiency and diet-induced obesity reduce hypothalamic kisspeptin expression in mice.",
    "abstract": "The hormone leptin modulates a diverse range of biological functions, including energy homeostasis and reproduction. Leptin promotes GnRH function via an indirect action on forebrain neurons. We tested whether leptin deficiency or leptin resistance due to a high-fat diet (HFD) can regulate the potent reproductive neuropeptide kisspeptin. In mice with normalized levels of estradiol, leptin deficiency markedly reduced kisspeptin gene expression, particularly in the arcuate nucleus (ARC), and kisspeptin immunoreactive cell numbers in the rostral periventricular region of the third ventricle (RP3V). The HFD model was used to determine the effects of diet-induced obesity and central leptin resistance on kisspeptin cell number and gene expression. DBA/2J mice, which are prone to HFD-induced infertility, showed a marked decrease in kisspeptin expression in both the RP3V and ARC and cell numbers in the RP3V after HFD. This is the first evidence that kisspeptin can be regulated by HFD and/or increased body weight. Next we demonstrated that leptin does not signal (via signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 or 5, or mammalian target of rapamycin) directly on kisspeptin-expressing neurons in the RP3V. Lastly, in leptin receptor-deficient mice, neither GnRH nor kisspeptin neurons were activated during a preovulatory-like GnRH/LH surge induction regime, indicating that leptin's actions on GnRH may be upstream of kisspeptin neurons. These data provide evidence that leptin's effects on reproductive function are regulated by kisspeptin neurons in both the ARC and RP3V, although in the latter site the effects are likely to be indirect.",

    "title": "mTOR mediates RhoA-dependent leptin-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.",
    "abstract": "Obesity is associated with increased leptin production which may contribute to cardiac hypertrophy. However, the mechanism of leptin-induced cardiac hypertrophy remains incompletely understood. The Rho family (RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) have recently emerged as important regulators of cell growth. We therefore explored the roles and interrelationships of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), mTOR, and the Rho family in the regulation of actin polymerization and leptin-induced hypertrophy in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. Five minutes treatment with leptin (3.1 nM) resulted in activation of RhoA and Rac1 (by 330 and 160%, respectively, P &lt; 0.05) which was significantly attenuated by AG-490 (50 &#x3bc;M) and LY294002 (10 &#x3bc;M), specific inhibitors of JAK2 and PI3K, respectively. However, Cdc42 activity was unaffected by leptin. The hypertrophic effect of leptin was associated with an increase in phosphorylation of p70(S6K), the major target of mTOR, by 110% (P &lt; 0.05). The specific mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (10 nM) attenuated leptin-induced RhoA and Rac1 activation. Furthermore, the leptin-induced decrease in the G/F-actin ratio, a measure of actin polymerization, was blunted by rapamycin. Leptin produced activation of the transcriptional factor GATA4 which was attenuated by the RhoA inhibitor C3, the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (10 &#x3bc;M) as well as rapamycin. Our results demonstrate a critical role for PI3K/mTOR/p70(S6K) in leptin-induced RhoA activation resulting in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy associated with GATA4 stimulation.",

    "title": "Human resistin stimulates hepatic overproduction of atherogenic ApoB-containing lipoprotein particles by enhancing ApoB stability and impairing intracellular insulin signaling.",
    "abstract": "Obese individuals are at high risk for developing atherosclerosis primarily attributable to elevated plasma concentrations of apolipoprotein (apo)B-containing particles, including very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Plasma levels of the adipose tissue adipokine resistin are increased in human obesity, and resistin expression is positively correlated with coronary atherosclerosis and VLDL levels. We sought to determine for the first time whether resistin directly stimulates human hepatocyte production of apoB-containing particles and to elucidate the mechanisms responsible. Treatment of human hepatocytes with resistin at levels observed in human obesity stimulated apoB secretion up to 10-fold, because of increased microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) activity and decreased expression/phosphorylation of proteins in the insulin signaling pathways (insulin receptor substrate-2, Akt, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase). Resistin also increased hepatocyte lipid content by stimulating de novo lipogenesis via the SREBP1 and SREBP2 pathways. Furthermore, obese serum with elevated resistin levels induced greater hepatocyte stimulation of apoB secretion than lean human serum, an effect that was ameliorated by antibody immunoprecipitation removal of serum resistin. Resistin has a direct deleterious impact on human hepatic lipid and lipoprotein regulation. Resistin greatly increased hepatocyte VLDL apoB and lipid secretion because of MTP activation and induction of hepatocyte insulin resistance. Conversely, antibody removal of serum resistin ameliorated human serum stimulation of apoB secretion. Increased hepatic cellular lipids mediated by resistin reflects the fatty liver/steatosis observed with elevated resistin in humans. Thus, human resistin is a novel therapeutic target for mitigating common hepatic pathophysiological processes associated with human obesity, dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis.",

    "abstract": "Glycerol constitutes an important metabolite for the control of lipid accumulation and glucose homeostasis. The impact of obesity and obesity-associated type 2 diabetes as well as the potential regulatory role of insulin and leptin on aquaglyceroporins (AQP) 3, 7, and 9 were analyzed. The tissue distribution and expression of AQP in biopsies of omental and sc adipose tissue as well as liver were analyzed in lean and obese Caucasian volunteers (n = 63). The effect of insulin (1, 10, and 100 nmol/liter) and leptin (0.1, 1, and 10 nmol/liter) on the expression of the glycerol channels was determined in vitro in human omental adipocytes and HepG2 hepatocytes. The translocation of AQP in response to insulin and isoproterenol was analyzed by immunocytochemistry. In addition to the well-known expression of AQP7 in adipose tissue, AQP3 and AQP9 were also expressed in both omental and sc adipose tissue. Obese type 2 diabetes patients showed higher expression of AQP in visceral adipose tissue and lower expression of AQP7 in sc adipose tissue and hepatic AQP9. The staining of AQP9 in the plasma membrane of adipocytes was reinforced by insulin, whereas isoproterenol induced the translocation of AQP3 and AQP7 from the lipid droplets to the plasma membrane. Insulin up-regulated all AQP, whereas leptin up-regulated AQP3 and down-regulated AQP7 and AQP9 in adipocytes and hepatocytes. These effects were abrogated by both the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin and the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor rapamycin. Our findings show, for the first time, that insulin and leptin regulate the AQP through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway in human visceral adipocytes and hepatocytes. AQP3 and AQP7 may facilitate glycerol efflux from adipose tissue while reducing the glycerol influx into hepatocytes via AQP9 to prevent the excessive lipid accumulation and the subsequent aggravation of hyperglycemia in human obesity.",

    "title": "Regulation of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in rat white adipose tissue upon chronic central leptin infusion: effects on adiposity.",
    "abstract": "Leptin enhances the glucose utilization in most insulin target tissues and paradoxically decreases it in white adipose tissue (WAT), but knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of central leptin on the insulin-dependent glucose uptake in WAT is limited. After 7 d intracerebroventricular leptin treatment (0.2 &#x3bc;g/d) of rats, the overall insulin sensitivity and the responsiveness of WAT after acute in vivo insulin administration were analyzed. We also performed unilateral WAT denervation to clarify the role of the autonomic nervous system in leptin effects on the insulin-stimulated [(3)H]-2-deoxyglucose transport in WAT. Central leptin improved the overall insulin sensitivity but decreased the in vivo insulin action in WAT, including insulin receptor autophosphorylation, insulin receptor substrate-1 tyrosine-phosphorylation, and Akt activation. In this tissue, insulin receptor substrate-1 and glucose transporter 4 mRNA and protein levels were down-regulated after central leptin treatment. Additionally, a remarkable up-regulation of resistin, together with an augmented expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 in WAT, was also observed in leptin-treated rats. As a result, the insulin-stimulated glucose transporter 4 insertion at the plasma membrane and the glucose uptake in WAT were impaired in leptin-treated rats. Finally, denervation of WAT abolished the inhibitory effect of central leptin on glucose transport and decreased suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 and resistin levels in this tissue, suggesting that resistin, in an autocrine/paracrine manner, might be a mediator of central leptin antagonism of insulin action in WAT. We conclude that central leptin, inhibiting the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in WAT, may regulate glucose availability for triacylglyceride formation and accumulation in this tissue, thereby contributing to the control of adiposity.",

    "abstract": "Although leptin has been found to be implicated in obesity-related breast carcinogenesis in postmenopausal women, the molecular mechanisms involved are yet to be defined. Recently, the antiapoptotic gene survivin has been recognized as a target gene for leptin in breast cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of leptin on the expression of survivin and on the transcriptional activity of its promoter in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. We also studied the potential involvement of SOCS-3 (a negative regulator of leptin's main signaling pathway JAK2/STAT3) in the expression of leptin-mediated survivin. Our results showed a significant increase in the mRNA (dose-dependent increase of 40-70%) and protein expression levels of survivin 24 h post-leptin treatment, which was followed by a significant decrease at 48 and 72 h (of 60-70%). In accordance, a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed an initial strong binding of STAT3 to the survivin promoter, which was no longer detected after 24 h. Myc/mad/max network proteins and histone H3 acetylation status were not found to contribute to the expression of leptin-mediated survivin. Furthermore, a protein immunoprecipitation assay detected an enhanced SOCS-3 binding to the long isoform of leptin's receptor (Ob-Rb) 48 and 72 h after leptin administration, thus conferring inhibition to leptin signaling. In conclusion, our findings suggest, for the first time to our knowledge, that the effect of leptin on the antiapoptotic gene survivin is limited by the inhibitory role of SOCS-3 in the leptin-activated JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "A low birth-weight (LBW) offspring exhibits reduced hypothalamic neural satiety pathways and dysregulated signaling leading to programmed hyperphagia and adult obesity. Hypothalamic appetite circuits develop during early life, under the influence of neurotrophic hormones (leptin and insulin). Notably, LBW newborns have reduced plasma leptin and insulin levels. As neurons and glia arise from neuronal progenitor cells (NPC), we postulated that a programmed impairment of NPCs may contribute to reduced hypothalamic neural pathway development in a LBW offspring. Control dams received ad libitum food, whereas study dams were 50% food-restricted from pregnancy day 10 to 21 (LBW). At day 1 of age, hypothalamic NPCs were cultured as neurospheres (NS) and treated with leptin/insulin. We analyzed in vitro NPC proliferation and differentiation into neurons/astrocytes, expression of signal molecules promoting proliferation (activated Notch1 and its downstream target, Hes1) and in vivo NPC proliferation and migration. LBW offspring had impaired in vivo evidence of NPC division and migration, and reduced in vitro evidence of proliferation and differentiation to neurons and astrocytes, under basal and stimulated conditions. The reduced Notch1 and Hes1 expression in LBW neurosphere, under both basal and stimulated conditions, suggests a reduced progenitor cell population or reduced cell density within the neurosphere.",

Adipose tissue and skeletal muscle are a source of signalling proteins (adipokines and myokines), some of which have been related to the control of insulin sensitivity. Here, we investigated the possible differential effects of elaidic acid (EA; trans-9-18&#xa0;:&#xa0;1) - the major component in industrially produced TFA - and oleic acid (OA; cis-9-18&#xa0;:&#xa0;1) - its cis-isomer naturally present in food - on cellular glucose uptake and the expression of selected myokines and adipokines using cell models.

In C2C12 myotubes, pretreatment with OA, but not with EA, led to increased insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake and IL-6 expression levels, while pretreatment with EA, but not with OA, led to reduced IL-15 mRNA levels and increased TNF-&#x3b1; expression levels. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, exposure to OA, but not to EA, resulted in reduced resistin gene expression and increased adiponectin gene expression. The results show evidence of distinct, direct effects of OA and EA on muscle glucose uptake and the expression of target myokines and adipokines, thus suggesting novel mechanisms by which cis- and trans-monounsaturated fat may differentially affect systemic functions.",

    "abstract": "White adipose tissue (WAT) is now considered a defined tissue capable of interactions with other organ systems. WAT role in elevating the level of systemic chronic inflammation suggests that alterations in this tissue as the result of disease or environmental factors may influence the development and progression of various obesity-related pathologies. This study investigated WAT cell-specific responses to an organometal compound, trimethyltin (TMT), to determine possible contribution to induced inflammation. Human primary mature adipocytes and macrophage differentiated THP-1 cells were cultured in TMT presence and relative toxicities and different adipokine levels were determined. The inflammatory response was examined in TMT presence for primary cells from obese ob/ob mice WAT, and after TMT injection in ob/ob mice. Both adipocytes and macrophages were resistant to cell death induced by TMT. However, adipocytes cultured in TMT presence showed increased expression of TNF&#x3b1; and IL-6, and modified leptin levels. In macrophage cultures, TMT also increased TNF&#x3b1; and IL-6, while MCP-1 and MIP-1&#x3b1; were decreased. In vivo, a single injection of TMT in ob/ob mice, elevated TNF&#x3b1;, MIP-1&#x3b1; and adiponectin in WAT. Elevation of the inflammatory related products can be induced by chemical exposure in adipocytes and macrophages, as well as murine WAT. These data suggest that numerous factors, including a systemic chemical exposure, can induce an inflammatory response from the WAT. Furthermore, when characterizing both chemical-induced toxicity and the progression of the chronic inflammation associated with elevated WAT content, such responses in this target tissue should be taken into consideration.",

    "abstract": "Insulin resistance is an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Inflammation plays an important role in insulin resistance, and adipocytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha and leptin, can induce insulin resistance. However, data on insulin resistance and erythropoietin responsiveness in HD patients are lacking. We conducted a prospective, observational cohort study to clarify the relationship between insulin resistance and erythropoietin responsiveness in HD patients. Insulin resistance as assessed by the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), levels of adiponectin and inflammatory cytokines, required erythropoietin (EPO) dose, and other metabolic parameters were measured in patients with (n = 52) and without diabetes (n = 55) over the course of 12 months. The diabetes group had significantly higher serum leptin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 concentrations but lower serum adiponectin concentration. Average hemoglobin (Hb) levels during the 12-month study period were significantly lower in the diabetes group than in the non-diabetes group, and a higher dose of EPO was required in the diabetes group. There was a significant negative correlation between adiponectin and HOMA-IR, a significant positive correlation between EPO dose and HOMA-IR, and a significant negative correlation between EPO dose and adiponectin in the two groups. Insulin resistance as established by HOMA-IR and adiponectin was associated with EPO responsiveness in HD patients. HOMA-IR, Hb, and adiponectin levels were found to be independent predictors of EPO dose in HD patients with diabetes. Insulin resistance is associated with EPO responsiveness in HD patients. Patients in the diabetes group had a lower response to EPO than those in the non-diabetes group. For improvement in EPO response, insulin resistance may be a new target for treating HD patients.",

    "title": "Leptin activates a novel CNS mechanism for insulin-independent normalization of severe diabetic hyperglycemia.",
    "abstract": "The brain has emerged as a target for the insulin-sensitizing effects of several hormonal and nutrient-related signals. The current studies were undertaken to investigate mechanisms whereby leptin lowers circulating blood glucose levels independently of insulin. After extending previous evidence that leptin infusion directly into the lateral cerebral ventricle ameliorates hyperglycemia in rats with streptozotocin-induced uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, we showed that the underlying mechanism is independent of changes of food intake, urinary glucose excretion, or recovery of pancreatic &#x3b2;-cells. Instead, leptin action in the brain potently suppresses hepatic glucose production while increasing tissue glucose uptake despite persistent, severe insulin deficiency. This leptin action is distinct from its previously reported effect to increase insulin sensitivity in the liver and offers compelling evidence that the brain has the capacity to normalize diabetic hyperglycemia in the presence of sufficient amounts of central nervous system leptin.",

    "title": "Daidzein supplementation prevents non-alcoholic fatty liver disease through alternation of hepatic gene expression profiles and adipocyte metabolism.",
    "abstract": "Globally, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) continues to rise and isoflavones exert antisteatotic effects by the regulation of hepatic lipogenesis/insulin resistance or adiposity/a variety of adipocytokines are related to hepatic steatosis. However, there is very little information regarding the potential effects of daidzein, the secondary abundant isoflavone, on NAFLD. Here, we have assessed the hepatic global transcription profiles, adipocytokines and adiposity in mice with high fat-induced NAFLD and their alteration by daidzein supplementation. C57BL/6J mice were fed with normal fat (16% fat of total energy), high fat (HF; 36% fat of total energy) and HF supplemented with daidzein (0.1, 0.5, 1 and 2 g per kg diet) for 12 weeks. Daidzein supplementation (&#x2265; 0.5 g per kg diet) reduced hepatic lipid concentrations and alleviated hepatic steatosis. The hepatic microarray showed that daidzein supplementation (1 g per kg diet) downregulated carbohydrate responsive element binding protein, a determinant of de novo lipogenesis, its upstream gene liver X receptor &#x3b2; and its target genes encoding for lipogenic enzymes, thereby preventing hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. These results were confirmed by lower insulin and blood glucose levels as well as homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance scores. In addition, daidzein supplementation inhibited adiposity by the upregulation of genes involved in fatty acid &#x3b2;-oxidation and the antiadipogeneis, and moreover augmented antisteatohepatitic leptin and adiponectin mRNA levels, whereas it reduced the mRNA or concentration of steatotic tumor necrosis factor &#x3b1; and ghrelin. These findings show that daidzein might alleviate NAFLD through the direct regulation of hepatic de novo lipogenesis and insulin signaling, and the indirect control of adiposity and adipocytokines by the alteration of adipocyte metabolism.",

    "abstract": "There is a discrepancy between the in&#xa0;vitro anergic state of CD4(+)CD25(hi)FoxP3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells and their in&#xa0;vivo proliferative capability. The underlying mechanism of this paradox is unknown. Here we show that the anergic state of Treg cells depends on the elevated activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway induced by leptin: a transient inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin, before T&#xa0;cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, made Treg cells highly proliferative in the absence of exogenous interleukin-2 (IL-2). This was a dynamic and oscillatory phenomenon characterized by an early downregulation of the leptin-mTOR pathway followed by an increase in mTOR activation necessary for Treg cell expansion to occur. These data suggest that energy metabolism, through the leptin-mTOR-axis, sets responsiveness of Treg cells that use this information to control immune tolerance and autoimmunity.",

    "title": "Differential metabolic effects of distinct statins.",
    "abstract": "Reciprocal relationships between endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance suggest that therapies improving endothelial dysfunction will simultaneously improve insulin sensitivity and other metabolic parameters. However, previous studies with some statins either did not alter insulin sensitivity or promoted insulin resistance despite significant improvements in endothelial dysfunction and decreases in circulating pro-inflammatory markers. This may be due to pleiotropic or off-target effects of some statins to cause insulin resistance by diverse mechanisms unrelated to endothelial dysfunction. Indeed, there is evidence of other differential metabolic actions of distinct statins including effects on hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibition, isoprotenoid synthesis, calcium release, glucose transport, insulin secretion, and/or insulin resistance. Pravastatin increases expression of adiponectin mRNA, enhances adiponectin secretion, increases plasma levels of adiponectin, and enhances insulin sensitivity in mice and humans. Clinical studies including large scale randomized controlled trials demonstrate potential differences between individual statins, with pravastatin promoting risk reduction for new onset of diabetes. Conversely, other statins including atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin all promote significant increase in this risk. Given the frequent concordance of metabolic diseases including diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome with cardiovascular diseases associated with hyperlipidemia, it is important to understand the potential metabolic risks and benefits of therapies with distinct statins. In this review, we discuss these differential effects of statins on metabolic homeostasis and insulin sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "The transcriptional corepressor SMRT utilizes two major receptor-interacting domains (RID1 and RID2) to mediate nuclear receptor (NR) signaling through epigenetic modification. The physiological significance of such interaction remains unclear. We find SMRT expression and its occupancy on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) target gene promoters are increased with age in major metabolic tissues. Genetic manipulations to selectively disable RID1 (SMRT(mRID1)) demonstrate that shifting SMRT repression to RID2-associated NRs, notably PPARs, causes premature aging and related metabolic diseases accompanied by reduced mitochondrial function and antioxidant gene expression. SMRT(mRID1) cells exhibit increased susceptibility to oxidative damage, which could be rescued by PPAR activation or antioxidant treatment. In concert, several human Smrt gene polymorphisms are found to nominally associate with type 2 diabetes and adiponectin levels. These data uncover a role for SMRT in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and the aging process, which may serve as a drug target to improve health span.",

Reductions in albuminuria were also similar (50%). Only olmesartan/amlodipine reduced the insulin resistance index (24%, P&lt;0.01), increased plasma adiponectin (16%, P&lt;0.05) and significantly reduced all of the inflammation markers studied, except CRP, which showed a similar reduction in each group. The risk of new-onset diabetes was significantly lower with olmesartan/amlodipine (P=0.02).

    "abstract": "To evaluate the role of leptin in the internal disorders during hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury. A rat model of 70% hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury was established, with groups of sham-operation (Sham), 60 min ischemia/60 min reperfusion (I60'R60'), I60'R150', I60'R240' and I60'R360'. Serum leptin was detected by a self-produced radioimmunoassay; serum glucose, total anti-oxidation capacity, myeloperoxidase, alanine transaminase and diamine oxidase were determined by relevant kits, while histological alterations and protein levels of leptin in the lung, liver and duodenum were examined by hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemistry. Spearman's rank correlation between leptin and other variables or grading of tissue impairment were analyzed simultaneously. Serum leptin in I60'R360' was significantly higher than in Sham and I60'R240' groups (both P &lt; 0.05), serum glucose in I60'R360' was higher than in Sham and I60'R150' (both P &lt; 0.05), and serum total anti-oxidation capacity in I60'R240' and I60'R360' were higher than in Sham (both P &lt; 0.05) and I60'R150'groups (both P &lt; 0.01). Serum myeloperoxidase in groups of I60'R240' and I60'R360' were lower than in I60'R150'group (both P &lt; 0.05), serum alanine transaminase in the four reperfusion groups were higher than in the Sham group (all P &lt; 0.05), while serum DAO in I60'R360' was lower than in I60'R60' (P &lt; 0.05). Histological impairment in the lung, liver and duodenum at the early phase of this injury was more serious, but the impairment at the later phase was lessened gradually. Protein levels of leptin in the lung in the four reperfusion groups were significantly lower than in the Sham group (all P &lt; 0.01), decreasing in the order of I60'R150', I60'R60', I60'R360' and I60'R240'; the levels in the liver in I60'R60' and I60'R240' were higher than in the Sham group (both P &lt; 0.01), while the levels in I60'R240' and I60'R360' were lower than in I60'R60' (both P &lt; 0.01); the levels in duodenum in I60'R240' and I60'R360' were higher than in Sham, I60'R60' and I60'R150' (all P &lt; 0.01), while the level in I60'R150' was lower than in I60'R60' (P &lt; 0.05).

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant intracranial tumour that develops in both adults and children. Microarray gene analyses have confirmed that the human YKL-40 gene is one of the most over-expressed genes in these tumours but not in normal brain tissue. Clinical studies have shown that serum YKL-40 levels are positively correlated with tumour burden in addition to being an independent prognostic factor of a short relapse-free interval as well as short overall survival in patients with various cancers. Our previous study revealed that YKL-40 was closely correlated with the pathological grades of human primary astrocytomas and played a crucial role in glioma cell proliferation. Hence, YKL-40 could be an attractive target in the design of anti-cancer therapies. Cell viability and invasion assays were performed to detect the cell proliferation and invasive ability of U87 cells induced by resveratrol (3, 5, 4'-trihydroxystilbene; Res) or YKL-40 small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs). In addition, the luciferase assay, real-time RT-PCR, western blotting, and ELISA were used to measure YKL-40 promoter activity, mRNA, and protein expression, respectively. The expressions of phosphor-ERK1/2 and ERK1/2 were determined by western blotting. Res inhibited U87 cell proliferation and invasion in vitro and repressed YKL-40 in U87 cells by decreasing the activity of its promoter and reducing mRNA transcription and protein expression in vitro. YKL-40 siRNA treatment also impaired the invasiveness of U87 cells. When U87 cells were cultured with 20 &#x3bc;M PD98059 (an ERK1/2 inhibitor) alone, with 20 &#x3bc;M PD98059 and 100 &#x3bc;M Res, or with 100 &#x3bc;M Res alone for 48 h, YKL-40 protein expression decreased most significantly in the Res-treated group. PD98059 partially reversed the decrease of YKL-40 protein expression induced by Res. Furthermore, phosphor-ERK1/2 expression was reduced by Res treatment in a time-dependent manner. We demonstrated for the first time that Res represses YKL-40 expression in vitro; in addition, the ERK1/2 pathway is involved in this repression. This finding could extend the prospective use of Res in glioma research and enlarge the armamentarium for treating gliomas.",

    "abstract": "Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is a multifunctional protein with neurotrophic and anti-angiogenic properties. More recently it became evident that PEDF is upregulated in patients with type 2 diabetes and also contributes to insulin resistance in mice. During characterization of the secretome of in vitro differentiated human adipocytes by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-MS, we found that PEDF is one of the most abundant proteins released by adipocytes. The aim of this study was to investigate the regulation and autocrine function of PEDF in human adipocytes and to determine its paracrine effects on human skeletal muscle cells (hSkMC) and human smooth muscle cells (hSMC). Human primary adipocytes secrete 130 ng ml(-1) PEDF over 24 h from 1 million cells, which is extremely high as compared with adiponectin, interleukin-6 (IL-6) or IL-8. This release of PEDF is significantly higher than from other primary cells, such as adipose-tissue located macrophages (50-times), hSkMC and hSMC (5-times). PEDF protein expression significantly increases during adipogenesis, which is paralleled by increased PEDF secretion. Furthermore, tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1; and hypoxia significantly downregulate PEDF protein levels. PEDF secretion was significantly reduced by troglitazone and hypoxia and significantly increased by insulin. Treatment of adipocytes and hSkMC with PEDF induced insulin resistance in adipocytes, skeletal and smooth muscle cells at the level of insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation, which was dose dependent and more prominent in adipocytes. Furthermore, inflammatory nuclear factor-&#x3ba;B (NF-&#x3ba;B) signaling was induced by PEDF. In hSMC, PEDF induced proliferation (1.7-fold) and acutely activated proliferative and inflammatory signaling pathways (NF-&#x3ba;B, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin). PEDF is one of the most abundant adipokines and its secretion is inversely regulated by insulin and hypoxia. PEDF induces insulin resistance in adipocytes and hSkMC and leads to inflammatory signaling in hSMC. Because of these diverse actions, PEDF is a key adipokine, which could have an important role in diabetes and obesity-related disorders.",

As sepsis progresses immune paralysis can become severe, leaving an already vulnerable patient ill equipped to eradicate primary or secondary infections. At present the predominant treatments for sepsis have not demonstrated convincing efficacy of decreased mortality. During sepsis, it has been observed that leptin levels initially increase but subsequently decline. A body of evidence has demonstrated that central or systemic leptin can beneficially regulate immune function. In this report expression of leptin and its receptor, signaling, and function on leukocytes will be reviewed. Furthermore, the effects mediated by central and systemic leptin during sepsis will be reviewed. Altogether, the ability of leptin to beneficially enhance inflammation and the host response during sepsis supports its use as a therapeutic agent, particularly during the latter phases of the syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Visceral adipocytes and associated macrophages produce and release excessive amounts of biologically active inflammatory cytokines via the portal and systemic vascular system, which induce insulin resistance in insulin target tissues such as fat, liver, and muscle. Free fatty acids (FFAs) absorbed via the portal system or released from adipocytes also induce insulin resistance. In this report, we show that phenylmethimazole (C10) blocks basal IL6 and leptin production as well as basal Socs-3 expression in fully differentiated 3T3L1 cells (3T3L1 adipocytes) without affecting insulin-stimulated AKT signaling. In addition, C10 inhibits palmitate-induced IL6 and iNos up-regulation in both 3T3L1 adipocytes and RAW 264.7 macrophages, LPS-induced NF-&#x3ba;B and IFN-&#x3b2; activation in 3T3L1 cells, and LPS-induced iNos, Ifn-&#x3b2;, Il1&#x3b2;, Cxcl10, and Il6 expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages. C10 also blocks palmitate-induced Socs-3 up-regulation and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) serine 307 phosphorylation in 3T3L1 adipocytes. Additionally, we show for the first time that although palmitate increases IRS-1 serine 307 phosphorylation in 3T3L1 adipocytes, AKT serine 473 phosphorylation is enhanced, not reduced, by palmitate. These results suggest that through inhibition of FFA-mediated signaling in adipocytes and associated macrophages, as well as possibly other insulin target cells/tissues (i.e. non-immune cells), C10 might be efficacious to prevent or reverse cytokine-induced insulin resistance seen in obesity-related insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

    "title": "Mechanisms of adiponectin regulation and use as a pharmacological target.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin is an insulin-sensitizing and anti-inflammatory fat cell hormone that has immense potential as a therapeutic target for a multitude of obesity-associated diseases, including type 2 diabetes, NASH and atherosclerosis (Chandran M, Phillips SA, Ciaraldi T, Henry RR: Adiponectin: more than just another fat cell hormone?Diabetes Care 2003, 26:2442-2450). The adiponectin gene is located in chromosome 3q27, a susceptibility locus for T2DM and metabolic disorders (Saito K, Tobe T, Minoshima S, Asakawa S, Sumiya J, Yoda M, Nakano Y, Shimizu N, Tomita M: Organization of the gene for gelatin-binding protein (GBP28). Gene 1999, 229:67-73). Increased circulating levels of adiponectin are associated with improvement in the metabolic syndrome and reductions are strongly predictive of diabetes risk (Li S, Shin HJ, Ding EL, van Dam RM: Adiponectin levels and risk of type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis. JAMA 2009, 302:179-188. Extensive efforts have been made to understand how adiponectin levels can be elevated. The complex post-translational processing and secretion of adiponectin provides a rich area where pharmacologic manipulation may be developed to increase adiponectin levels in humans. Circulating adiponectin levels are increased by many commonly used drugs, such as statins, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones (TZDs) providing an important opportunity to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying their effects. This review describes the cellular processes by which adiponectin is synthesized and secreted, current therapeutics known to affect this pathway and the potential for therapeutic manipulation in human subjects.",

    "title": "Hepatic gene expression profiling reveals key pathways involved in leptin-mediated weight loss in ob/ob mice.",
    "abstract": "Leptin, a cytokine-like protein, plays an important role in the regulation of body weight through inhibition of food intake and stimulation of energy expenditure. Leptin circulates in blood and acts on the brain, which sends downstream signals to regulate body weight. Leptin therapy has been successful in treating leptin deficient obese patients. However, high levels of leptin have been observed in more common forms of obesity indicating a state of leptin resistance which limits the application of leptin in the treatment of obesity. If the central effect of leptin could be by-passed and genes which respond to leptin treatment could be regulated directly, new therapeutic targets for the treatment of obesity may be possible. The purpose of this study was to identify genes and subsequent pathways correlated with leptin-mediated weight loss. WE UTILIZED MICROARRAY TECHNOLOGY TO COMPARE HEPATIC GENE EXPRESSION CHANGES AFTER TWO TYPES OF LEPTIN ADMINISTRATION: one involving a direct stimulatory effect when administered peripherally (subcutaneous: SQ) and another that is indirect, involving a hypothalamic relay that suppresses food intake when leptin is administered centrally (intracerebroventricular: ICV). We identified 214 genes that correlate with leptin mediated weight loss. Several biological processes such as mitochondrial metabolic pathways, lipid metabolic and catabolic processes, lipid biosynthetic processes, carboxylic acid metabolic processes, iron ion binding and glutathione S-transferases were downregulated after leptin administration. In contrast, genes involved in the immune system inflammatory response and lysosomal activity were found to be upregulated. Among the cellular compartments mitochondrion (32 genes), endoplasmic reticulum (22 genes) and vacuole (8 genes) were significantly over represented. In this study we have identified key molecular pathways and downstream genes which respond to leptin treatment and are involved in leptin-mediated weight loss. Many of these genes have previously been shown to be associated with obesity; however, we have also identified a number of other novel target genes. Further investigation will be required to assess the possible use of these genes and their associated protein products as therapeutic targets for the treatment of obesity.",

    "abstract": "Puerarin, a major isoflavone glycoside from Kudzu root (Pueraria lobata), has been reported to exert antihyperglycemic and antioxidant effects and thus have pharmacological actions in the treatment of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. We investigated the effects of puerarin on the changes of key gene expression associated with adipocyte differentiation and insulin sensitivity and link to cellular antioxidant response pathways. Puerarin treatment significantly enhanced differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes accompanying increased lipid accumulation and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) activity. At a molecular level, puerarin upregulated mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x3b3; (PPAR&#x3b3;) and its target genes, an adipocyte-specific fatty acid binding protein (aP2) and GLUT4. Puerarin also caused a significant increase in mRNA level of adiponectin, an important insulin-sensitizing adipocytokine that is downregulated in insulin-resistant and diabetic states. In addition, treatment with puerarin was found to upregulate mRNA levels of G6PDH, glutathione reductase, and catalase, all of which are important for endogenous antioxidant responses. These data suggest that the hypoglycemic effects of puerarin can be attributed to the upregulation of PPAR&#x3b3; and its downstream target genes, GLUT4 and adiponectin expression, leading to increased glucose utilization. Puerarin may also be effective in preventing the rise of oxidative stress during adipocyte differentiation by increasing endogenous antioxidant responses.",

    "abstract": "The mechanism by which the adipokine zinc-&#x3b1;2-glycoprotein (ZAG) increases the mass of gastrocnemius, but not soleus muscle of diabetic mice, has been evaluated both in vivo and in vitro. There was an increased phosphorylation of both double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase and its substrate, eukaryotic initiation factor-2&#x3b1;, which was attenuated by about two-thirds in gastrocnemius but not soleus muscle of ob/ob mice treated with ZAG (50 &#x3bc;g, iv daily) for 5 d. ZAG also reduced the expression of the phospho forms of p38MAPK and phospholipase A2, as well as expression of the ubiquitin ligases (E3) muscle atrophy F-box/atrogin-1 and muscle RING finger protein, and the increased activity of both caspase-3 and casapse-8 to values found in nonobese controls. ZAG also increased the levels of phospho serine-threonine kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin in gastrocnemius muscle and reduced the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (Ser307) associated with insulin resistance. Similar changes were seen with ZAG when murine myotubes were incubated with high glucose concentrations (10 and 25 mm), showing that the effect of ZAG was direct. ZAG produced an increase in cAMP in murine myotubes, and the effects of ZAG on protein synthesis and degradation in vitro could be replicated by dibutyryl cAMP. ZAG increased cAMP levels of gastrocnemius but not soleus muscle. These results suggest that protein accretion in skeletal muscle in response to ZAG may be due to changes in intracellular cAMP and also that ZAG may have a therapeutic application in the treatment of muscle wasting conditions.",

    "abstract": "High levels of the adipocytokine leptin are associated with reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease. Leptin treatment also reduces &#x3b2;-amyloid (A&#x3b2;) levels in in vivo and in vitro models of Alzheimer's disease. A&#x3b2; and leptin interact with the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. Akt/mTORC1 activation reduces tau phosphorylation through the inhibition of the downstream enzyme GSK-3&#x3b2;. mTORC1 also regulates translation of many proteins including leptin. While A&#x3b2; has been shown to inactivate Akt, inhibit mTORC1, and facilitate the phosphorylation of tau, leptin activates both Akt and mTORC1 and reduces tau phosphorylation. However, the extent to which A&#x3b2; may modulate leptin expression and increase tau phosphorylation involving Akt/mTORC1 has not been determined. In this study, we show that incubation of organotypic slices from rabbit hippocampus with A&#x3b2; down-regulates leptin expression, inhibits Akt, activates GSK-3&#x3b2;, increases tau phosphorylation, and inactivates mTORC1. Leptin treatment reverses A&#x3b2; effects by alleviating Akt inhibition, preventing GSK-3&#x3b2; activation, reducing tau phosphorylation, and activating mTORC1. On the other hand, Rapamycin, an allosteric inhibitor of mTORC1, down-regulates leptin expression, increases tau phosphorylation, and does not affect Akt and GSK-3&#x3b2;. Our results demonstrate for the first time that A&#x3b2; regulates leptin expression and tau phosphorylation through mTORC1.",

    "title": "The CB-1 receptor antagonist rimonabant modulates the interaction between adipocytes and pancreatic beta-cells in vitro.",
    "abstract": "Adipocytes produce signalling molecules which can act on target cells including pancreatic beta-cells. In previous studies we found adipocytes to directly stimulate insulin secretion and the proliferation of pancreatic beta-cells in vitro. Rimonabant acts as an antagonist at the cannabinoid-1 (CB-1) receptor which is expressed on adipocytes. Rimonabant decreases insulin levels in vivo. This effect can either be explained by improving insulin sensitivity or by effects on beta-cells including the modulation of adipocyte - beta-cell interactions. To test how pre-treatment of primary human adipocytes with rimonabant affects the cross-talk between adipocytes and pancreatic beta-cells in vitro. Rimonabant had no direct effect on insulin secretion or beta-cell proliferation at a concentration range from 1 nM to 1 &#x3bc;M. This is in line with previous findings showing that in the murine pancreas CB-1 receptors are preferentially expressed on non-beta-cells, while rimonabant is a selective blocker of CB-1 receptors. We found fat-cell conditioned-medium without (FCCM) and after pre-treatment for 24 h with 100 nM rimonabant (FCCM-RB) to induce insulin secretion from primary murine beta-cells to a similar extent. Proliferation of a pancreatic beta-cell line was enhanced by FCCM to 219%, while FCCM-RB inhibited proliferation to 53%. As we previously found Wnt-signalling to mediate effects of adipocytes on beta-cell proliferation we tested the ability of FCCM and FCCM-RB to activate canonical Wnt-signalling in target cells. However, there was no significant difference between the groups: FCCM and FCCM-RB stimulated Wnt reporter gene activity to 181% and 179%, respectively. In addition, there was no significant difference in adiponectin levels between FCCM and FCCM-RB (56.8 vs. 58.1 ng/ml), showing that adiponectin does not mediate the differential effects on beta-cell proliferation by FCCM and FCCM-RB. Our data show that rimonabant modulates the adipocyte - beta-cell interaction with respect to beta-cell proliferation and indicate that signalling molecules other than adiponectin and components of the Wnt pathway mediate this cross-talk.",

    "title": "Estrogen receptor-{beta}-selective ligands alleviate high-fat diet- and ovariectomy-induced obesity in mice.",
    "abstract": "Obesity is an epidemic problem affecting millions of people in the Western hemisphere and costs the United States economy more than $200 billion annually. Currently, there are no effective treatments to combat obesity. Recent studies have implicated the constitutive activity of estrogen receptor (ER) &#x3b2; as an important regulator of metabolic diseases. However, the potential of ER-&#x3b2;-selective ligands to offset obesity is not clear. We evaluated the pharmacological effect of ER-&#x3b2;-selective ligands (&#x3b2;-LGNDs) in animal models of high-fat diet- and ovariectomy-induced obesity. Ligand binding, transactivation, and uterotrophic studies with &#x3b2;-LGNDs demonstrated selectivity for ER-&#x3b2; over ER-&#x3b1;. Animals fed a high-fat diet showed a significant increase in body weight, and this weight gain was attenuated by &#x3b2;-LGNDs. High-fat diet-mediated increases in serum cholesterol, leptin, glucose, and fat accumulation in organs were also reduced by &#x3b2;-LGNDs. In addition, MRI scanning indicated that &#x3b2;-LGNDs altered body composition by reducing fat mass and increasing lean body mass. Organ weights and gene expression analyses demonstrated that adipose tissue is the center of action for &#x3b2;-LGNDs, and the reduction in body weight is likely due to increased energy expenditure. In vitro and in vivo mechanistic studies indicated that the anti-obesity effects of &#x3b2;-LGNDs were due to indirect peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x3b3; antagonistic actions requiring the ligand binding domain of ER-&#x3b2; and through abrogation of the ability of PGC-1 to coactivate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x3b3;. In conclusion, these studies indicate that ligand-activated ER-&#x3b2; is a potential therapeutic target to combat obesity and obesity-related metabolic diseases.",

    "title": "Metformin: taking away the candy for cancer?",
    "abstract": "Metformin is widely used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2 where it reduces insulin resistance and diabetes-related morbidity and mortality. Population-based studies show that metformin treatment is associated with a dose-dependent reduction in cancer risk. The metformin treatment also increases complete pathological tumour response rates following neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer, suggesting a potential role as an anti-cancer drug. Diabetes mellitus type 2 is associated with insulin resistance, elevated insulin levels and an increased risk of cancer and cancer-related mortality. This increased risk may be explained by activation of the insulin- and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signalling pathways and increased signalling through the oestrogen receptor. Reversal of these processes through reduction of insulin resistance by the oral anti-diabetic drug metformin is an attractive anti-cancer strategy. Metformin is an activator of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) which inhibits protein synthesis and gluconeogenesis during cellular stress. The main downstream effect of AMPK activation is the inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a downstream effector of growth factor signalling. mTOR is frequently activated in malignant cells and is associated with resistance to anticancer drugs. Furthermore, metformin can induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and can reduce growth factor signalling. This review discusses the role of diabetes mellitus type 2 and insulin resistance in carcinogenesis, the preclinical rationale and potential mechanisms of metformin's anti-cancer effect and the current and future clinical developments of metformin as a novel anti-cancer drug.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological studies have shown that obesity is a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Lower adiponectin levels are associated with poor prognosis in obese HCC patients, hence it is plausible that adiponectin acts as a negative regulator of HCC. We investigated the effects of adiponectin on HCC development and its molecular mechanisms. Assays with Huh7 and HepG2 HCC cells were used to examine the signal transduction pathways involved in the protective functions of adiponectin in HCC. These studies were followed by in vivo approaches using HCC xenografts and tumor analysis. Results from in vitro and in vivo findings were corroborated using human HCC tissue microarray and analysis of clinicopathological characteristics. Adiponectin increased apoptosis of HCC cells through activation of caspase-3. Adiponectin increased phosphorylation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) and inhibition of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase-phosphorylation inhibited adiponectin-induced apoptosis and caspase-3 activation. Adiponectin increased phosphorylation of 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and tumor suppressor tuberous sclerosis complex 2 and inhibited mammalian target of rapamycin phosphorylation. Inhibition of 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase phosphorylation not only inhibited adiponectin-induced c-Jun-N-terminal kinase phosphorylation, but also blocked biological effects of adiponectin. Adiponectin substantially reduced liver tumorigenesis in nude mice. Importantly, analysis of adiponectin expression levels in tissue microarray of human HCC patients revealed an inverse correlation of adiponectin expression with tumor size. Adiponectin protects against liver tumorigenesis; its reduced expression is associated with poor prognosis in obese patients with HCC.",

    "abstract": "Obesity and metabolic syndrome result from excess calorie intake and genetic predisposition and are mechanistically linked to type II diabetes and accelerated body aging; abnormal nutrient and insulin signaling participate in this pathologic process, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. Mice lacking the p66 kDa isoform of the Shc adaptor molecule live longer and are leaner than wild-type animals, suggesting that this molecule may have a role in metabolic derangement and premature senescence by overnutrition. We found that p66 deficiency exerts a modest but significant protective effect on fat accumulation and premature death in lepOb/Ob mice, an established genetic model of obesity and insulin resistance; strikingly, however, p66 inactivation improved glucose tolerance in these animals, without affecting (hyper)insulinaemia and independent of body weight. Protection from insulin resistance was cell autonomous, because isolated p66KO preadipocytes were relatively resistant to insulin desensitization by free fatty acids in vitro. Biochemical studies revealed that p66shc promotes the signal-inhibitory phosphorylation of the major insulin transducer IRS-1, by bridging IRS-1 and the mTOR effector p70S6 kinase, a molecule previously linked to obesity-induced insulin resistance. Importantly, IRS-1 was strongly up-regulated in the adipose tissue of p66KO lepOb/Ob mice, confirming that effects of p66 on tissue responsiveness to insulin are largely mediated by this molecule. Taken together, these findings identify p66shc as a major mediator of insulin resistance by excess nutrients, and by extension, as a potential molecular target against the spreading epidemic of obesity and type II diabetes.",

Interestingly, resistin is secreted by adipocytes in mice and rats whereas it is secreted by leukocytes in humans. However, the mechanism behind the effect of resistin on the expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) remains poorly understood. Therefore, we examined regulatory effect of resistin on the induction and cellular modification of Tregs. Both protein and mRNA expression of FoxP3, a representative marker of Tregs, increased in a dose-dependent manner when peripheral blood mononuclear cells were treated with resistin. At the same time, resistin had no direct effect on the induction of FoxP3 in CD4+ T cells, suggesting an indirect role through other cells type(s). Since DCs are an important player in the differentiation of T cells, we focused on the role of DCs in the modulation of Tregs by resistin. Resistin suppressed the expression of interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 and its target cytokines, IL-6, IL-23p19 and IL-12p40, in DCs. Furthermore, FoxP3 expression is increased in CD4+ T cells when co-cultured with DCs and concomitantly treated with resistin. Our results suggest that resistin induces expansion of functional Tregs only when co-cultured with DCs.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to assess the effect of long-term pioglitazone treatment on erythropoietin responsiveness and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic patients on hemodialysis. We conducted a prospective, open-label, parallel-group, controlled study of 63 type 2 diabetic hemodialysis patients who were randomly assigned to two groups: pioglitazone group (P-group; 15-30 mg/day pioglitazone plus conventional oral hypoglycemic agents) and control group (C-group; conventional oral hypoglycemic agents alone). We determined the efficacy of pioglitazone by monitoring anemia, glycemic control, insulin resistance, and levels of inflammatory cytokines and high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin for 96 weeks. Pioglitazone effectively reduced erythropoietin dose and maintained the target hemoglobin levels by improving insulin resistance up to the end of the study. In the P-group, hemoglobin A(1c), glycated albumin, and triglycerides significantly decreased compared with the C-group. There was a significant reduction in homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance and the level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and a significant increase in HMW adiponectin level in the P-group; these changes were significantly different compared with values for the C-group. No serious adverse effects such as hypoglycemia, liver impairment, or heart failure were observed in any of the patients. Pioglitazone treatment resulted in better glycemic control, improved lipid levels, an increase in insulin sensitivity and adiponectin levels, and a decrease in inflammatory markers, thus improving the risk factors of cardiovascular disease. Erythropoietin responsiveness improved with a reduction in erythropoietin dose and may be associated with the improvement in insulin resistance due to long-term pioglitazone treatment.",

    "abstract": "Food intake is regulated by signals from peripheral organs, but the way these are integrated remains uncertain. Cholecystokinin (CCK) from the intestine and leptin from adipocytes interact to inhibit food intake. Our aim was to examine the hypothesis that these interactions occur at the level of vagal afferent neurons via control of the immediate early gene EGR1. We now report that CCK stimulates redistribution to the nucleus of early growth response factor-1 (EGR1) in these neurons in vivo and in culture, and these effects are not dependent on EGR1 synthesis. Leptin stimulates EGR1 expression; leptin alone does not stimulate nuclear translocation, but it strongly potentiates the action of CCK. Ghrelin inhibits CCK-stimulated nuclear translocation of EGR1 and leptin-stimulated EGR1 expression. Expression of the gene encoding the satiety peptide cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CARTp) is stimulated by CCK via an EGR1-dependent mechanism, and this is strongly potentiated by leptin. Leptin potentiated inhibition of food intake by endogenous CCK in the rat in conditions reflecting changes in EGR1 activation. The data indicate that by separately regulating EGR1 activation and synthesis, CCK and leptin interact cooperatively to define the capacity for satiety signaling by vagal afferent neurons; manipulation of these interactions may be therapeutically beneficial.",

    "title": "Obesity affects the chondrocyte responsiveness to leptin in patients with osteoarthritis.",
    "abstract": "Increasing evidence support the regulatory role of leptin in osteoarthritis (OA). As high circulating concentrations of leptin disrupt the physiological function of the adipokine in obese individuals, the current study has been undertaken to determine whether the elevated levels of leptin found in the joint from obese OA patients also induce changes in the chondrocyte response to leptin. Chondrocytes isolated from OA patients with various body mass index (BMI) were treated with 20, 100 or 500 ng/ml of leptin. The expression of cartilage-specific components (aggrecan, type 2 collagen), as well as regulatory (IGF-1, TGFbeta, MMP-13, TIMP 2) or inflammatory (COX-2, iNOS, IL-1) factors was investigated by real-time PCR to evaluate chondrocyte responsiveness to leptin. Furthermore, the effect of body mass index (BMI) on leptin signalling pathways was analyzed with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for STATs activation. Leptin at 20 ng/ml was unable to modulate gene expression in chondrocytes, except for MMP-13 in obese OA patients. Higher leptin levels induced the expression of IGF-1, type 2 collagen, TIMP-2 and MMP-13. However, the activity of the adipokine was shown to be critically dependent on both the concentration and the BMI of the patients with a negative association between the activation of regulated genes and BMI for 100 ng/ml of adipokine, but a positive association between chondrocyte responsiveness and BMI for the highest leptin dose. In addition, the gene encoding MMP-13 was identified as a target of leptin for chondrocytes originated from obese patients while mRNA level of TIMP-2 was increased in leptin-treated chondrocytes collected from normal or overweight patients. The adipokine at 500 ng/ml triggered signal transduction through a STAT-dependent pathway while 100 ng/ml of leptin failed to activate STAT 3 but induced STAT 1alpha phosphorylation in chondrocytes obtained from obese patients. The current study clearly showed that characteristics of OA patients and more especially obesity may affect the responsiveness of cultured chondrocytes to leptin. In addition, the BMI-dependent effect of leptin for the expression of TIMP-2 and MMP-13 may explain why obesity is associated with an increased risk for OA.",

    "title": "Anti-inflammatory effect of resveratrol on adipokine expression and secretion in human adipose tissue explants.",
    "abstract": "Human obesity is closely associated with a state of chronic low-grade inflammation, which also involves the adipose tissue with enhanced production of bioactive substances (adipokines). Calorie restriction (CR) reduces adipocytokine production and improves metabolic profile in rodents. Some of these effects are mediated through activation of the sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) enzyme, and in this study, we investigate whether the natural phytoalexin, resveratrol (RSV), which is a potent Sirt1 activator, has anti-inflammatory effects in human adipose tissue explants. The effect of RSV on interleukin 1&#x3b2; (IL1&#x3b2;)-induced change of adipokine mRNA gene expression and secretion were measured in human adipose tissue explants. Exposure of human adipose tissue in vitro to IL1&#x3b2; for 24&#x2009;h increased secretion of the proinflammatory adipokines IL6, IL8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) 3-7.7-fold (P&lt;0.05) and increased IL6, IL8, MCP-1, IL1&#x3b2; and PAI-1 mRNA expression 1.3-7.2-fold (P&lt;0.05) accordingly. Concomitant incubations with RSV reversed the IL1&#x3b2;-stimulated secretion (16-36%) and gene expression (25-48%) of these adipokines. IL1&#x3b2; reduced adiponectin mRNA expression (40%), a decrement that was reversed by RSV treatment. Similar effects were observed in differentiated human preadipocytes in primary culture, indicating that human adipocytes are a potential target for RSV effects. Finally, the effects were neutralized by sirtinol, a Sirt1 inhibitor. This study is the first to show anti-inflammatory effects of RSV on adipokine expression and secretion in human adipose tissue in vitro through the SIRT1 pathway. Thus, RSV is hypothesized to possess beneficial effects and might improve the metabolic profile in human obesity.",

    "abstract": "Insulin resistance is commonly associated with obesity. Studies conducted in obese mouse models found that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress contributes to insulin resistance, and treatment with tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a bile acid derivative that acts as a chemical chaperone to enhance protein folding and ameliorate ER stress, increases insulin sensitivity. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of TUDCA therapy on multiorgan insulin action and metabolic factors associated with insulin resistance in obese men and women. Twenty obese subjects ([means +/- SD] aged 48 +/- 11 years, BMI 37 +/- 4 kg/m2) were randomized to 4 weeks of treatment with TUDCA (1,750 mg/day) or placebo. A two-stage hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure in conjunction with stable isotopically labeled tracer infusions and muscle and adipose tissue biopsies were used to evaluate in vivo insulin sensitivity, cellular factors involved in insulin signaling, and cellular markers of ER stress. RESULTS Hepatic and muscle insulin sensitivity increased by approximately 30% (P &lt; 0.05) after treatment with TUDCA but did not change after placebo therapy. In addition, therapy with TUDCA, but not placebo, increased muscle insulin signaling (phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate(Tyr) and Akt(Ser473) levels) (P &lt; 0.05). Markers of ER stress in muscle or adipose tissue did not change after treatment with either TUDCA or placebo. These data demonstrate that TUDCA might be an effective pharmacological approach for treating insulin resistance. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the target cells and mechanisms responsible for this effect.",

    "title": "Oleic acid and adipokines synergize in inducing proliferation and inflammatory signalling in human vascular smooth muscle cells.",
    "abstract": "In the context of obesity, perivascular fat produces various adipokines and releases free fatty acids, which may induce inflammation and proliferation in the vascular wall. In this study we investigated how adipokines, oleic acid (OA) and the combined treatment regulate human vascular smooth muscle cell (hVSMC) proliferation and migration and the underlying signalling pathways. Adipocyte-conditioned media (CM) generated from human adipocytes induces a prominent proliferation and migration of hVSMC. Autocrine action of adiponectin totally abolishes CM-induced proliferation. Furthermore, OA but not palmitic acid induces proliferation of hVSMC. CM itself does not contain fatty acids, but CM in combination with OA markedly enhances proliferation of hVSMC in a synergistic way. Both the nuclear factor (NF)-&#x3ba;B and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway were synergistically activated under these conditions and found to be essential for hVSMC proliferation. Expression of iNOS and production of nitric oxide was only enhanced by combined treatment inducing a marked release of VEGF. Combination of OA and VEGF induces an additive increase of hVSMC proliferation. We could show that the combination of CM and OA led to a synergistic proliferation of hVSMC. Expression of iNOS and production of nitric oxide were only enhanced under these conditions and were paralleled by a marked release of VEGF. These results suggest that the combined elevated release of fatty acids and adipokines by adipose tissue in obesity might be critically related to hVSMC dysfunction, vascular inflammation and the development of atherosclerosis.",

    "abstract": "Hemopressin is a short, nine amino acid peptide (H-Pro-Val-Asn-Phe-Lys-Leu-Leu-Ser-His-OH) isolated from rat brain that behaves as an inverse agonist at the cannabinoid receptor CB(1), and is shown here to inhibit agonist-induced receptor internalization in a heterologous cell model. Since this peptide occurs naturally in the rodent brain, we determined its effect on appetite, an established central target of cannabinoid signaling. Hemopressin dose-dependently decreases night-time food intake in normal male rats and mice, as well as in obese ob/ob male mice, when administered centrally or systemically, without causing any obvious adverse side effects. The normal, behavioral satiety sequence is maintained in male mice fasted overnight, though refeeding is attenuated. The anorectic effect is absent in CB(1) receptor null mutant male mice, and hemopressin can block CB(1) agonist-induced hyperphagia in male rats, providing strong evidence for antagonism of the CB(1) receptor in vivo. We speculate that hemopressin may act as an endogenous functional antagonist at CB(1) receptors and modulate the activity of appetite pathways in the brain.",

    "abstract": "The YKL-40 coding chitinase 3-like 1 gene is 1 of the most overexpressed genes in human glioblastomas. The objectives of this study were to explore YKL-40 protein expression status and World Health Organization (WHO) pathologic grades of primary human astrocytoma and to investigate the role of YKL-40 in the proliferation of both established and primary astrocytoma cells in vitro. WHO grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 primary astrocytomas (210 patients) were evaluated for YKL-40 protein expression status in immunohistochemical analyses. In addition, after transfection with a plasmid that contained YKL-40 small-interfering RNA (siRNA), cell proliferation and the cell cycle were measured with a cell-viability assay and flow cytometry. Expression levels of phosphorylated, total mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase B (AKT) were detected by Western blot analysis. The percentage of positive cells and the staining intensity differed significantly between different pathologic tumor grades (P &lt; .001). The YKL-40 immunoreactivity score increased markedly with increased pathologic grade (F = 18.89; P &lt; .001). In the in vitro experiment, the cell cycle was arrested in G(1) phase. An inhibitor of the p38 MAPK, SB203580, could partially abrogate the cell proliferation inhibition effect by siRNA treatment. The expression levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and phosphorylated AKT were notably decreased in siRNA-transfected U87 cells. In contrast, the expression levels of phosphorylated p38 and phosphorylated c-jun N-terminal kinase 1 and 2 increased significantly (P &lt; .01). YKL-40 expression status correlated well with the pathologic grade of primary astrocytomas. The current results also indicted that YKL-40 plays a pivotal role in glioma cell proliferation through activation of the MAPK and AKT pathways. YKL-40 may be an attractive target for glioma therapy.",

    "abstract": "To design, manufacture and test a second generation leptin receptor (ObR) agonist glycopeptide derivative. The major drawback to current experimental therapies involving leptin protein is the appearance of treatment resistance. Our novel peptidomimetic was tested for efficacy and lack of resistance induction in rodent models of obesity and appetite reduction. The glycopeptide containing two additional non-proteinogenic amino acids was synthesized by standard solid-phase methods. Normal mice were fed with peanuts until their blood laboratory data and liver histology showed typical signs of obesity but not diabetes. The mice were treated with the peptidomimetic at 0.02, 0.1 or 0.5 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally side-by-side with 0.1 mg/kg/day leptin for 11 days. After termination of the assay, the blood cholesterol and glucose amounts were measured, the liver fat content was visualized and quantified and the remaining mice returned to normal diet and were allowed to mate. In parallel experiments normal rats were treated intranasally with the glycopeptide at 0.1 mg/kg/day for 10 days. The 12-residue glycosylated leptin-based peptidomimetic E1/6-amino-hexanoic acid (Aca) was designed to target a principal leptin/ObR-binding interface. E1/Aca induced leptin effects in ObR-positive cell lines at picomolar concentrations and readily crossed the blood-brain barrier (BBB) following intraperitoneal administration. The peptide initiated typical leptin-dependent signal transduction pathways both in the presence and absence of leptin protein. The peptide also reduced weight gain in mice fed with high-fat peanut diet in a dose-dependent manner. Obese mice receiving peptide E1/Aca at a 0.5 mg/kg/day dose lost weight, corresponding to a net 6.5% total body weight loss, while similar mice treated with leptin protein did not. Upon cessation of the weight loss treatment, several obesity-related pathologies (i.e. abnormal metabolic profile and liver histology as well as infertility) normalized in peptide-, but not leptin-treated, mice. Peptide E1/Aca added intranasally to growing normal rats decelerated normal weight gain corresponding to a net 6.8% net total body weight loss with statistical significance. No resistance induction to peptide E1/Aca or toxicity in either obese or healthy rodents was observed, indicating the potential for widespread utility of the peptidomimetic in the treatment of leptin-deficiency disorders. We provide additional proof for the hypothesis that difficulties in current leptin therapies reside at the BBB penetration stage, and we document that by either glycosylation or intranasal peptide administration we can overcome this limitation.",

In vivo, chitin is part of complex structures with other organic and inorganic compounds: in arthropods chitin is covalently linked to proteins and tanned by quinones, in fungi it is covalently linked to glucans, while in bacteria chitin is diversely combined according to Gram(+/-) classification. On the other hand, isolated, purified chitin is a plain polysaccharide that, at the nano level, presents itself as a highly associated structure, recently refined in terms of regularity, nature of bonds, crystallinity degree and unusual colloidal behavior. Chitins and modified chitins exert a number of beneficial actions, i.e., (i) they stimulate macrophages by interacting with receptors on the macrophage surface that mediate the internalization of chitin particles to be degraded by lysozyme and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (such as Nod-like, Toll-like, lectin, Dectin-1, leukotriene 134 and mannose receptors); (ii) the macrophages produce cytokines and other compounds that confer non-specific host resistance against bacterial and viral infections, and anti-tumor activity; (iii) chitin is a strong Th1 adjuvant that up-regulates Th1 immunity induced by heat-killed Mycobacterium bovis, while down- regulating Th2 immunity induced by mycobacterial protein; (iv) direct intranasal application of chitin microparticles into the lung was also able to significantly down-regulate allergic response to Dermatophagoids pteronyssinus and Aspergillus fumigatus in a murine model of allergy; (v) chitin microparticles had a beneficial effect in preventing and treating histopathologic changes in the airways of asthmatic mice; (vi) authors support the fact that chitin depresses the development of adaptive type 2 allergic responses. Since the expression of chitinases, chitrotriosidase and chitinase-like proteins is greatly amplified during many infections and diseases, the common feature of chitinase-like proteins and chitinase activity in all organisms appears to be the biochemical defense of the host. Unfortunately, conceptual and methodological errors are present in certain recent articles dealing with chitin and allergy, i.e., (1) omitted consideration of mammalian chitinase and/or chitotriosidase secretion, accompanied by inactive chitinase-like proteins, as an ancestral defensive means against invasion, capable to prevent the insurgence of allergy; (2) omitted consideration of the fact that the mammalian organism recognizes more promptly the secreted water soluble chitinase produced by a pathogen, rather than the insoluble and well protected chitin within the pathogen itself; (3) superficial and incomplete reports and investigations on chitin as an allergen, without mentioning the potent allergen from crustacean flesh, tropomyosine; (4) limited perception of the importance of the chemical/biochemical characteristics of the isolated chitin or chitosan for the replication of experiments and optimization of results; and (5) lack of interdisciplinarity. There is quite a large body of knowledge today on the use of chitosans as biomaterials, and more specifically as drug carriers for a variety of applications: the delivery routes being the same as those adopted for the immunological studies. Said articles, that devote attention to the safety and biocompatibility aspects, never reported intolerance or allergy in individuals and animals, even when the quantities of chitosan used in single experiments were quite large. Therefore, it is concluded that crab, shrimp, prawn and lobster chitins, as well as chitosans of all grades, once purified, should not be considered as crustacean derivatives, because the isolation procedures have removed proteins, fats and other contaminants to such an extent as to allow them to be classified as chemicals regardless of their origin.",

    "abstract": "The blood-brain barrier is the major obstacle that prevents diagnostic and therapeutic drugs being delivered to the central nervous systems in order to exert their effects. Specific ligand-receptor binding mediated endocytosis is one of the possible strategies to cross this barrier. A 30-amino-acid peptide (leptin30) derived from an endogenic hormone-leptin is exploited as brain-targeting ligand as it is reported to possess the same brain accumulation efficiency after intravenous injection. Dendrigraft poly-L-lysine (DGL) is used as non-viral gene vector in this study. DGL-PEG-Leptin30 was complexed with plasmid DNA yielding nanoparticles (NPs). The cellular uptake characteristic and mechanism were explored in brain capillary endothelial cells (BCECs) which express leptin receptors. Furthermore, brain parenchyma microglia cells such as BV-2 cells expressing leptin receptors could promote ligand-receptor mediated endocytosis leading to enhanced gene transfection ability of DGL-PEG-Leptin30/DNA NPs. The targeted NPs were proved to be transported across in vitro BBB model effectively and accumulate more in brains after i.v. resulting in a relatively high gene transfection efficiency both in vitro and in vivo. Besides, the NPs showed low cytotoxicity after in vitro transfection. Thus, DGL-PEG-Leptin30 provides a safe and noninvasive approach for the delivery of gene across the blood-brain barrier.",

    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, whose pathogenesis begins with the accumulation of liver fat and is followed by the development of necro-inflammation and fibrosis. Recent evidence indicates that adipocytokines, polypeptides secreted by the adispose tissue, might play an important role in the pathogeneic process and progression of NAFLD. In this review, we explore the role of leptin, and in part of other adipocytokines, in the interference with hepatic injury associated with fatty infiltration, in the modulation of steatosis and fibrosis, in both experimental models of the disease and in the clinical practice. We also discuss the potential use of leptin as non-invasive marker for differentiating simple fatty liver from NAFLD, and the possible novel therapeutic strategies aimed at interfering with the leptin axis to dampen chronic liver inflammation and NAFLD.",

    "title": "Anti-inflammatory effects of simvastatin on adipokines in type 2 diabetic patients with carotid atherosclerosis.",
    "abstract": "Statins are extensively used for lowering LDL-cholesterol and reducing cardiovascular events. Recent studies have shown that statins have beneficial anti-inflammatory effects. We aimed to determine whether and how adipokines are regulated during statin treatment in type 2 diabetic patients. In this study,we investigated the changes of CRP and inflammation-related adipokines (SAA,IL-6,TNFalpha and adiponectin) in 23 type 2 diabetic patients with atherosclerosis who received statin therapy, and 20 diabetic patients with atherosclerosis and 14 diabetic patients without atherosclerosis who did not receive statin therapy for a period of three months. By the end of the simvastatin treatment (40 mg, daily), LDL-cholesterol was decreased by 16.7% and HDL-cholesterol was increased by 31.9%. SAA, CRP, TNFalpha and IL-6 levels were decreased by 31.8%, 66.2%, 53.9% and 14%, respectively and adiponectin was increased by 59.6%, compared with the baseline levels. Interestingly, the decrease of SAA was positively correlated with that of LDL-cholesterol but negatively with HDL-cholesterol during statin treatment. Among the adipokines, the decrease of SAA was positively correlated with TNFalpha (r = 0.50, p = 0.016). The results suggest that adipokines may be differentially regulated and independent of cholesterol changes and that adipokines may be a mediator, and the adipose tissue may be a target of statins' anti-inflammatory effect.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown the ability of apelin to restore glucose tolerance in obese and insulin-resistant mice. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) from the omega-3 family that has many beneficial effects in obesity-linked disorders. The aim of this study was to examine in vitro the effects of EPA on apelin secretion and gene expression in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Treatment with EPA (100 and 200 microM) significantly increased basal (p&lt;0.01) and insulin-stimulated (p&lt;0.001) apelin secretion and gene expression in adipocytes. EPA also stimulated Akt phosphorylation, a down-stream target of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Moreover, treatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 completely blocked EPA-stimulatory action on apelin mRNA gene expression (p&lt;0.001), but not modified the stimulatory effect of EPA on basal apelin secretion. Furthermore, the stimulatory effect of EPA on basal apelin release was also observed in the presence of Actinomycin D and Cycloheximide, suggesting that EPA might also regulate apelin secretion by via post-transcriptional mechanisms. These findings suggest that the mechanisms mediating EPA-induced apelin synthesis and/or secretion are complex, involving steps that are PI3K dependent and steps that are PI3K independent.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is considered to be an important risk factor for postmenopausal breast cancer. Elevated estrogen levels are thought to be a growth factor associated with this relationship. However, there is increasing evidence that factors produced directly in adipose tissue, adipokines, can also affect breast cancer development. Leptin is one of the adipokines that is measured in serum/plasma in increasing amounts as body weight/body fat increases. We highlight important aspects of leptin in relationship to mammary/breast tumor development. This includes findings from human, in vitro and animal studies. Information on leptin-related compounds which may have therapeutic use is presented. Additionally strategies to alter serum leptin levels by dietary and pharmacological interventions are discussed. The reader will gain insights into the relationship of an adipose tissue protein and its potential role in breast cancer development as well as ways to intervene in leptin's actions. Continued research will determine if interfering with the action of leptin has preventive or therapeutic applications in breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Kisspeptin stimulates reproduction, and kisspeptin cells in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) express Ob-Rb in the mouse. Herein we report studies in ewes to determine whether kisspeptin cells express Ob-Rb and respond to leptin and whether reciprocal connections exist between kisspeptin cells and proopiomelanocortin (POMC) or neuropeptide Y (NPY) cells to modulate reproduction and metabolic function. Kiss1 mRNA was measured by in situ hybridization in ovariectomized ewes that were normal body weight, lean, or lean with leptin treatment by intracerebroventricular (icv) infusion (4 microg/h, 3 d). Kiss1 expression in the ARC and the preoptic area was lower in hypogonadotropic lean animals than animals of normal weight, and icv infusion of leptin partially restored Kiss1 expression in lean animals. Single-cell laser capture microdissection coupled with real-time PCR showed that Kiss1 cells in the preoptic area and ARC express Ob-Rb. Double-label fluorescent immunohistochemistry showed that reciprocal connections exist between kisspeptin cells and NPY and POMC cells. Accordingly, we treated ovariectomized ewes with kisspeptin (5 microg/h, icv) or vehicle for 20 h and examined POMC and NPY gene expression by in situ hybridization. Kisspeptin treatment reduced POMC and increased NPY gene expression. Thus, kisspeptin neurons respond to leptin and expression of Kiss1 mRNA is affected by leptin status. Kisspeptin cells communicate with NPY and POMC cells, altering expression of the relevant genes in the target cells; reciprocal connections also exist. This network between the three cell types could coordinate brain control of reproduction and metabolic homeostatic systems.",

    "title": "Obesity and inflammation--targets for OA therapy.",
    "abstract": "Obesity is one of the main risk factors for osteoarthritis (OA). For many years the association of obesity and OA has been simply attributed to the effects of overload on weight-bearing joints, and epidemiological surveys have shown a strict correlation between an increased body mass index and the severity of knee or hip OA, as well as some relief of pain and disability following weight loss. Instead, there is now a growing body of evidence that obesity is a complex syndrome in which an abnormal activation of neuroendocrine and pro-inflammatory pathways leads to an altered control of food intake, fat expansion and metabolic changes. Activated white adipose tissue increases the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1, IL-8, TNFalpha, IL-18, while regulatory cytokines, such as IL-10, are decreased. Adipocytes also produce peculiar cytokines, namely adipokines, that exert multiple effects, being capable of promoting synovial inflammation, cartilage degrading enzymes, and bone matrix remodeling. Furthermore, pro-inflammatory cytokines stimulate adipocytes to synthesize neuropeptides, such as substance P and nerve growth factor, that have been shown to be critical in regulating both the appetite and cartilage homeostasis. In this scenario, where the influence of obesity on OA stems from a complex interaction of genetic, metabolic, neuroendocrine, and biomechanical factors, there may be various different potential targets for OA therapy.",

    "title": "Detection of extracellular glucose by GLUT2 contributes to hypothalamic control of food intake.",
    "abstract": "The sugar transporter GLUT2, present in several tissues of the gut-brain axis, has been reported to be involved in the control of food intake. GLUT2 is a sugar transporter sustaining energy production in the cell, but it can also function as a receptor for extracellular glucose. A glucose-signaling pathway is indeed triggered, independently of glucose metabolism, through its large cytoplasmic loop domain. However, the contribution of the receptor function over the transporter function of GLUT2 in the control of food intake remains to be determined. Thus, we generated transgenic mice that express a GLUT2-loop domain, blocking the detection of glucose but leaving GLUT2-dependent glucose transport unaffected. Inhibiting GLUT2-mediated glucose detection augmented daily food intake by a mechanism that increased the meal size but not the number of meals. Peripheral hormones (ghrelin, insulin, leptin) were unaffected, leading to a focus on central aspects of feeding behavior. We found defects in c-Fos activation by glucose in the arcuate nucleus and changes in the amounts of TRH and orexin neuropeptide mRNA, which are relevant to poorly controlled meal size. Our data provide evidence that glucose detection by GLUT2 contributes to the control of food intake by the hypothalamus. The sugar transporter receptor, i.e., transceptor GLUT2, may constitute a drug target to treat eating disorders and associated metabolic diseases, particularly by modulating its receptor function without affecting vital sugar provision by its transporter function.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate whether insulin intervention could affect the metabolic and endocrine functions of adipose tissue. C57BL/6 mice were fed on a high-fat-diet for 12-16 weeks to induce insulin resistance. Insulin intervention was administered in the high-fat-diet mice for 4 weeks at 12 weeks (early insulin treatment) or 16 weeks (late insulin treatment). Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests were performed before and after insulin treatment. Expression levels of factors involved in the triglyceride synthesis and endocrine functions of adipose tissue including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK-C), fatty acid synthase (FAS), aquaporin 7 (AQP7), adiponectin, visfatin, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were determined by Western blot. In the obese mice, glucose tolerance was impaired; triglyceride content was increased in the liver tissue; protein expression of FAS and adiponectin was decreased; expression of visfatin was increased in adipose tissue. After 4-week insulin treatment, glucose tolerance was improved; triglyceride content was decreased in the liver and skeletal muscle; expression of PEPCK-C, FAS, and adiponectin was increased in the adipose tissue; IL-6 and AQP7 expression was reduced in the fat. Early insulin treatment had better effect in increasing the expression of FAS and PEPCK-C and decreasing the expression of IL-6. These results indicate that insulin can target adipocytes for improvement of insulin sensitivity through stimulating triglyceride synthesis and partly improving endocrine functions.",

However, the role for leucine in the regulation of leptin receptor expression in muscle has not been investigated. The present study was conducted to test the hypothesis that leucine regulates leptin receptor levels in C2C12 myotubes. Cells were cultured in the presence of DMEM/F12 medium containing supplemental 0 or 5 mM L: -leucine. Leptin receptor expression by C2C12 myotubes peaked at 2 h post-supplementation. Additionally, leucine stimulated leptin receptor expression at both mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, leucine enhanced the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Addition of rapamycin (an inhibitor of mTOR) to culture medium completely suppressed leucine-induced activation of mTOR and inhibited leucine-stimulated leptin receptor production. These results indicate that leucine affects leptin receptor expression in muscle cells via the mTOR signaling pathway.",

Considering the importance of insulin in ovarian physiology, in this study, using prenatal T- and dihydrotestosterone (DHT, a nonaromatizable androgen)-treated female sheep, we tested the hypothesis that prenatal androgen excess alters the intraovarian insulin signaling cascade and metabolic mediators that have an impact on insulin signaling. Changes in ovarian insulin receptor (INSRB), insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PIK3), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARG), and adiponectin proteins were determined at fetal (Days 90 and 140), postpubertal (10 mo), and adult (21 mo) ages by immunohistochemistry. Results indicated that these proteins were expressed in granulosa, theca, and stromal compartments, with INSRB, IRS1, PPARG, and adiponectin increasing in parallel with advanced follicular differentiation. Importantly, prenatal T excess induced age-specific changes in PPARG and adiponectin expression, with increased PPARG expression evident during fetal life and decreased antral follicular adiponectin expression during adult life. Comparison of developmental changes in prenatal T and DHT-treated females found that the effects on PPARG were programmed by androgenic actions of T, whereas the effects on adiponectin were likely by its estrogenic action. These results suggest a role for PPARG in the programming of ovarian disruptions by prenatal T excess, including a decrease in antral follicular adiponectin expression and a contributory role for adiponectin in follicular persistence and ovulatory failure.",

    "title": "Visfatin: a potential therapeutic target for rheumatoid arthritis.",
    "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is usually a chronic, systemic inflammatory disorder primarily targeting the synovium and articular cartilage. It is incurable, costly and responds poorly to treatment. Methotrexate alone or in combination with conventional and/or biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is often used to induce remission of active disease. The effectiveness of treatment is, however, limited and most patients develop chronic disability and require total knee arthroplasty or total hip replacement. Emerging therapies targeting specific cytokines and growth factors in the RA inflammatory cascade offer potent new means of modifying disease activity. Recently, increased concentrations of adipokines, including visfatin, mainly produced by adipocytes in serum and joint synovial fluid, were found in RA patients. Visfatin has important pro-inflammatory and catabolic roles in RA pathogenesis and is now being studied as a potential therapeutic target for RA. Here we discuss the relationship between visfatin and RA and its potential as a therapeutic target for RA.",

    "abstract": "Nobiletin is a polymethoxylated flavone found in certain citrus fruits that exhibits various pharmacological effects including anti-inflammatory, antitumor and neuroprotective properties. The present study investigated the effects of nobiletin on insulin sensitivity in obese diabetic ob/ob mice, and the possible mechanisms involved. The ob/ob mice were treated with nobiletin (200mg/kg) for 5 weeks. Nobiletin significantly improved the plasma glucose levels, homeostasis model assessment index, glucose tolerance in an oral glucose tolerance test and plasma adiponectin levels. In white adipose tissue (WAT), nobiletin significantly decreased the mRNA expression levels of inflammatory adipokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and increased the mRNA expression levels of adiponectin, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma and its target genes. At the same time, nobiletin increased the glucose transporter (Glut) 4 expression levels in the whole plasma membrane, and Glut1 and phospho-Akt expression in the whole cell lysates in WAT and muscle. Nobiletin also increased Glut4 protein expression level in the whole cell lysates of the muscle. Taken together, the present results suggest that nobiletin improved the hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in obese diabetic ob/ob mice by regulating expression of Glut1 and Glut4 in WAT and muscle, and expression of adipokines in WAT.",

    "abstract": "The aim of our study was to examine the efficacy of short-term intravenous insulin intervention followed by oral pioglitazone/metformin therapy to prevent patients from continuous insulin application. This prospective, open-label, 4-month pilot study comprised of 14 diabetes patients (5 female, 9 male; age 60 +/- 2 years; body mass index 29 +/- 3.2 kg/m(2); hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] 7.6 +/- 1.1%) with (1) insufficient glycemic control under a dose of metformin &gt;or=1700 mg/day and/or metformin plus additional oral antidiabetes drugs (OADs) and (2) appropriate residual beta-cell function. Initially, an inpatient 34 h continuous intravenous insulin infusion was performed, and metformin was given (2x 850 mg/day). Insulin was stopped, and pioglitazone 30 mg/day was added at the second inpatient day. Patients were followed for four months. Efficacy parameters [change of HbA1c, fasting blood glucose [FBG], intact proinsulin, adiponectin, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP)] were assessed after initial normalization of blood glucose values by intravenous insulin and at the study end point. During the acute insulin intervention, FBG levels were stabilized in all study subjects. In the following OAD treatment period, five patients showed an improvement of HbA1c &gt; 0.5% [35.7%; seven patients remained stable (50.0%), two patients were nonresponders (14.3%)]. Fasting glucose values dropped after insulin infusion (-17.7%; p &lt; .001). This effect was maintained during the consecutive OAD treatment period (glucose +0.3%, not significant (NS); HbA1c -6.0%; p &lt; .05). The initial decrease in fasting intact proinsulin levels was also maintained during the study (end value -41%, p &lt; .05). Improvements in hsCRP values (postinsulin value, -15%, NS; end value -37%; p &lt; .05) and adiponectin values (postinsulin value +15%, NS; end value +128%; p &lt; .001) were demonstrated at end point only after continued glitazone intake. Our pilot study demonstrated that a beneficial effect of a short-term intravenous insulin application on glycemic control was effectively maintained by pioglitazone/metformin treatment for at least 4 months. In addition, the oral therapy significantly improved cardiovascular risk parameters.",

    "abstract": "Hypoxia is a strong modulator of angiogenesis, accelerating adipose tissue expansion, suggesting that hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) can be a novel target for anti-obesity. We conjugated antisense-HIF1alpha-oligonucleotide (ASO) with low molecular weight protamine (LMWP), a cell-penetrating peptide, to enhance its ability to block hypoxic-angiogenesis, thereby eliciting an anti-obesity effect. Nano-sized ASO-LMWP (AS-L) conjugates enhanced cellular uptake of ASO without yielding a cytotoxic effect and protected the ASO against enzymatic attack and chemical reduction. AS-L showed enhanced intra-cellular localization compared to naked ASO and the complex of ASO with lipofectamine during hypoxic-differentiation. Consequently AS-L induced significant down-regulation of leptin and VEGF gene expressions, thereby reducing fat accumulation in the cell. This proof-of-concept study shows that AS-L produces an inhibitory effect on adipogenesis and angiogenesis during differentiation, indicating LMWP mediated ASO delivery can potentially be a safe and promising treatment for obesity.",

    "abstract": "Currently used antiobesity remedies offer only a modest weight reduction, and have untoward effects that can complicate treatment efforts. Motivated by the needs of the pharmacotherapy of obesity, the study explored the role of neuropeptide Y, leptin, and corticotrophin-releasing hormone. The study used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis which is a tool for automated discovery and visualization of molecular interactions. In ingestion-controlling networks, neuropeptide Y, leptin, and corticotrophin-releasing hormone molecules are commonly combined into the units designated as 'maximal motifs'. The analysis of this triad allowed suggesting that maximal motifs are not more than a compendium of admission rules and transmission alternatives of their nodes catalogued in the dataset. Nonetheless, these options seem to endow them with the flexibility needed to respond dynamically as a functional unit to changing internal (metabolic) conditions or environmental challenges. Thus far, each peptide represents a separate target for pharmaceutical interventions (as judged by US patents scanned). The study concludes with predictions regarding designs of 'multitargeted' antiobesity agents since only by hitting a combination of targets can an appropriate therapeutic effect be achieved.",

    "title": "The immunosuppressant drug, thalidomide, improves hepatic alterations induced by a high-fat diet in mice.",
    "abstract": "Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, are known to be involved in the establishment of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance plays a key role in the development of obesity-related pathologies, such as type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The state of chronic inflammation associated with obesity led us to hypothesize that TNF-alpha blockade may have an effect on experimentally obese animals. We studied the effects of thalidomide, an immunosuppressant and anti-TNF-alpha drug, on hepatic alterations that were induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) in mice. Obesity was induced in Swiss mice using a HFD for 12 weeks. Thalidomide-treated animals received thalidomide i.p. (100 mg/kg/day, 10 days). Glucose, aspartate aminotransferases and alanine aminotransferases levels were assessed in the blood. Insulin and glucose tolerance tests were performed. The liver was excised for histological, triglyceride, gene and protein expression analyses. We found improvements in both the basal glucose blood levels and the response to insulin administration in the treated animals. The molecular analysis of insulin signalling revealed a restoration of the hepatic insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and AKT phosphorylation. The hepatic expression of TNF-alpha was inhibited and the levels correlated with a significant reduction in the steatosis area. Other hepatic inflammatory markers, such as iNOS and suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS-3), were also reduced. We suggest that immunosuppressant drugs that target TNF-alpha and that may also contribute to reductions in the inflammatory markers that are associated with obesity could be a therapeutic option in NAFLD and type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Adipocyte dysfunction is strongly associated with the development of insulin resistance and diabetes, and regulation of adipogenesis is important in prevention of diabetes. We prepared a 100% methanol fraction of methanolic extract from unripe kiwi fruit (Actinidia deliciosa), designated KMF (kiwi fruit methanol fraction). When applied to 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells, KMF promoted adipocyte differentiation, increased glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activity, and increased triglyceride (TG) content. KMF markedly increased mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)-the master adipogenic transcription factor-and its target genes. Moreover, KMF increased mRNA expression and protein secretion of adiponectin, whereas mRNA expression and secretion of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were decreased. Compared with troglitazone, KMF decreased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB) activation. Glucose uptake was stimulated by KMF in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Taken together, these results indicate that KMF may exert beneficial effects against diabetes via its ability to regulate adipocyte differentiation and function.",

    "abstract": "TOR (target of rapamycin) is a serine-threonine protein kinase that is conserved across a diverse range of species from fungi to mammals. The signaling pathway that is anchored by TOR is also conserved across species. In mammals, mTOR integrates growth factor, amino acid, nutrient and energy sensing signals, and thus plays a major role in cell growth and proliferation, protein synthesis and autophagy. As a result of the pivotal role of mTOR in signaling, the aberrant regulation of mTOR has been implicated in several disease processes, including cancer, diabetes, ocular diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, as well as in lifespan extension. More recently, rapamycin (sirolimus) analogs that antagonize the mTOR signaling pathway have been approved for the treatment of several cancers. This review describes some recent advances in the understanding of mTOR signaling, with an emphasis on the functional consequences of mTOR inhibition and therapeutic intervention strategies.",

    "title": "Metabolic regulation of ghrelin O-acyl transferase (GOAT) expression in the mouse hypothalamus, pituitary, and stomach.",
    "abstract": "Ghrelin acts as an endocrine link connecting physiological processes regulating food intake, body composition, growth, and energy balance. Ghrelin is the only peptide known to undergo octanoylation. The enzyme mediating this process, ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT), is expressed in the gastrointestinal tract (GI; primary source of circulating ghrelin) as well as other tissues. The present study demonstrates that stomach GOAT mRNA levels correlate with circulating acylated-ghrelin levels in fasted and diet-induced obese mice. In addition, GOAT was found to be expressed in both the pituitary and hypothalamus (two target tissues of ghrelin's actions), and regulated in response to metabolic status. Using primary pituitary cell cultures as a model system to study the regulation of GOAT expression, we found that acylated-ghrelin, but not desacyl-ghrelin, increased GOAT expression. In addition, growth-hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and leptin increased, while somatostatin (SST) decreased GOAT expression. The physiologic relevance of these later results is supported by the observation that pituitary GOAT expression in mice lacking GHRH, SST and leptin showed opposite changes to those observed after in vitro treatment with the corresponding peptides. Therefore, it seems plausible that these hormones directly contribute to the regulation of pituitary GOAT. Interestingly, in all the models studied, pituitary GOAT expression paralleled changes in the expression of a dominant spliced-variant of ghrelin (In2-ghrelin) and therefore this transcript may be a primary substrate for pituitary GOAT. Collectively, these observations support the notion that the GI tract is not the only source of acylated-ghrelin, but in fact locally produced des-acylated-ghrelin could be converted to acylated-ghrelin within target tissues by locally active GOAT, to mediate its tissue-specific effects.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is characterized by an increase of adipose tissue as a result of a positive imbalance between food intake and energy expenditure. Recent studies have indicated that adipocyte function is more complex than expected, since these cells have multiple functions and are integrated in a homeostatic network to optimize energy resources. As metabolic sensors in the body, adipocytes and the surrounding stromal vascular cells produce and secrete autocrine, paracrine and endocrine factors, able to regulate aspects involved in the development of adipocytes, as well as effects in peripheral organs important for metabolism. Regulation of these endocrine factors could lead to new therapeutic approaches targeted at aspects related to adipogenesis, preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation, inflammatory cytokine release and secretion, adipose tissue vascularization, and regulation of lipid metabolism or, alternatively, regulation of energy dissipation in mitochondria. In the study of the mechanisms of adipogenesis and remodulation of adipose tissue with respect to adipocyte size and function, an alternative and unorthodox strategy to improve obesity-associated metabolic complications could consist of increasing the storage capacity of adipose tissue to prevent a toxic response known as lipotoxicity.",

    "title": "Alleviation of high-fat diet-induced fatty liver damage in group IVA phospholipase A2-knockout mice.",
    "abstract": "Hepatic fat deposition with hepatocellular damage, a feature of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, is mediated by several putative factors including prostaglandins. In the present study, we examined whether group IVA phospholipase A(2) (IVA-PLA(2)), which catalyzes the first step in prostanoid biosynthesis, is involved in the development of fatty liver, using IVA-PLA(2)-knockout mice. Male wild-type mice on high-fat diets (20% fat and 1.25% cholesterol) developed hepatocellular vacuolation and liver hypertrophy with an increase in the serum levels of liver damage marker aminotransferases when compared with wild-type mice fed normal diets. These high-fat diet-induced alterations were markedly decreased in IVA-PLA(2)-knockout mice. Hepatic triacylglycerol content was lower in IVA-PLA(2)-knockout mice than in wild-type mice under normal dietary conditions. Although high-fat diets increased hepatic triacylglycerol content in both genotypes, the degree was lower in IVA-PLA(2)-knockout mice than in wild-type mice. Under the high-fat dietary conditions, IVA-PLA(2)-knockout mice had lower epididymal fat pad weight and smaller adipocytes than wild-type mice. The serum level of prostaglandin E(2), which has a fat storage effect, was lower in IVA-PLA(2)-knockout mice than in wild-type mice, irrespective of the kind of diet. In both genotypes, high-fat diets increased serum leptin levels equally between the two groups, but did not affect the serum levels of adiponectin, resistin, free fatty acid, triacylglycerol, glucose, or insulin. Our findings suggest that a deficiency of IVA-PLA(2) alleviates fatty liver damage caused by high-fat diets, probably because of the lower generation of IVA-PLA(2) metabolites, such as prostaglandin E(2). IVA-PLA(2) could be a promising therapeutic target for obesity-related diseases including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.",

    "title": "Leptin stimulates the migration of colon carcinoma cells by multiple signaling pathways.",
    "abstract": "Active migration of tumor cells is a prerequisite for the development of metastasis and tumor progression, and is regulated by a variety of extracellular ligands. Epidemiological studies have shown that obesity increases the risk of colon cancer by 1.5- to 2-fold with obesity-associated colon cancer accounting for 14-35% of total incidence. In obese individuals, serum levels of leptin are markedly increased, and therefore, we have investigated the impact of this adipocytokine on the migration of various human colon carcinoma cell lines such as SW480, SW620, and HCT116. Leptin significantly enhanced the migratory activity of all three cell lines, and the strongest effect was observed in SW480 cells, which increased their locomotor activity from 28% spontaneously locomoting cells to 50%. The intracellular signal transduction regulating this pro-migratory effect involves the activation of the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 via Janus kinases, but also the activity of src tyrosine kinases, focal adhesion kinase, exclusively protein kinase Cdelta, and the phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase, as proven by the use of particular inhibitors and target-specific small interfering RNAs. Herein, we deliver new evidence for a modulatory role of leptin in the regulation of colon cancer progression by stimulating tumor cell migration. Thus, our findings have potential clinical implications, because understanding the impact of leptin on tumor cell migration and the underlying signal transduction mechanisms is mandatory for future development of novel therapeutics to treat obesity-associated colorectal cancer.",

    "title": "Adiponectin inhibits allograft rejection in murine cardiac transplantation.",
    "abstract": "Low levels of plasma adiponectin, an adipocytokine that possesses anti-inflammatory and antiatherogenic properties, frequently observed among obese subjects correlate with higher prevalence of several cardiovascular diseases. This study investigated whether adiponectin modulates allograft rejection in major histocompatibility complex class II-mismatched cardiac transplants. We heterotopically transplanted Bm12 allografts into adiponectin-deficient (APN-/-, C57BL/6 background) or wild-type (APN+/+) mice. Some APN-/- mice received adiponectin reconstitution by adenovirus. Histologic analyses assessed allograft rejection, and real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction evaluated the genes for cytokines/chemokines associated with the immune and inflammatory responses. In addition, we tested the effect of adiponectin on proliferation and cytokine/chemokine production in mouse T lymphocytes stimulated in vitro with anti-CD3 antibodies. Allografts transplanted to APN-/- mice showed severe acute rejection relative to transplants in APN+/+ hosts accompanied by increased accumulation of CD4- and CD8-positive T lymphocytes and Mac3-positive macrophages. Adiponectin provision by adenovirus in APN-/- mice reversed these exacerbated responses to allografting. The rejected allografts in APN-/- mice contained significantly higher levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, and regulated on activation normal t expressed and presumably secreted. Moreover, adiponectin significantly suppressed proliferation and production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, regulated on activation normal t expressed and presumably secreted, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and interferon-gamma inducible protein-10 in mouse T lymphocytes stimulated in vitro with anti-CD3 antibodies. These observations provide new mechanistic insight into immunoregulation in allograft recipients relative to obesity, an increasingly prevalent risk factor. Adiponectin may offer a new therapeutic target for allograft rejection after cardiac transplantation.",

    "abstract": "Leptin restores gonadotropic function in lean hypogonadotropic animals by an unknown mechanism. We aimed to test the hypothesis that restoration of gonadotropic function is a result of an upregulation of central acetylated melanocortin production. Lean ovariectomised (OVX) ewes received intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusions of leptin (or vehicle) for 3 days, which upregulated proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA and restored pulsatile luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion. A melanocortin agonist (MTII), but not naloxone treatment, reinstated pulsatile LH secretion in lean OVX ewes. We treated (i.c.v.) lean OVX ewes with leptin (or vehicle) and measured peptide levels and post-translational modification in the arcuate nucleus (ARC). Levels of beta-endorphin (beta-END) were lower in lean animals, with no effect of leptin treatment. Desacetyl-alpha-MSH was the predominant form of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) in the ARC and levels were similar in all groups. In another group of lean and normal-weight OVX ewes, we measured the different forms of alpha-MSH in ARC, hypothalamus (ARC-removed) and the preoptic area (POA). Acetylated alpha-MSH levels were lower in lean animals in the terminal beds of the hypothalamus and POA but not the ARC. Leptin corrects the hypogonadotropic state in the lean condition by upregulation of POMC gene expression, and may increase transport and acetylation of melanocortins to target cells in the brain. Melanocortin treatment restores LH secretion in lean animals.",

    "abstract": "The peripubertal period is critical for the final maturation of circuits controlling energy homeostasis and stress response. However, the consequence of juvenile fat consumption on adult physiology is not clear. This study analyzed the adult consequences of post-weaning fat feeding on limbic-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis components and on metabolic regulators of female rats. Wistar rats were fed either a high fat (HF) diet or the normal chow from weaning to puberty or to 3 months of age. Additional groups crossed their diets at puberty onset. Plasma leptin, insulin, and corticosterone levels were determined by radioimmunoassay and their brain receptors by western blot analysis. Adult HF-fed animals though not overweight, had higher corticosterone and reduced glucocorticoid receptor levels in the hypothalamus and hippocampus, compared to the controls. The alterations in HPA axis emerged already at puberty onset. Leptin receptor levels in the hypothalamus were reduced only by continuous fat feeding from weaning to adulthood. The pre-pubertal period appeared more vulnerable to diet-induced alterations in adulthood than the post-pubertal one. Switching from fat diet to normal chow at puberty onset restored most of the diet-induced alterations in the HPA axis. The corticosteroid circuit rather than the leptin or insulin system appears as the principal target for the peripubertal fat diet-induced effects in adult female rats.",

    "title": "Adiponectin inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced adventitial fibroblast migration and transition to myofibroblasts via AdipoR1-AMPK-iNOS pathway.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin is an important antiatherogenic adipocytokine that inhibits inflammation, insulin resistance, and oxide stress. Inflammation in the vascular adventitia is a crucial factor in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Adventitial fibroblasts (AFs) can proliferate, divide into myofibroblasts, and migrate to the intima to become a new component of atherosclerotic plaque under inflammation and atherosclerosis. We investigated whether adiponectin might prevent AFs from proliferating, migrating, and transforming into myofibroblasts. Cultured AFs were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the presence or absence of adiponectin. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay and migration and scratch-wound assays demonstrated that adiponectin reduced the AF proliferation and migration induced by LPS, respectively, whereas treatment with AdipoR1 small interfering (si) RNA (siAdipoR1), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) siRNA (siAMPK), and an AMPK inhibitor reversed the effect. Immunocytochemistry and Western blot revealed that adiponectin reduced the transition of AFs to myofibroblasts, and treatment with siAdipoR1, siAMPK, and the AMPK inhibitor increased the transition. RT-PCR, Western blotting, and nitric oxide (NO) assay showed that adiponectin reduces induced NO synthase (iNOS) and nitrotyrosine expression and NO and ONOO(-) production induced by LPS. Treatment with siAdipoR1, siAMPK, and the AMPK inhibitor significantly attenuated adiponectin-induced phosphorylation of AMPK and its downstream target acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase and up-regulated iNOS mRNA and protein expression, which resulted in a marked increase of NO and ONOO(-) production. In apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, immunohistochemistry of treated vascular adventitia showed that both iNOS expression and ONOO(-) production could be reversed with an adenovirus-adiponectin vector. Taken together, these results suggest that adiponectin reduces LPS-induced NO production and nitrosative stress and prevents AFs from proliferating, transforming to myoflbroblasts, and migrating to the intima, thus worsening atherosclerosis, by inhibiting the AdipoR1-AMPK-iNOS pathway in AFs.",

This study investigated the role of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in gAd-induced ROS and NO generation. gAd stimulation induced phosphorylation of mTOR, which peaked at 20 min and dissolved rapidly. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity with wortmannin suppressed gAd-induced phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR. Administration of rapamycin partially reduced gAd-induced generation of intracellular and mitochondrial ROS, but not release of NO. To further confirm the role of mTOR in gAd stimulation, the effect of the activators of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) on gAd-induced mTOR phosphorylation was examined. Pre-treatment with three kinds of AMPK activators, AICAR, 2-deoxy-D-glucose and A-769662, suppressed gAd-induced mTOR phosphorylation. Furthermore, these AMPK activators significantly reduced gAd-evoked intracellular and mitochondrial ROS generation and NO release.",

    "abstract": "Rats with diet-induced obesity (DIO) usually experience hyperleptinemia. Thus, leptin produced by adipocytes does not deplete adipocyte fat, which implying a leptin resistance in adipocytes during overnutrition. Here, we induced hyperleptinemia in rats by feeding them a diet consisting of 45% fat. In epididymal adipose tissues, the mRNA and protein levels of a putative leptin resistant factor, suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS-3), were increased. The mRNA levels of SOCS-3 in adipocytes differentiated from adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) were higher in DIO rats than in rats on a 10% fat diet. Using SOCS-3 short hairpin RNA lentivirus interference, we found decreased expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase mRNA (a marker of de novo lipogenesis) and increased expression of acetyl-CoA oxidase mRNA (a marker of fat oxidation) in SOCS-3-knockdown adipocytes after incubation with 50&#xa0;nM leptin for 6&#xa0;h. We conclude that the SOCS-3 knockdown may have increased the leptin-mediated in situ fatty acid oxidation in the DIO adipocytes, and therefore, SOCS-3 might be an excellent target for therapeutic intervention for obesity.",

    "title": "Impact of simvastatin on adipose tissue: pleiotropic effects in vivo.",
    "abstract": "Statins belong to a class of drugs well known for their ability to reduce circulating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In addition to cholesterol lowering, they also exhibit potential antiinflammatory and antioxidant properties, suggesting that tissues other than liver may be targeted by statins to exert their beneficial metabolic effects. Adipocytes have received very little attention as a potential target of these drugs, possibly because adipocytes are not a major source of biosynthetic cholesterol. Here, we examine the effects of simvastatin on the secretory pathway, inflammation, and cellular metabolism of adipocytes as well as on whole-body insulin sensitivity. We find that statins have a selective effect on the secretion of the insulin-sensitizing adipokine adiponectin by reducing circulating levels of the high-molecular-weight form of adiponectin specifically with a concomitant increase in intracellular adiponectin levels. However, these effects on adiponectin do not translate into changes in metabolism or whole-body insulin sensitivity, potentially due to additional antiinflammatory properties of statins. In addition, ob/ob mice treated with statins have reduced adiposity and an altered ultrastructure of the plasma membrane with respect to caveolar histology. Our data demonstrate that statins have major effects on the cellular physiology of the adipocyte on multiple levels.",

    "abstract": "Studies have shown that obesity increases cardiometabolic risk across the span of life. Obesity results in increased production of proinflammatory adipokines and decreased production of the anti-inflammatory adipokine, adiponectin, which eventually leads to atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Lifestyle changes are the cornerstone for treatment of overweight and obese patients; however, pharmacotherapy and surgery are 2 additional treatment options that may be considered when lifestyle changes alone are unsuccessful. Adipose tissue, particularly central adipose tissue, is an endocrine organ, the actions of which tie together all components of cardiometabolic risk. Weight loss reduces levels of most proinflammatory adipokines, attenuates inflammation, improves endothelial function, and enhances insulin sensitivity. In view of these effects, obesity represents an obvious target for pharmacologic intervention. However, the benefits associated with the pharmacologic management of weight loss must be weighed against the potential for drug-related adverse events.",

    "abstract": "Adipose tissue can affect human physiology through its secreted products, collectively termed adipokines, which mediate complex crosstalk between organs. Adipokines have been linked to a wide range of pathologies in many tissues; however, the pathophysiological significance of these cytokines remains poorly understood, and more research is needed in this area. Adipokines may have both beneficial and potentially harmful effects; for example, leptin reduces body weight, but also impairs immune responses. A cautious approach is therefore warranted when considering the pharmacological manipulation of adipokines to treat diseases, and novel approaches may be required to target specific organs or actions to reduce the potential for adverse effects.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the effects of dietary conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) on white adipose tissue (WAT) in heavy pigs. Twelve pigs were assigned to 1 of 2 groups supplemented with either 0 or 0.75% of a CLA preparation (isomeric mixture) and were slaughtered at 159 +/- 2.3 kg live weight. Their subcutaneous WAT was analyzed by both chemical and microanatomical methods. The WAT of CLA-fed pigs tended to have a higher protein content (P = 0.064) and smaller adipocytes (P = 0.053) than that of control (CTR) pigs. The number of proliferating preadipocytes tended to be greater (P = 0.076) in pigs fed CLA, whereas the number of apoptotic adipocytes was greater (P &lt; 0.01) than in CTR pig. Immunohistochemistry revealed that leptin (Ob) expression was lower (P = 0.048) in adipocytes from treated pigs and Western blot quantification of Ob revealed lower levels (P &lt; 0.05) in CLA-fed pigs. The Ob receptor was not affected by dietary CLA supplementation. Tyrosine hydroxylase activity was higher (P &lt; 0.001) in WAT of CLA fed-pigs than in CTR. It is conceivable that the increased noradrenergic activity due to dietary CLA decreases the Ob expression, although it does not diminish the lipid content of WAT, at least in heavy pigs. This article describes the interaction between CLA and Ob in the WAT of heavy pigs and we hypothesize that there is an increased noradrenergic stimulation of lipolysis directly in the target tissue.",

Since blood levels of ADN are low in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), this study was designed to investigate the therapeutic effectiveness of increasing the ADN level through injection of plasmid DNA encoding ADN in type 2 DM. A non-obese type 2 DM mouse model was established via combined administration of streptozotocin with nicotinamide and exhibited significantly higher plasma glucose concentration and insulin resistance compared with normal controls according to oral glucose tolerance and insulin challenge tests. Plasmid DNA encoding mouse ADN from differentiated NIH3T3 adipocytes was constructed in pVAX1 (pVAX/ADN). Transfection of pVAX/ADN into various cell lines including HeLa, HT22, HEK293, HepG2, and SK-Hep1 cells, increased ADN mRNA expression levels in a dose-dependent manner. The administration of pVAX/ADN into non-obese type 2 DM mice via tail vein significantly increased the blood level of ADN and decreased the plasma glucose concentration. Moreover, the parameters related to insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and insulin sensitivity (QUICKI) were significantly improved. These results suggest that ADN gene therapy could be a clinically effective tool for the treatment of type 2 DM.",

    "abstract": "Obesity causes hypertension and sympathoactivation, a process proposed to be mediated by leptin. Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a major new pharmaceutical target in the treatment of obesity and type II diabetes mellitus, constrains the metabolic actions of leptin, but the extent to which PTP1B regulates its cardiovascular effects is unclear. This study examined the hypothesis that PTP1B is a negative regulator of the cardiovascular effects of leptin. PTP1B knockout mice had lower body fat but higher mean arterial pressure (116+/-5 versus 105+/-5 mm Hg, P&lt;0.05) than controls. Leptin infusion produced a greater anorexic effect in PTP1B knockout mice and a marked increase in mean arterial pressure (135+/-5 mm Hg) in PTP1B knockout mice only. The decrease in mean arterial pressure in response to ganglionic blockade was higher in PTP1B knockout mice (-38+/-3% versus -29+/-3%, P&lt;0.05), which suggests increased sympathetic tone. PTP1B deletion blunted mean arterial pressure responses to phenylephrine injection (55+/-10% versus 93+/-7%, P&lt;0.05). Phenylephrine-induced aortic contraction was reduced in PTP1B knockout mice (57.7+/-9% versus 96.3+/-12% of KCl, P&lt;0.05), consistent with desensitization to chronically elevated sympathetic tone. Furthermore, PTP1B deletion significantly reduced gene expression of 3 alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor subtypes, consistent with blunted constriction to phenylephrine. These data indicate that PTP1B is a key regulator of the cardiovascular effects of leptin and that reduced vascular adrenergic reactivity provides a compensatory limit to the effects of leptin on mean arterial pressure.",

Glucose uptake was measured upon gAd and fAd treatment after incubation with different doses (0.3, 0.6, 3, 6, 60 nmol/l) of leptin for 6, 12 and 24 h. We also measured adiponectin receptor (ADIPOR) expression and stimulation of downstream signalling by gAd and fAd using co-immunoprecipitation and western blotting following leptin pretreatment, as well as analysis of fatty acid uptake and oxidation using radiolabelled tracers. Leptin attenuated the stimulation of glucose uptake by gAd and fAd in a dose- and time-dependent manner, a finding correlated with decreased levels of ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2. gAd and fAd increased palmitate uptake via activation of AMP protein kinase (T172), enhanced expression of the fatty acid transporter CD36, phosphorylated acetyl-CoA carboxylase (S79) and enhanced palmitate oxidation, all of which were attenuated by leptin pretreatment. Adiponectin can also enhance insulin sensitivity via direct signalling crosstalk; here we show that enhanced insulin-stimulated IRS-1 (Y612) and Akt (T308) phosphorylation in response to fAd was attenuated by leptin. APPL1 was recently identified as a critical mediator of adiponectin action in skeletal muscle. We demonstrated that leptin attenuated binding of APPL1 to LKB1, a downstream target leading to AMPK phosphorylation. The direct metabolic and insulin-sensitising effects of adiponectin were attenuated in the presence of leptin.",

    "abstract": "The 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric, evolutionary conserved enzyme which has emerged as a critical regulator of skeletal muscle cellular bioenergetics. AMPK is activated by both chemical (adipokines) and mechanical (stretch, contraction) stimuli leading to metabolic changes within muscle cells that include increased fatty acid oxidation, glucose uptake and glycolysis, as well as the stimulation and regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. Collectively these acute responses and chronic adaptations act to reduce cellular disturbances, resulting in tighter metabolic control and maintenance of energy homeostasis. This brief review will describe the structure, function and activation of AMPK in skeletal muscle and how this ubiquitous molecule may be a plausible target for the treatment of several lifestyle-related metabolic disorders.",

    "title": "High fat diet-induced obesity modifies the methylation pattern of leptin promoter in rats.",
    "abstract": "Leptin is an adipokine involved in body weight and food intake regulation whose promoter region presents CpG islands that could be subject to dynamic methylation. This methylation process could be affected by environmental (e.g. diet) or endogenous (e.g., adipocyte differentiation, inflammation, hypoxia) factors, and could influence adipocyte leptin gene expression. The aim of this article was to study whether a high-energy diet may affect leptin gene promoter methylation in rats. A group of eleven male Wistar rats were assigned into two dietary groups, one fed on a control diet for 11 weeks and the other on a high-fat cafeteria diet. Rats fed a high-energy diet become overweight and hyperleptinemic as compared to the controls. DNA isolated from retroperitoneal adipocytes was treated with bisulfite and a distal portion of leptin promoter (from -694 to -372 bp) including 13 CpG sites was amplified by PCR and sequenced. The studied promoter portion was slightly more methylated in the cafeteria-fed animals, which was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) for one of the CpG sites (located at the position -443). In obese rats, such methylation was associated to lower circulating leptin levels, suggesting that this position could be important in the regulation of leptin gene expression, probably by being a target sequence of different transcription factors. Our findings reveal, for the first time, that leptin methylation pattern can be influenced by diet-induced obesity, and suggest that epigenetic mechanisms could be involved in obesity by regulating the expression of important epiobesigenic genes.",

    "title": "Gene expression profiling of 3T3-L1 adipocytes exposed to phloretin.",
    "abstract": "Adipocyte dysfunction plays a major role in the outcome of obesity, insulin resistance and related cardiovascular complications. Thus, considerable efforts are underway in the pharmaceutical industry to find molecules that target the now well-documented pleiotropic functions of adipocyte. We previously reported that the dietary flavonoid phloretin enhances 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation and adiponectin expression at least in part through PPAR gamma activation. The present study was designed to further characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying the phloretin-mediated effects on 3T3-L1 adipocytes using microarray technology. We show that phloretin positively regulates the expression of numerous genes involved in lipogenesis and triglyceride storage, including GLUT4, ACSL1, PEPCK1, lipin-1 and perilipin (more than twofold). The expression of several genes encoding adipokines, in addition to adiponectin and its receptor, is positively or negatively regulated in a way that suggests a possible reduction in systemic insulin resistance and obesity-associated inflammation. Improvement of insulin sensitivity is also suggested by the overexpression of genes associated with insulin signal transduction, such as CAP, PDK1 and Akt2. Many of these genes are PPAR gamma targets, confirming the involvement of PPAR gamma pathway in the phloretin effects on adipocytes. In light of these microarray data, it is reasonable to assume that phloretin may be beneficial for reducing insulin resistance, in a similar way to the thiazolidinedione class of antidiabetic drugs.",

    "title": "Stimulation of cardiac fatty acid oxidation by leptin is mediated by a nitric oxide-p38 MAPK-dependent mechanism.",
    "abstract": "Leptin has previously been shown to stimulate fatty acid oxidation independent of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Nitric oxide and p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) are known effectors of leptin signaling. The aim of the present study was to determine whether nitric oxide and p38 MAPK mediate the stimulation of leptin by MAPK. Hearts from male Sprague-Dawley rats were mounted on the isolated perfused working heart in the presence or absence of leptin (1.9 nM), N-Nitro-L-Arginine Methyl Ester (L-NAME) (3 microM), the specific p38 MAPK inhibitor 4-[4-(4-Fluorophenyl)-5-(4-pyridinyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl] phenol (SB202190, 2 microM) and the specific STAT-3 inhibitor (E)-2-Cyano-3-(3,4-dihydrophenyl)-N-(phenylmethyl)-2-propenamide (AG490, 5 microM) for the measurement of substrate metabolism and function. AMPK and carnitine palimitoyltransferase-1 activity, nitrate/nitrite levels, STAT-3 phosphorylation and p38 MAPK phosphorylation were measured. To assess mitochondrial function, hearts were perfused with or without leptin prior to the isolation of mitochondria. Leptin stimulated fatty acid oxidation and decreased cardiac function, associated with the activation of STAT-3 and p38 MAPK and an increase in tissue nitrate/nitrite levels; the effect on function was ameliorated and the effect on fatty acid oxidation was prevented by L-NAME, B202190 and AG490. L-NAME lowered tissue nitrate/nitrite levels, and prevented the phosphorylation of p38, whereas SB202190 had no effect on tissue nitrate/nitrite levels. AG490 also lowered tissue nitrate/nitrite levels. Leptin had no effect on fatty acid-dependent mitochondrial respiration or uncoupling activity, but, surprisingly, stimulated pyruvate-dependent mitochondrial respiration. These data indicate that leptin stimulates fatty acid oxidation by a STAT-3-nitric oxide-p38 MAPK-dependent mechanism. The target of the pathway is upstream of the mitochondria.",

    "title": "[Apelin signalisation and vascular physiopathology].",
    "abstract": "The formation of the vascular system is an early step in organogenesis that involves the participation of various signalling pathways. Integration of the extracellular signals decoded by their cognate membrane receptors orchestrate the cell events, which act at different stages, from the primitive network formed by vasculogenesis to the arborescent network remodeled by angiogenesis. Our laboratory showed the participation of a new signalling pathway in physiological angiogenesis and tumour neovascularisation. This signalling pathway named apelin comprises a G protein-coupled receptor and a peptide ligand. Expression of apelin receptors is observed during the embryonic formation of blood vessels where it is localized in the endothelium. In HUVECs, which endogenously express apelin receptors, apelin promotes the phosphorylation of ERKs, Akt and p70 S6 Kinase. In addition, apelin increases in vitro the proliferation of these endothelial cells. Finally, injection of apelin in the vitreous induces in vivo the sprouting and the proliferation of endothelial cells from the retinal vascular network. Accordingly, all these results led us to study the role of apelin signalling in tumour neovascularisation. In two tumoral cell lines, we showed that hypoxia induces the expression of apelin gene. In addition, the overexpression of apelin gene resulting from stable transfection of these cell lines clearly accelerates in vivo tumour growth, as a consequence of an increased number of vessels irrigating these tumours. The pathological relevance of these data has been validated by the characterization of an overexpression of apelin gene in one third of human tumours. Taken together, apelin signalling is both involved in physiological angiogenesis and pathological neoangiogenesis, and therefore represents an interesting pharmacological target for anti-angiogenic therapies.",

    "abstract": "In bone marrow, osteoblasts and adipocytes are differentiated from mesenchymal progenitor cells and their differentiation is reciprocally regulated by largely unknown mechanisms. In this study, we investigated downstream signaling cascades of adiponectin, a member of the adipocytokine family, in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation. Adiponectin augmented expression of several osteogenic marker genes and increased osteoblast differentiation in mesenchymal progenitor cells. The expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) was potently increased by adiponectin, whereas inhibition of COX2 activity abolished the effect of adiponectin on osteogenesis. In addition, adiponectin rapidly stimulated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase via the adiponectin receptor, AdipoR1, which resulted in c-Jun activation for COX2 expression. Adiponectin also stimulated BMP2 expression in a COX2-dependent manner. Moreover, Runx2, a key osteogenic transcription factor, contributed to the acceleration of osteogenesis in the presence of adiponectin. Collectively, the finding that adiponectin could promote osteogenesis through an intracellular signaling cascade in mesenchymal progenitor cells suggests that adiponectin would be a potential therapeutic target for bone-related diseases.",

    "title": "Rosiglitazone increases the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma target genes in adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle in the sheep fetus in late gestation.",
    "abstract": "Exposure to maternal overnutrition increases the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) in adipose tissue before birth, and it has been proposed that the precocial activation of PPARgamma target genes may lead to increased fat deposition in postnatal life. In this study, we determined the effect of intrafetal administration of a PPARgamma agonist, rosiglitazone, on PPARgamma target gene expression in fetal adipose tissue as well indirect actions of rosiglitazone on fetal liver and skeletal muscle. Osmotic pumps containing rosiglitazone (n = 7) or vehicle (15% ethanol, n = 7) were implanted into fetuses at 123-126 d gestation (term = 150 +/- 3 d gestation). At 137-141 d gestation, tissues were collected and mRNA expression of PPARgamma, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), adiponectin, and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) in adipose tissue, PPARalpha and PPARgamma-coactivator 1alpha (PGC1alpha) in liver and muscle and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) in liver determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Plasma insulin concentrations were lower in rosiglitazone-treated fetuses (P &lt; 0.02). Rosiglitazone treatment resulted in increased expression of LPL and adiponectin mRNA (P &lt; 0.01) in fetal adipose tissue. The expression of PPARalpha mRNA in liver (P &lt; 0.05) and PGC1alpha mRNA (P &lt; 0.02) in skeletal muscle were also increased by rosiglitazone treatment. Rosiglitazone treatment increased expression of PPARgamma target genes within fetal adipose tissue and also had direct or indirect actions on the fetal liver and muscle. The effects of activating PPARgamma in fetal adipose tissue mimic those induced by prenatal overnutrition, and it is therefore possible that activation of PPARgamma may be the initiating mechanism in the pathway from prenatal overnutrition to postnatal obesity.",

    "abstract": "Clozapine is the most effective agent in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. However, it is frequently associated with excessive body weight (BW) gain, type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia. The antidiabetic metformin (MET) has proved effective to assist in BW control during olanzapine administration. Therefore, we aimed to test whether MET may improve the metabolic profile in patients under prolonged clozapine administration. In a double-blind, parallel group protocol, 61 patients (94.4% with schizophrenia) receiving clozapine (196.8+/-132 mg daily, range: 25-500) for more than 3 consecutive months (86.5+/-40.6 months, range: 4-168) were randomly allocated to extended release MET (n=31; 500 to 1000 mg daily) or placebo (n=30) group for 14 weeks. The BW, the body mass index, waist circumference, serum glucose, insulin, lipids, glycated hemoglobin (HBA1c), leptin and cortisol, and the HOMA-IR index were assessed at baseline, and weeks 7 and 14. MET was well tolerated and the mental state was not impaired during the study. The protocol was completed by all the placebo subjects and by 24 MET-treated patients. In a complete analysis at week 14, without including data of the 7 dropouts, the MET group lost -1.87+/-2.9 kg, whereas the placebo group had a stable BW: 0.16+/-2.9 kg, p=0.01 for the between group comparisons (effect size: 0.70). Leptin levels also tended to decrease after MET (p=0.08). Insulin and the triglyceride-HDL-C ratio significantly decreased (p&lt;0.05, effect size 0.59 and 1.99 respectively) and the HDL-C significantly increased (p=0.001, effect size 0.95) after MET.

    "title": "Adiponectin: a key adipokine in alcoholic fatty liver.",
    "abstract": "Alcoholic fatty liver is a major risk factor for advanced liver injuries such as steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. While the underlying mechanisms are multiple, the development of alcoholic fatty liver has been attributed to a combined increase in the rate of de novo lipogenesis and a decrease in the rate of fatty acid oxidation in animal liver. Among various transcriptional regulators, the hepatic SIRT1 (sirtuin 1)-AMPK (AMPK-activated kinase) signaling system represents a central target for the action of ethanol in the liver. Adiponectin is one of the adipocyte-derived adipokines with potent lipid-lowering properties. Growing evidence has demonstrated that the development of alcoholic fatty liver is associated with reduced circulating adiponectin levels, decreased hepatic adiponectin receptor expression, and impaired hepatic adiponectin signaling. Adiponectin confers protection against alcoholic fatty liver via modulation of complex hepatic signaling pathways largely controlled by the central regulatory system, SIRT1-AMPK axis. This review aims to integrate the current research findings of ethanol-mediated dysregulation of adiponectin and its receptors and to provide a comprehensive point of view for understanding the role of adiponectin signaling in the development of alcoholic fatty liver.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin is widely known as an adipocytokine with therapeutic potential for its markedly protective function in the pathogenesis of obesity-related disorders, metabolic syndrome, systemic insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease and more recently carcinogenesis. In the present study, we show that adiponectin inhibits adhesion, invasion and migration of breast cancer cells. Further analysis of the underlying molecular mechanisms revealed that adiponectin treatment increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and activity as evident by increased phosphorylation of downstream target of AMPK, acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase and inhibition of p70S6 kinase (S6K). Intriguingly, we discovered that adiponectin treatment increases the expression of tumor suppressor gene LKB1 in breast cancer cells. Overexpression of LKB1 in breast cancer cells further increased adiponectin-mediated phosphorylation of AMPK. Using isogenic LKB1 knockdown cell line pair, we found that LKB1 is required for adiponectin-mediated modulation of AMPK-S6K axis and more importantly, inhibition of adhesion, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Taken together these data present a novel mechanism involving specific upregulation of tumor suppressor gene LKB1 by which adiponectin inhibits adhesion, invasion and migration of breast cancer cells. Our findings indicate the possibility of using adiponectin analogues to inhibit invasion and migration of breast cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Obesity in human was found mainly due to the poor transportation of leptin through brain-blood barrier (BBB), called as leptin resistance. To produce a leptin capable of penetrating BBB, we have added Tat-PTD(9) to the C terminal of leptin to construct a fusion protein. The fusion Tat-leptin and native leptin genes were synthesized by single-step insertion of a polymerase chain reaction and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (Rosseta). The expressing products were purified and renatured by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography, and identified by the molecular size in SDS-PAGE gel and by its immunoreactivity to specific antibody with Western-blotting assay. To bio-functionally evaluate the fusion protein, Balb/c mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD) were given Tat-leptin, leptin or saline for 19 days. The immunohistochemical staining showed the increases in positive stains for the leptin in the region of hypothalamus of the HFD mice with either Tat-leptin or leptin as compared to saline group, but the staining intensity and frequency in the group with Tat-leptin were stronger and higher than those in the group with leptin. Furthermore, the most efficiency in preventing the body-weight gain caused by HFD was found in Tat-leptin group among these three groups. These results suggest that Tat-modified leptin may become a great potential candidate for the prevention or therapy of obese patients.",

    "title": "Adipose tissue as target organ in the treatment of hormone-dependent breast cancer: new therapeutic perspectives.",
    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the female malignant neoplasia with the highest incidence in the industrialized world. Despite many undeniable therapeutic successes obtained, breast cancer still remains, however, a major health issue. In the last few years, thanks to aromatase inhibitors, the hormone therapy for oestrogen-dependent breast cancer has evolved in terms of efficacy and tolerability; at the same time, it has enabled us to better define the role of oestrogens in the etiopathogenesis of this tumour. Weight increase and obesity have been identified as the most important risk and prognostic factors for breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the association of obesity with postmenopausal breast cancer. A more recent hypothesis suggests that adipocytes and their autocrine (paracrine and endocrine actions) are at the centre of such an etiopathogenetic mechanism. A better understanding of the main mechanisms that link together menopause, body-weight increase and hormone-dependent breast cancer is paramount to enable the identification of key molecules involved in the development of breast carcinoma and suggest new therapeutic options. The present review will discuss important findings on the therapeutic aspects of adipose tissue and adipokines as a target for treatment of hormone-dependent breast cancer.",

    "title": "The action of leptin in the ventral tegmental area to decrease food intake is dependent on Jak-2 signaling.",
    "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that leptin reduces food intake via actions in the brain circuitry of food reward, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA), as leptin receptors are present in the VTA, and leptin injection in the VTA reduces food intake. In the hypothalamus, leptin-induced anorexia requires signaling via Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak-STAT), insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). In this study, we determined whether leptin activates each of these signal transduction pathways in the VTA and whether these signaling pathways are required for VTA-leptin induced anorexia. Here, we show that pSTAT3-Tyr(705), a marker of leptin activation, was induced in a midbrain region containing the VTA and substantia nigra following either intracerebroventricular leptin or direct administration of leptin to the VTA, but these interventions failed to increase levels of either pAKT-Ser(473) or phospho-p70S6K-Thr(389), markers of IRS-PI 3-kinase and mTOR signaling, respectively. Moreover, the effect of intra-VTA leptin administration to reduce 4- and 20-h food intake and 20-h body weight was blocked by an inhibitor of Jak-2, at a dose that had no effect on food intake or body weight by itself, but not by local inhibition of either PI 3-kinase (LY-294002) or mTOR (rapamycin) in this timeframe. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that leptin signaling in the VTA is involved in the regulation of energy balance, but, in contrast to the leptin signaling in the hypothalamus, these effects are mediated predominantly via Jak-2 signaling rather than via the IRS-PI 3-kinase or mTOR signaling pathway.",

    "title": "Leptin inhibits glycogen synthase kinase-3beta to prevent tau phosphorylation in neuronal cells.",
    "abstract": "We have previously demonstrated that Leptin reduces extracellular amyloid beta (Abeta) protein both in vitro and in vivo, and intracellular tau phosphorylation in vitro. Further, we have shown that these effects are dependent on activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in vitro. Herein, we investigated downstream effectors of AMPK signaling directly linked to tau phosphorylation. One such target, of relevance to Alzheimer's disease (AD), may be GSK-3beta, which has been shown to be inactivated by Leptin. We therefore dissected the role of GSK-3beta in mediating Leptin's ability to reduce tau phosphorylation in neuronal cells. Our data suggest that Leptin regulates tau phosphorylation through a pathway involving both AMPK and GSK-3beta. This was based on the following: Leptin and the cell-permeable AMPK activator, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxyamide ribonucleoside (AICAR), reduced tau phosphorylation at AD-relevant sites similarly to the GSK-3beta inhibitor, lithium chloride (LiCl). Further, this reduction of tau phosphorylation was mimicked by the downregulation of GSK-3beta, achieved using siRNA technology and antagonized by the ectopic overexpression of GSK-3beta. These studies provide further insight into Leptin's mechanism of action in suppressing AD-related pathways.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is the major cause of type 2 diabetes. In the mid 1990s interest in adipose tissue was revived by the discovery of leptin. The association of obesity and diabetes emphasizes their shared physiopathological features. At the end of the 1990s, ghrelin, a potent gastric orexigenic factor, was found to be involved in obesity. Leptin and ghrelin have opposite actions in several tissues including the regulation of feeding in the brain. To survey the role of leptin and ghrelin in glucose metabolism. We summarize the current state of research and discuss the roles of ghrelin and leptin in glucose homeostases and the potential application of drugs targeting leptin and ghrelin signalling to prevent and treat diabetes. A pressing challenge is to determine how leptin, ghrelin and other adipokines or gastric factors are involved in metabolic disorders. Answering these questions will require the development of new pharmacological tools that target specific adipokine systems. Hopefully, new therapeutic targets will be identified.",

    "title": "Hypothalamic melanocortin signaling and leptin resistance--perspective of therapeutic application for obesity-diabetes syndrome.",
    "abstract": "The adipocyte-derived hormone, leptin controls feeding behavior, augments fatty acid beta-oxidation in the skeletal muscle, attenuates insulin secretion but enhances whole body insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal, thereby serving as a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. Along with other researchers, we demonstrated the clinical efficacy and safety of leptin in the treatment of diabetes and dyslipidemia for patients with generalized lipodystrophy. However, the clinical application of leptin has been hampered by the notion that leptin does not fully exert its metabolic effects in human obesity and diet-induced obese rodents. We found that the activity of skeletal muscle AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) parallels hypothalamic leptin sensitivity and metabolic phenotype in transgenic mice overexpressing leptin. Our data indicate that the activation of skeletal muscle AMPK is mediated by the hypothalamic melanocortin pathway. In fact, intracerebroventricular administration of melanocortin agonist, MT-II in mice robustly overcomes high-fat diet-induced leptin resistance and ameliorates fuel dyshomeostasis and hyperphagia, with a concomitant recovery of AMPK activity in skeletal muscle. Conversely, AMPK/ACC phosphorylation by leptin was abrogated by the co-administration of melanocortin antagonist, SHU9119 and in the KKA(y) mice, which centrally express endogenous melanocortin antagonist. Importantly, high-fat diet-induced attenuation of AMPK/ACC phosphorylation in leptin-overexpressing transgenic mice was not reversed by central leptin per se, but was markedly recovered by MT-II. Our data provide evidence for the critical role of the central melanocortin system in leptin-skeletal muscle AMPK axis, and highlight the system as a therapeutic target for leptin insuffciency in obese humans.",

    "abstract": "Hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation is a key step in the hepatic fibrogenic process. Increasing evidence demonstrates the pro-fibrogenic action of leptin in rodent liver. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) is a potential molecular target for inhibition of HSC activation. Our previous study suggested that leptin markedly down-regulated PPARgamma gene expression in HSCs. The aim of this study is to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of leptin on PPARgamma expression in rat HSCs in vitro. The effects of leptin on the expression and trans-activation activity of early growth response-1 (Egr-1) are examined by using real-time PCR, Western blotting analysis, transient transfection, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The role of Egr-1 in PPARgamma gene expression is demonstrated by co-transfection approach, Western blotting analysis and real-time PCR. We document that leptin increases Egr-1 expression at protein and mRNA levels, and significantly stimulates Egr-1 trans-activation activity. Moreover, leptin induces the expression and activity of Egr-1 through activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT signaling (PI-3K/AKT) pathway. Further investigation reveals that Egr-1 exerts a clear inhibitory effect on the promoter activity and expression of PPARgamma gene and demonstrates that Egr-1 increases the expression of HSC activation markers and promotes HSC growth. Taken together, these findings suggest that Egr-1 is involved in the inhibitory effect of leptin on PPARgamma expression in rat HSCs in vitro. Our results provide novel insights into the mechanisms of leptin-induced inhibition of PPARgamma expression in HSCs in vitro.",

    "title": "Prodrug delivery of novel PTP1B inhibitors to enhance insulin signalling.",
    "abstract": "A growing percentage of the population is resistant to two key hormones - insulin and leptin - as a result of increased obesity, often leading to significant health consequences such as type 2 diabetes. Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a key negative regulator of signalling by both of these hormones, so that inhibitors of this enzyme may provide promise for correcting endocrine abnormalities in both diabetes and obesity. As with other tyrosine phosphatases, identification of viable drug candidates targeting PTP1B has been elusive because of the nature of its active site. Beginning with novel phosphotyrosine mimetics, we have designed some of the most potent PTP1B inhibitors. However, their highly acidic structures limit intrinsic permeability and pharmacokinetics. Ester prodrugs of these inhibitors improve their drug-like properties with the goal of delivering these nanomolar inhibitors to the cytoplasm of cells within target tissues. In addition to identifying prodrugs that is able to deliver active drugs into cells to inhibit PTP1B and increase insulin signalling, these compounds were further modified to gain a variety of cleavage properties for targeting activity in vivo. One such prodrug candidate improved insulin sensitivity in ob/ob mice, with lowered fasting blood glucose levels seen in the context of lowered fasting insulin levels following 4 days of intraperitoneal dosing. The results presented in this study highlight the potential for design of orally active drug candidates targeting PTP1B, while also delineating the considerable challenges remaining.",

    "title": "Control of food intake and energy expenditure by amylin-therapeutic implications.",
    "abstract": "Amylin is a pancreatic B-cell hormone that plays an important role in the control of nutrient fluxes because it reduces food intake, slows gastric emptying, and reduces postprandial glucagon secretion. These actions seem to depend on a direct effect on the area postrema (AP). Subsequent to area AP activation, the amylin signal is conveyed to the forebrain via distinct relay stations. Within the lateral hypothalamic area, amylin diminishes the expression of orexigenic neuropeptides. Recent studies suggest that amylin may also play a role as a long term, adiposity signal. Similar to leptin or insulin, an infusion of amylin into the brain resulted in lower body weight gain than in controls, irrespective of the starting body weight. Interestingly, preliminary data also suggest that rats fed an energy-dense diet develop resistance to central amylin. In addition to amylin's action to control meal termination and to act as a potential adiposity signal, amylin and its agonist salmon calcitonin have recently been shown to increase energy expenditure under certain conditions. In summary, amylin may be an interesting target as a body weight lowering drug. In fact, recent studies provide evidence that amylin, especially when combined with other anorectic hormones (for example, peptide YY and leptin) has beneficial long-term effects on body weight.",

The ease with which the levels of adiponectin can be measured owing to its high abundance, small diurnal variation and high stability in plasma have made it a popular target for measurements in many clinical studies. It has emerged as a valuable biomarker for insulin sensitivity, cardiovascular risk and inflammation. However, adiponectin levels have been measured in many additional disease states. Preclinical studies not only have implicated adiponectin as an outstanding biomarker but also have demonstrated direct cardio-protective and insulin-sensitizing properties to be associated with the protein. Adiponectin might, therefore, be a viable protein therapeutic that could be supplied in a recombinant form in the context of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. However, the high abundance, complex tertiary and quaternary structure and rapid turnover might make chronic administration of the protein rather challenging.",

    "abstract": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) activation in rodents is thought to improve insulin sensitivity by decreasing ectopic lipids in non-adipose tissues. Fenofibrate, a lipid-modifying agent that acts as a PPARalpha agonist, may prevent adipocyte hypertrophy and insulin resistance by increasing intracellular lipolysis from adipose tissue. Consistent with this hypothesis, fenofibrate decreased visceral fat mass and adipocyte size in high fat diet-fed obese mice, and concomitantly increased the expression of PPARalpha target genes involved in fatty acid beta-oxidation in both epididymal adipose tissue and differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. However, mRNA levels of adipose marker genes, such as leptin and TNFalpha, were decreased in epididymal adipose tissue by fenofibrate treatment. Fenofibrate not only reduced circulating levels of free fatty acids and triglycerides, but also normalized hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia in obese mice. Blood glucose levels of fenofibrate-treated mice were significantly reduced during intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test compared with obese controls. These results suggest that fenofibrate-induced fatty acid beta-oxidation in visceral adipose tissue may be one of the major factors leading to decreased adipocyte size and improved insulin sensitivity.",

Many factors are known to affect vascular function and this review focuses on the role of adipokines and obesity in this process. Growing evidence suggests that adipose-derived adipokines, such as cytokines, chemokines and hormones, plays a significant role in the regulation of vascular function. Inhibition of vascular reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and lowering plasma free fatty acid level are all potential therapeutic targets for type 2 diabetes-induced vascular dysfunction. Bariatric surgery is a relatively new and more aggressive treatment for the morbidly obese patient that also results in an instant and obvious improvement of vascular function through as yet unexplained mechanisms. These therapies show great promise for the prevention and cure of diabetes-induced vascular dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Adipokines that modulate metabolic and inflammatory responses, such as resistin (rstn) and fasting-induced adipose factor (fiaf), are also expressed in mouse brain and pituitary gland. Since lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxinemia provokes an anorectic response via a hypothalamic-dependent mechanism we hypothesized that LPS would also modify hypothalamic adipokine expression. Challenging male CD-1 mice with LPS (5 mg/kg; s.c.) significantly reduced bodyweight (24 h) and realtime RT-PCR revealed time- and tissue-dependent increases in rstn, fiaf and suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (socs-3) mRNA in hypothalamic, pituitary, cortical and adipose tissues. Gene expression was rapidly increased (3-6 h) in the hypothalamus and pituitary, but returned to normal within 24 h. In contrast, with the exception of rstn in fat, the expression of target genes remained elevated in cortex and visceral fat at 24 h post-injection. In order to more specifically examine the hypothalamic response to LPS we investigated its effects directly on N-1 hypothalamic neurons in vitro. LPS (25 microg/mL; 3 h) had no effect on rstn mRNA, but significantly stimulated fiaf and socs-3 expression. Although various toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) antagonists (parthenolide, PD098059, and SB202190) did not prevent the LPS-induced increases in fiaf and socs-3, they did partially attenuate its stimulatory effects. We conclude that LPS treatment increases the expression of central, and possibly neuronal, adipokine genes which may influence local tissue repair and function, but could also have downstream consequences on the hypothalamic control of appetite and energy metabolism following an inflammatory insult.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin (ADPN) is an adipocyte-derived protein with potential antiatherogenic properties. In the general population, ADPN serum levels are associated with age and body mass index (BMI), type 2 diabetes and presumably cardiovascular disease. The suspected vascular-protective effects are mediated by several mechanisms such as insulin sensitizing, maintaining endovascular homeostasis and anti-inflammatory properties. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are subjected to an increased cardiovascular risk. The underlying mechanisms are not yet completely understood although in the last few years numerous studies have linked secondary hyperparathyroidism and inflammation to that risk. It is currently not clear whether, in CKD, ADPN plays the same role as it is thought to do in the general population or if the uremic environment overwhelms the vascular-protective impact of ADPN. Therefore, characterizing ADPN levels and kinetics in CKD and comparing its concentrations with surrogate markers of cardiovascular risk in CKD might contribute to a better understanding of adipocytokine signaling in renal disease. The review summarizes the available literature on ADPN measurement, regulation and therapeutic potential in general population and CKD. In our investigations, ADPN was more than twofold increased in hemodialysis patients compared with the general population. ADPN levels were not associated with age, but with lifetime spent on dialysis (vintage) and BMI. The dialysis procedure had no effect on ADPN. To assess the clinical value of ADPN levels as a potential surrogate of cardiovascular risk in or therapeutic target in CKD, end point-driven studies with special regard to the risk behavior in CKD have to be performed.",

    "abstract": "Adipose tissue secretes factors linked to colon cancer risk including leptin. A hallmark of cancer is sustained angiogenesis. While leptin promotes angiogenesis in adipose tissue, it is unknown whether leptin can induce epithelial cells to produce factors that may drive angiogenesis, vascular development and therefore cancer progression. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of leptin-stimulated colon epithelial cells differing in adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) genotype (gatekeeper tumor suppressor gene for colon cancer) on angiogenesis. We employed novel colonic epithelial cell lines derived from the Immorto mouse [young adult mouse colon (YAMC)] and the Immorto-Min mouse [Immorto-Min colonic epithelial cell (IMCE)], which carries the Apc Min mutation, to study the effects of leptin-stimulated colon epithelial cells on angiogenesis. We utilized ex vivo rat mesenteric capillary bioassay and human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) models to study angiogenesis. IMCE cells stimulated with leptin produced significantly more vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) than YAMC (268 +/- 18 versus 124 +/- 8 pg/ml; P &lt; 0.01) cells. Leptin treatment induced dose-dependent increases in VEGF only in IMCE cells. Conditioned media from leptin (50 ng/ml)-treated IMCE cells induced significant capillary formation compared with control, which was blocked by the addition of a neutralizing antibody against VEGF. Conditioned media from leptin-treated IMCE cells also induced HUVEC cell proliferation, chemotaxis, upregulation of adhesion proteins and cell-signaling activation resulting in nuclear factor kappa B nuclear translocation and DNA binding due to VEGF. This is the first study demonstrating that leptin can induce preneoplastic colon epithelial cells to orchestrate VEGF-driven angiogenesis and vascular development, thus providing a specific mechanism and potential target for obesity-associated cancer.",

    "abstract": "A large number of studies revealed that adiponectin, a protein secreted specifically by adipose tissue, exhibits antiinflammatory, antiatherogenic, and antidiabetic properties. This 247-amino acid protein contains four differentiable domains and exists in five different configurations, which binds three kinds of receptors. The plasma adiponectin concentration is at amazing microgram level and the gender difference is very clear. Obese subjects showed decreased plasma level of adiponectin while exercise seems to restore it. Many researchers demonstrated that it could be a reliable biomarker for multiple diseases. However, there is controversy about its role in inflammation since its plasma concentration decreases in some inflammatory diseases and increases under some other inflammatory conditions. The signal transduction pathway is still not very clear yet. Could adiponectin be a promising drug target?",

    "abstract": "A variety of metabolic/molecular changes in obese adipose tissue considerably contribute to the pathophysiology of life style-related diseases. Fat cell-derived hormone leptin controls appetite and energy homeostasis, thereby enhancing whole body insulin sensitivity. However, clinical application of leptin for the treatment of obesity/metabolic syndrome has been hampered by the fact that leptin does not fully exert its beneficial metabolic impact on prevalent forms of obesity. In an attempt to elucidate underlying mechanism of leptin resistance in obesity, we found that the activity of skeletal muscle AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) tightly parallels hypothalamic leptin sensitivity and metabolic phenotype in transgenic mice overexpressing leptin. Actually, intracerebroventricular administration of melanocortin agonist MT-II robustly overcomes high fat diet-induced leptin resistance and ameliorates fuel dyshomeostasis and hyperphagia in mice, with a concomitant recovery of AMPK activity in skeletal muscle, thereby highlighting the system as a therapeutic target for leptin resistance. In this context, type 4 melanocortin receptor is a promising drug target for the treatment of obesity/metabolic syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Obesity-associated inflammation causes insulin resistance. Obese adipose tissue displays hypertrophied adipocytes and increased expression of the cannabinoid-1 receptor. Cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP) increases heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) activity, increasing adiponectin and reducing inflammatory cytokines. We hypothesize that CoPP administration to Zucker diabetic fat (ZDF) rats would improve insulin sensitivity and remodel adipose tissue. Twelve-week-old Zucker lean and ZDF rats were divided into 4 groups: Zucker lean, Zucker lean-CoPP, ZDF, and ZDF-CoPP. Control groups received vehicle and treatment groups received CoPP (2 mg/kg body weight) once weekly for 6 weeks. Serum insulin levels and glucose response to insulin injection were measured. At 18 weeks of age, rats were euthanized, and aorta, kidney, and subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues were harvested. HO-1 expression was measured by Western blot analysis and HO-1 activity by serum carbon monoxide content. Adipocyte size and cannabinoid-1 expression were measured. Adipose tissue volumes were determined using MRI. CoPP significantly increased HO-1 activity, phosphorylated AKT and phosphorylated AMP kinase, and serum adiponectin in ZDF rats. HO-1 induction improved hyperinsulinemia and insulin sensitivity in ZDF rats. Subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue volumes were significantly decreased in ZDF rats. Adipocyte size and cannabinoid-1 expression were both significantly reduced in ZDF-CoPP rats in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues. This study demonstrates that HO-1 induction improves insulin sensitivity, downregulates the peripheral endocannabinoid system, reduces adipose tissue volume, and causes adipose tissue remodeling in a model of obesity-induced insulin resistance. These findings suggest HO-1 as a potential therapeutic target for obesity and its associated health risks.",

    "abstract": "Protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)-1B antagonizes insulin signaling and is a potential therapeutic target for insulin resistance associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes. To date, studies of PTP-1B have been limited by the availability of specific antagonists; however, treatment of rodents with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) directed against PTP-1B improves insulin sensitivity, inhibits lipogenic gene expression, and reduces triglyceride accumulation in liver and adipose tissue. Here we investigated ASO-mediated PTP-1B inhibition in primates. First, PTP-1B ASO (ISIS 113715) dose-dependently inhibited PTP-1B mRNA and protein expression in cultured monkey hepatocytes. Subcutaneous administration of ISIS 113715 reduced PTP-1B mRNA expression in liver and adipose tissue of normal-weight monkeys by 40-50% and improved insulin sensitivity during an iv glucose tolerance test (IVGTT). In obese, insulin-resistant rhesus monkeys, treatment with 20 mg/kg ISIS 113715 for 4 wk reduced fasting concentrations of insulin and glucose and reduced insulin responses during an IVGTT. In these animals, adiponectin concentrations were also increased by 70%, most of which was an increase of high-molecular-weight oligomers. These effects were not observed in monkeys on a lower, dose-escalation regimen (1-10 mg/kg over 9 wk). Overall, the increase of adiponectin concentrations during ISIS 113715 treatment was correlated with the lowering of insulin responses during IVGTT (r = -0.47, P = 0.042). These results indicate that inhibition of PTP-1B with ASOs such as ISIS 113715 may be a viable approach for the treatment and prevention of obesity-associated insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes because they potently increase adiponectin concentrations in addition to improving insulin sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin is a peptide hormone secreted by adipose tissue. It is a key hormone responsible for insulin sensitization, and its circulating level is inversely associated with abdominal obesity. Recent studies have shown that a reduced plasma adiponectin level is significantly correlated with the risk of various cancers. However, there are few studies regarding the association of adiponectin and colorectal cancer. To address this issue, we investigated the effect of adiponectin on colorectal cancer cells. Three colorectal cancer cell lines express both AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 receptors. MTT assay revealed that adiponectin inhibited human colorectal cancer cell growth. Furthermore, Western blot analysis revealed that adiponectin activated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and suppressed mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways. Selective AMPK inhibitor compound C abrogated the inhibitory effect of adiponectin on cell growth. Our results clearly demonstrate the novel findings that adiponectin inhibits colorectal cancer cell growth via activation of AMPK, thereby down-regulating the mTOR pathway.",

    "abstract": "Population studies provide evidence that obesity and insulin resistance are associated not only with elevated serum insulin levels and reduced serum adiponectin levels but also with increased risk of aggressive prostate and colon cancer. We show here that adiponectin activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in colon (HT-29) and prostate (PC-3) cancer cells. These results are consistent with prior observations in myocytes, but we show that in epithelial cancer cells AMPK activation is associated with reduction in mammalian target of rapamycin activation as estimated by Ser(2448) phosphorylation, with reduction in p70S6 kinase activation as estimated by Thr(389) phosphorylation, with ribosomal protein S6 activation as estimated by Ser(235/236) phosphorylation, with reduction in protein translation as estimated by [(35)S]methionine incorporation, and with growth inhibition. Adiponectin-induced growth inhibition is significantly attenuated when AMPK level is reduced using small interfering RNA, indicating that AMPK is involved in mediating the antiproliferative action of this adipokine. Thus, adiponectin has the characteristics of a AMPK-dependent growth inhibitor that is deficient in obesity, and this may contribute to the adverse effects of obesity on neoplastic disease. Furthermore, metformin was observed to activate AMPK and to have growth inhibitory actions on prostate and colon cancer cells, suggesting that this compound may be of particular value in attenuating the adverse effects of obesity on neoplasia.",

    "abstract": "Resistin antagonizes insulin action in mouse, making it a potential therapeutic target for treating metabolic diseases such as diabetes. To better understand how mouse resistin gene (Retn) expression is restricted to fat tissue, we identified an adipocyte-specific enhancer located approximately 8.8-kb upstream of the transcription start site. This region contains a binding site for the master adipogenic regulator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), and binds endogenous PPARgamma together with its partner retinoid-X receptor alpha (RXRalpha). It also contains three binding sites for CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP), and is bound by endogenous C/EBPalpha and C/EBPbeta in adipocytes. Exogenous expression of PPARgamma/RXRalpha and C/EBPalpha in non-adipocyte cells synergistically drives robust expression from the enhancer. Although PPARgamma ligands repress Retn transcription in adipocytes, rosiglitazone paradoxically stimulates the enhancer activity, suggesting that the enhancer is not directly involved in negative regulation. Unlike expression of Retn in mouse, human resistin (RETN) is expressed primarily in macrophages. Interestingly, the region homologous to the mouse Retn enhancer in the human gene contains all three C/EBP elements, but is not conserved for the sequence bound by PPARgamma. Furthermore, it displays little or no binding by PPARgamma in vitro. Taken together, the data suggest that a composite enhancer binding both PPARgamma and C/EBP factors confers adipocyte-specific expression to Retn in mouse, and its absence from the human gene may explain the lack of adipocyte expression in humans.",

    "title": "Dorsal hindbrain 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase as an intracellular mediator of energy balance.",
    "abstract": "The fuel-sensing enzyme AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been implicated in central nervous system control of energy balance. Hypothalamic AMPK activity is increased by food deprivation, and this elevation is inhibited by refeeding or by leptin treatment. The contribution of extrahypothalamic AMPK activity in energy balance control has not been addressed. Here, we investigate the effects of physiological state on the AMPK activity in hindbrain nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) neurons because treatments that reduce energy availability in these neurons trigger behavioral, endocrine, and autonomic responses to restore energy balance. Food-deprived rats showed significantly increased AMPK activity in both NTS- and hypothalamus-enriched lysates compared with those that were ad libitum fed. Pharmacological inhibition of AMPK activity in medial NTS neurons, by intraparenchymal injection of compound C, suppressed food intake and body weight gain compared with vehicle. Fourth ventricle (4th i.c.v.) compound C delivery increased heart rate and spontaneous activity in free-moving rats. Suppression of AMPK activity has been implicated in leptin's anorectic action in the hypothalamus. Given the role of leptin signaling in food intake inhibition within the medial NTS, we also examined whether stimulation of hindbrain AMPK by 4th i.c.v. administration of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-riboside (AICAR), an AMP-mimicking promoter of AMPK activity, could attenuate the inhibition of food intake by 4th i.c.v. leptin. The intake-suppressive effects of leptin (at 2 and 4 h) were completely reversed by AICAR. We conclude that 1) hindbrain AMPK activity contributes to energy balance control through regulation of food intake and energy expenditure, 2) leptin's intake-reducing effects in the NTS are mediated by AMPK, and 3) central nervous system AMPK controls whole-body homeostasis at anatomically distributed sites across the neuraxis.",

As such visfatin may not only provide a potential new target for acute cardioprotection but it may also act as an anti-diabetic agent with a unique mechanism of action, thereby offering a potentially novel drug target for the diabetic patient that experiences an episode of acute myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury.",

    "title": "Hindbrain leptin stimulation induces anorexia and hyperthermia mediated by hindbrain melanocortin receptors.",
    "abstract": "Of the central nervous system receptors that could mediate the energy balance effects of leptin, those of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus receive the greatest attention. Melanocortin receptors (MC-Rs) contribute to the feeding and energetic effects of hypothalamically delivered leptin. Energy balance effects of leptin are also mediated by extrahypothalamic neurons including the hindbrain nucleus tractus solitarius. Hindbrain leptin receptors play a role in leptin's anorectic effects, but their contribution to its energetic effects and their functional interaction with melanocortin systems within the hindbrain remains unexplored. Here rats implanted with telemetric devices for recording energetic/cardiovascular responses were examined to determine whether: 1) hindbrain (fourth ventricular) leptin receptor stimulation triggers energetic and cardiovascular effects, 2) these effects are altered by a 6-wk high-fat diet maintenance, and 3) hindbrain MC-Rs mediate the thermogenic, cardiovascular, and anorexic effects of hindbrain leptin delivery. Results show that hindbrain leptin receptor stimulation produced long-lasting (&gt;6 h) increases in core temperature and heart rate and also decreased food intake and body weight. These responses were not altered by high-fat maintenance, in contrast to what has been reported for forebrain leptin delivery. Fourth ventricular pretreatment with MC-R antagonist SHU 9119 completely abolished the hyperthermia, anorexia, and body weight loss seen with hindbrain-directed leptin but had no effects of its own. These data highlight a role for hindbrain leptin receptors in the initiation of energetic and anorexic responses and show that MCRs are part of the downstream mediation of hindbrain leptin-induced energy balance effects, paralleling effects observed for hypothalamic leptin receptors.",

    "abstract": "Leptin controls food intake and energy expenditure by regulating hypothalamic neuron activities. Leptin exerts its actions through complex signaling pathways including STAT3 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and binding to target gene promoter/cofactor complexes. Deficient or defective leptin signaling leads to obesity, which may be caused by insufficient leptin levels and/or resistance to leptin signaling. To understand the molecular mechanisms of leptin resistance, we studied the regulation of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene expression by leptin. We show that phospho-STAT3 activates POMC promoter in response to leptin signaling through a mechanism that requires an SP1-binding site in the POMC promoter. Furthermore, FoxO1 binds to STAT3 and prevents STAT3 from interacting with the SP1.POMC promoter complex, and consequently, inhibits STAT3-mediated leptin action. Our study suggests that leptin action could be inhibited at a step downstream of STAT3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, and provides a potential mechanism of leptin resistance in which an increased FoxO1 antagonizes STAT3-mediated leptin signaling.",

    "title": "Leptin-enhanced neointimal hyperplasia is reduced by mTOR and PI3K inhibitors.",
    "abstract": "Despite the use of the sirolimus (rapamycin) drug-eluting coronary stent, diabetics are at increased risk of developing in-stent restenosis for unclear reasons. Hyperleptinemia, which often coexists with diabetes and metabolic syndrome, is an independent risk factor for progression of coronary artery disease. It has not been determined whether elevated circulating leptin decreases the efficacy of the sirolimus drug-eluting stent in inhibiting neointimal hyperplasia, the process underlying restenosis after stenting. Here we show that leptin activates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway in primary murine vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and stimulates VSMC proliferation in a PI3K-dependent fashion. Exogenous leptin, administered at levels comparable to those found in obese humans, promotes neointimal VSMC hyperplasia in a murine femoral artery wire injury model. Leptin significantly increases the dose of the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus that is required for effective inhibition of neointimal formation. Combination therapy with LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, and sirolimus effectively inhibits leptin-enhanced neointimal hyperplasia. These data show that, in the setting of hyperleptinemia, higher doses of an mTOR inhibitor, or combination therapy with mTOR and PI3K inhibitors, inhibits neointimal hyperplasia after arterial injury. These studies may explain the higher rates of restenosis observed in diabetics treated with a sirolimus-eluting coronary stent and suggest a potential novel therapeutic approach for inhibiting in-stent restenosis in such patients.",

    "title": "Regulation of adiponectin secretion by insulin and amino acids in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin is a fat cell-derived hormone with insulin-sensitizing properties. Low plasma adiponectin levels are associated with insulin resistance as found in obesity. One of the mechanisms for this finding is hampered insulin signaling via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) with concomitant decreased adiponectin secretion. Because insulin can also stimulate signaling at the level of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) by a mechanism that is dependent on the presence of amino acids, the role of mTOR signaling in adiponectin secretion was studied. In view of the vesicular nature of adiponectin secretion, the role of lysosomes was explored as well. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, both insulin and amino acids stimulated adiponectin secretion. The stimulation by insulin was PI3K dependent but mTOR independent. The stimulation by amino acids was independent of both PI3K and mTOR. Whereas the effect of insulin via PI3K was mainly on adiponectin secretion from adipocytes, the effect of amino acids was predominantly due to their role as substrates for adiponectin synthesis. The acidotropic agents ammonia and methylamine, but not the lysosomal protease inhibitor leupeptin and the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine, strongly inhibited adiponectin secretion and increased the intracellular adiponectin pool. In conclusion, adiponectin production is substrate driven. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and an acidic lysosomal pH, but not amino acid-mediated mTOR signaling or lysosomal breakdown, are involved in adiponectin secretion.",

    "abstract": "Production of 3-carbon units (as lactate) by granulosa cells (GCs) is important in follicular and oocyte development and may be modulated by metformin. The aim of the study was to examine the action of metformin on GC lactate production and potential mediation via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). GCs were prepared from follicular aspirates. After exposure to metformin and other potential modulators of AMPK in culture, aspects of cellular function were examined. The study was conducted in a private fertility clinic/university academic center. Women undergoing routine in vitro fertilization participated in the study. All agents were added in culture. Lactate output of GCs was measured. Cell extracts were prepared after culture, and phosphorylated forms of AMPK and acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) were assayed using Western analysis. Metformin led to a rapid increase in lactate production by GCs [minimum effective dose, 250 microm; maximum dose studied, 1 mm (1.22-fold; P &lt; 0.01)]. This dose range of metformin was similar to that required for stimulation of phospho-AMPK in GCs [minimum effective dose, 250 microm; maximum effect, 500 microm (2.01-fold; P &lt; 0.001)]. Increasing phospho-ACC, as a representative downstream target regulated by AMPK, was apparent over a lower range (minimum effective dose, 31 microm; maximum effect, 250 microm; P &lt; 0.001). A level of metformin (125 microm) insufficient for the stimulation of lactate output when used alone potentiated the effects of suboptimal doses of insulin on lactate production. Adiponectin (2.5 microg/ml) had a small but significant effect on lactate output. Metformin activates AMPK in GCs, stimulating lactate production and increasing phospho-ACC. Metformin also enhances the action of suboptimal insulin concentrations to stimulate lactate production.",

    "abstract": "Excessive physical activity is commonly described as symptom of Anorexia Nervosa (AN). Activity-based anorexia (ABA) is considered an animal model for AN. The ABA model mimics severe body weight loss and increased physical activity. Suppression of hyperactivity by olanzapine in anorectic patients as well as in ABA rats suggested a role of dopamine and/or serotonin in this trait. Here, we investigated the effect of a non-selective dopamine antagonist in the ABA model. A dose-response curve of chronic treatment with the non-selective dopaminergic antagonist cis-flupenthixol was determined in the ABA model. Treatment reduced activity levels in both ad libitum fed and food-restricted rats. Treated ABA rats reduced body weight loss and increased food intake. These data support a role for dopamine in anorexia associated hyperactivity. Interestingly, in contrast to leptin treatment, food-anticipatory activity still persists in treated ABA rats.",

    "abstract": "Obesity, currently associated with metabolic syndrome is characterized by an excessive fat storage in different organs, in particular adipose tissue, inducing the loss of its structural and functional integrity. Being aware of the importance of adipose tissue endocrine function and the key role of adipocytokines, such as adiponectin, in obesity and metabolic syndrome drives the necessity to develop new drugs that can exert a specific action on adipose tissue and on adiponectin levels. Rimonabant, an antiobesity drug, presents a dual effect by decreasing food intake and importantly increasing adiponectin. This review focuses on the key role of adiponectin regulation in the success of rimonabant and suggests that this adipohormone may be considered as a therapeutic target to design innovative and promising antiobesity and anti-metabolic syndrome drugs.",

    "abstract": "The sympathetic nervous system is activated in human obesity and in the analogous experimental obesity produced by overfeeding. The causes remain uncertain and may be multiple. The consequences include hypertension, probably attributable to activation of the sympathetic outflow to the kidneys, and, more disputed, insulin resistance. The pattern of sympathetic activation in normal-weight and obesity-related hypertension differs in terms of the firing characteristics of individual sympathetic fibers (increased rate of nerve firing in normal-weight hypertensives, increased number of active fibers firing at a normal rate in obesity-hypertension) and the sympathetic outflows involved. The underlying mechanisms and the adverse consequences of the two modes of sympathetic activation may differ. Should antihypertensive drug therapy in obesity-hypertension specifically target the existing neural pathophysiology? Such an approach can be advocated on theoretical grounds. Perhaps more important is the requirement that chosen antihypertensives do not cause weight gain or insulin resistance.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin is an important vascular protective substance whose levels are reduced in states of insulin resistance. The relationships between plasma insulin levels and adiponectin are not fully understood, and it is not known whether it is the elevated circulating levels of insulin or insulin resistance that directly affects adiponectin levels. The present study evaluates the direct effect of chronic hyperinsulinemia on plasma adiponectin levels. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with insulin (n=15) administered by a sustained-release implant or were given a sham implantation (n=10) as a control group. Body weight, systolic blood pressure, plasma glucose, triglycerides, insulin, and adiponectin were measured at baseline and after 20 and 40 d of treatment. Insulin-treated rats and controls showed a similar increase in body weight. The insulin-treated group had a significant increase in plasma insulin levels and a decrease in plasma glucose levels compared with the sham group, with no change in blood pressure or triglyceride levels. Adiponectin levels remained unchanged despite the significant increase in insulin levels. High circulating insulin levels do not affect plasma adiponectin levels. These results support the concept that the primary defect that results in insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia is responsible for the altered plasma adiponectin levels in the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Adipocyte dysfunction is strongly associated with the development of obesity, which is a major risk factor for many disorders including diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease. It is generally accepted that the regulation of adipogenesis or adipokines expression prevents obesity. In this study, we show that isorhamnetin inhibits adipocyte differentiation, as evidenced by reduced triglyceride (TG) accumulation and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activity. At the molecular level, the mRNA expression levels of peroxidase proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha (C/EBP-alpha), which are the major adipogenic transcription factors, were markedly reduced by isorhamnetin. However, the mRNA levels of C/EBP-beta and -delta, the upstream regulators of PPAR-gamma and C/EBP-alpha, were not reduced by isorhamnetin. Moreover, the mRNA levels of PPAR-gamma target genes such as lipoprotein lipase (LPL), CD36, aP2, and liver X receptor-alpha (LXR-alpha) were downregulated by isorhamnetin. We also showed that isorhamnetin inhibits the expression and secretion of adiponectin, and the results of adiponectin promoter assays suggest the inhibition of PPAR-gamma expression as a possible mechanism underlying the isorhamnetin-mediated effects. Taken together, these results indicate that isorhamnetin inhibits adipogenesis through downregulation of PPAR-gamma and C/EBP-alpha.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin plays important roles in the control of energy homeostasis and autonomic function through peripheral and central nervous system actions. The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus is a primary site of neuroendocrine (NE) and autonomic integration, and, thus, a potential target for adiponectin actions. Here, we investigate actions of adiponectin on parvocellular PVN neurons. Adiponectin influenced the majority (65%) of parvocellular PVN neurons, depolarizing 47%, whereas hyperpolarizing 18% of neurons tested. Post hoc identification (single-cell RT-PCR) after recordings revealed that adiponectin depolarizes NE-CRH neurons, whereas intracerebroventricular injections of adiponectin in vivo caused increased plasma ACTH concentrations. Adiponectin also depolarized the majority of TRH neurons, however, NE-TRH neurons were unaffected, in accordance with in vivo experiments showing that intracerebroventricular adiponectin was without effect on plasma TSH. In addition, bath administration of adiponectin also depolarized both preautonomic TRH and oxytocin neurons. These results show that adiponectin acts in the central nervous system to coordinate NE and autonomic function through actions on specific functional groups of PVN neurons.",

Leptin and prolactin enhanced proliferation (thymidine incorporation) of the mammary gland cells, elevated the cells' proliferation in a dose-responsive manner, and synergized to elevate the expression of amino acid metabolism via a 90% increase in aminopeptidase N expression. Leptin and prolactin decreased apoptosis (decreased caspase-3 expression by 60%) in the same manner. Leptin enhanced the effect of prolactin on all of these processes in bovine mammary explants. Leptin and prolactin regulated mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) by increasing expression by 66%, which is one of the signal-transduction junctions involved in the regulation of proliferation, apoptosis, and protein synthesis. These findings support the hypothesis that leptin up-regulates prolactin action in the bovine mammary gland.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived protein that acts to reduce insulin resistance in the liver and muscle and also inhibits atherosclerosis. Although adiponectin reportedly enhances AMP-activated protein kinase and inhibits tumor necrosis factor-alpha action downstream from the adiponectin signal, the precise physiological mechanisms by which adiponectin acts on skeletal muscles remain unknown. We treated murine primary skeletal muscle cells with recombinant full-length human adiponectin for 12 h and searched, using two-dimensional electrophoresis, for proteins upregulated more than threefold by adiponectin compared with untreated cells. We found one protein that was increased 6.3-fold with adiponectin incubation. MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-top of flight) mass spectrometric analysis identified this protein as ferritin heavy chain (FHC). When murine primary skeletal muscle cells were treated with adiponectin, IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation was observed, suggesting that adiponectin stimulates nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activity. In addition, FHC upregulation by adiponectin was inhibited by NF-kappaB inhibitors. These results suggest NF-kappaB activation to be involved in FHC upregulation by adiponectin. Other NF-kappaB target genes, manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), were also increased by adiponectin treatment. We performed a reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay using CM-H(2)DCFDA fluorescence and found that ROS-reducing effects of adiponectin were abrogated by FHC or MnSOD small-interfering RNA induction. We have demonstrated that adiponectin upregulates FHC in murine skeletal muscle tissues, suggesting that FHC elevation might partially explain how adiponectin protects against oxidative stress in skeletal muscles.",

An open-label, randomized, prospective clinical trial in 40 hypogonadal men (baseline serum testosterone levels &lt;5 nmol/l), randomly assigned to 250 mg TE/3 weeks (no.=20) or 1000 mg TU im every 6 to 9 weeks for 30 weeks (no.=20). Subsequently, 32/40 men continued the study for another 114 weeks, now receiving TU 1000 mg/12 weeks. TU and TE produced no statistically significant improvements in grip strength over the first 30 weeks, which only occurred after approximately 90 weeks when all subjects received TU. There were no changes in body mass index with TU and TE, neither in the follow-up period when all patients received TU. But ratios of waist to hip circumferences declined in the longer term. Total serum cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides declined over the first 30 weeks, while plasma HDL also declined. Plasma LDL decreased further under long-term TU therapy, while HDL then increased. Hemoglobin and hematocrit values significantly increased over the first 30 weeks in both treatment groups and then no further increase was observed. Levels did not exceed the upper limit of normal. In both treatment groups, serum prostate specific antigen levels rose slightly after 30 weeks, with no further increase over the first 12 months, remaining stable within the normal range. Plasma T before the following TU injection was above the lower limit of reference values. Four injections per year are adequate. Administration of TU every 12 weeks is at least as safe and efficacious for treatment of hypogonadal men as TE, with a substantially lower frequency of administration. Follow-up over 114 weeks, when all subjects received TU, showed an excellent profile of efficacy and safety.",

    "title": "A randomized, controlled trial of the effects of rosiglitazone on adipokines, and inflammatory and fibrinolytic markers in diabetic patients: study design and protocol.",
    "abstract": "Although rosiglitazone may offer vascular benefits beyond lowering glucose, recently, concern has been raised that this drug may paradoxically increase cardiovascular risk. To assess the effects of rosiglitazone compared with standard oral hypoglycemic therapies on adipokines, and inflammatory and fibrinolytic markers in subjects with type 2 diabetes. A 12-week, randomized, open-label, parallel-group study will be conducted on 100 type 2 diabetic subjects with suboptimal glycemic control (glycosylated hemoglobin 0.075 or greater) despite management with lifestyle alone (drug-naive) or with monotherapy (either metformin or sulfonylurea). Drug-naive patients will be randomly assigned to receive either rosiglitazone (4 mg/day to 8 mg/day) or metformin (500 mg/day to 2000 mg/day). Patients on pre-existing monotherapy will be randomly assigned to the addition of rosiglitazone (4 mg/day to 8 mg/day), or to either metformin (500 mg/day to 2000 mg/day) or glyburide (5 mg/day to 20 mg/day) (depending on background treatment). The primary end point of the study is the change in adiponectin level (from baseline to 12 weeks) in the rosiglitazone versus metformin or sulfonylurea arms. Secondary end points include changes in leptin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, matrix metalloproteinase-9, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, insulin sensitivity, glycosylated hemoglobin and lipid levels. Additionally, all patients will be required to be treated with an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system, namely an angiotensin receptor antagonist, as per national diabetes treatment guidelines, to a target systolic blood pressure of less than 130 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure of less than 80 mmHg, or for the optimal suppression of microalbuminuria. M&#xea;me si la rosiglitazone peut comporter des bienfaits vasculaires en plus de r&#xe9;duire la glyc&#xe9;mie, on s&#x2019;est r&#xe9;cemment inqui&#xe9;t&#xe9; du fait que ce m&#xe9;dicament pourrait paradoxalement accro&#xee;tre le risque cardiovasculaire. &#xc9;valuer les effets de la rosiglitazone par rapport &#xe0; des th&#xe9;rapies hypoglyc&#xe9;miques orales standard sur les adipokines, et les marqueurs inflammatoires et fibrinolytiques chez des personnes atteintes de diab&#xe8;te de type 2. Les auteurs effectueront une &#xe9;tude al&#xe9;atoire ouverte de 12 semaines aupr&#xe8;s de groupes parall&#xe8;les de 100 diab&#xe9;tiques de type 2 dont le contr&#xf4;le glyc&#xe9;mique est sous-optimal (h&#xe9;moglobine glycosyl&#xe9;e de 0,75 ou plus) malgr&#xe9; une prise en charge par le mode de vie seulement (pas de m&#xe9;dicaments) ou par une monoth&#xe9;rapie (metformine ou sulfonylur&#xe9;e). Les patients qui ne prenaient pas de m&#xe9;dicaments seront r&#xe9;partis au hasard entre un traitement &#xe0; la rosiglitazone (4 mg/jour &#xe0; 8 mg/jour) ou &#xe0; la metformine (500 mg/jour &#xe0; 2 000 mg/jour). Les patients d&#xe9;j&#xe0; sous monoth&#xe9;rapie seront r&#xe9;partis au hasard entre l&#x2019;ajout de rosiglitazone (4 mg/jour &#xe0; 8 mg/jour) ou soit de metformine (500 mg/jour &#xe0; 2 000 mg/jour), soit de glyburide (5 mg/jour &#xe0; 20 mg/jour) (selon le traitement de fond). Le point de virage primaire de l&#x2019;&#xe9;tude correspond au changement du taux d&#x2019;adiponectine (du d&#xe9;but jusqu&#x2019;&#xe0; 12 semaines) dans les branches de rosiglitazone par rapport &#xe0; celles de metformine ou de sylfonur&#xe9;e. Les points de virage secondaires incluent des changements aux taux de leptine, de prot&#xe9;ine C r&#xe9;active de haute sensibilit&#xe9;, d&#x2019;interleukine-6, de facteur de n&#xe9;crose tumorale alpha, de matrice m&#xe9;talloprot&#xe9;inase-9, des mol&#xe9;cules d&#x2019;adh&#xe9;sion des cellules vasculaires 1, de l&#x2019;inhibiteur de l&#x2019;activateur du plastimog&#xe8;ne de type 1, de la sensibilit&#xe9; &#xe0; l&#x2019;insuline, de h&#xe9;moglobine glycosyl&#xe9;e et de lipides. De plus, tous les patients devront recevoir un inhibiteur du syst&#xe8;me r&#xe9;nine-angiotensine, soit un antagoniste des r&#xe9;cepteurs de l&#x2019;angiotensine, conform&#xe9;ment aux lignes directrices nationales sur le traitement du diab&#xe8;te, afin de cibler une tension systolique inf&#xe9;rieure &#xe0; 130 mmHg et une tension diastolique inf&#xe9;rieure &#xe0; 80 mmHg, ou d&#x2019;assurer la suppression optimale des microalbuminuries.

    "abstract": "The correlation between well-established biological parameters of prognostic relevance in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) [i.e., mutational status of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IgV(H)), ZAP-70- and CD38-expression] and adiponectin serum concentration was evaluated in a cohort of 69 previously untreated Binet stage A CLL patients. Adiponectin levels inversely correlated with absolute peripheral blood lymphocyte count (r = -0.254; P = 0.03), CD38-positive CLL cells (r = -0.294; P = 0.04) and ZAP-70 (r = -0.285; P = 0.03). The univariate Cox proportional hazard model demonstrated that, in addition with lower serum levels of adiponectin (P = 0.01), the unmutated IgV(H) condition (P = 0.002) and ZAP-70-positivity (P = 0.02) were associated with a shorter time to first treatment (TFT). However, in multivariate analysis only ZAP-70 positivity emerged as predictor of the TFT (P = 0.008). The levels of adiponectin in CLL were evaluated in 60 patients from an independent cohort investigated by gene expression profiling. Adiponectin gene expression was invariably low suggesting a limited (if any) role of leukemic cells in the production of circulating adiponectin levels. In contrast, both adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) and AdipoR2 mRNA were highly expressed by CLL cells with a degree of inter-patient variability. Our results, although preliminary, lend support to the idea that adiponectin secretion by bone marrow adipocytes might represent a possible promising drug target in the field of hematology.",

    "title": "Central leptin regulates total ceramide content and sterol regulatory element binding protein-1C proteolytic maturation in rat white adipose tissue.",
    "abstract": "Obesity and type 2 diabetes are associated with insulin and leptin resistance, and increased ceramide contents in target tissues. Because the adipose tissue has become a central focus in these diseases, and leptin-induced increases in insulin sensitivity may be related to effects of leptin on lipid metabolism, we investigated herein whether central leptin was able to regulate total ceramide levels and the expression of enzymes involved in ceramide metabolism in rat white adipose tissue (WAT). After 7 d central leptin treatment, the total content of ceramides was analyzed by quantitative shotgun lipidomics mass spectrometry. The effects of leptin on the expression of several enzymes of the sphingolipid metabolism, sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-1c, and insulin-induced gene 1 (INSIG-1) in this tissue were studied. Total ceramide levels were also determined after surgical WAT denervation. Central leptin infusion significantly decreased both total ceramide content and the long-chain fatty acid ceramide species in WAT. Concomitant with these results, leptin decreased the mRNA levels of enzymes involved in de novo ceramide synthesis (SPT-1, LASS2, LASS4) and ceramide production from sphingomyelin (SMPD-1/2). The mRNA levels of enzymes of ceramide degradation (Asah1/2) and utilization (sphingomyelin synthase, ceramide kinase, glycosyl-ceramide synthase, GM3 synthase) were also down-regulated. Ceramide-lowering effects of central leptin were prevented by local autonomic nervous system denervation of WAT. Finally, central leptin treatment markedly increased INSIG-1 mRNA expression and impaired SREBP-1c activation in epididymal WAT. These observations indicate that in vivo central leptin, acting through the autonomic nervous system, regulates total ceramide levels and SREBP-1c proteolytic maturation in WAT, probably contributing to improve the overall insulin sensitivity.",

    "title": "NGF gene expression and secretion by canine adipocytes in primary culture: upregulation by the inflammatory mediators LPS and TNFalpha.",
    "abstract": "Obesity is the commonest nutritional disorder of companion animals. In rodents and humans, white adipose tissue is a major endocrine and secretory organ, releasing adipokines linked to inflammation. In this study, we examined whether nerve growth factor (NGF), a target-derived neurotrophin central to the development/maintenance of sympathetic innervation and an inflammatory response protein, is synthesized and secreted by canine adipocytes. NGF mRNA was detected in each of the major fat depots (the subcutaneous, inguinal, gonadal, perirenal, and falciform ligaments) of dogs at similar levels. Canine adipocytes, differentiated from preadipocytes (inguinal depot) in primary culture, expressed the NGF gene and secreted NGF both pre- and post-differentiation. Treatment of the differentiated adipocytes with LPS resulted in a dramatic increase in NGF mRNA levels (20-fold at 24 h) and in NGF protein in the medium (60-fold at 24 h). The proinflammatory cytokine TNFalpha also led to a substantial increase in NGF mRNA levels (11-fold) and protein secretion (16-fold), while IL-6 had little effect. In contrast, dexamethasone decreased both NGF mRNA levels (80%) and protein release (60%). The PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone also reduced NGF secretion. These results demonstrate that canine white adipocytes synthesize and secrete NGF, the powerful upregulation by LPS and TNFalpha indicating that the neurotrophin is strongly linked to the inflammatory response in canine WAT. Canine adipocytes appear highly sensitive to inflammatory stimuli.",

    "title": "Resistin inhibits essential functions of polymorphonuclear leukocytes.",
    "abstract": "The serum levels of resistin, a 12-kDa protein primarily expressed in inflammatory cells in humans, are increased in patients with chronic kidney disease and in those with diabetes mellitus. Both groups of patients have an increased risk of infections mainly as a result of disturbed polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL) functions. Therefore, we investigated the influence of resistin on human PMNLs. Serum resistin concentrations were determined with a sandwich enzyme immunoassay. Using PMNLs from healthy subjects, chemotaxis was tested by the under-agarose method. Flow cytometric assays to measure oxidative burst and phagocytosis were conducted in whole blood. The uptake of deoxyglucose was determined as measure of the PMNL activation state. The activity of intracellular kinases was assessed by Western blotting and by in vitro kinase assays. Resistin inhibited PMNL chemotaxis and decreased the oxidative burst stimulated by Escherichia coli and by PMA, but did not influence PMNL phagocytosis of opsonized E. coli and PMNL glucose uptake. The inhibition of PMNLs by resistin was observed at concentrations found in serum samples of uremic patients, but not in concentrations measured in healthy subjects. Experiments with specific signal transduction inhibitors and measurements of intracellular kinases suggest that PI3K is a major target of resistin. In conclusion, resistin interferes with the chemotactic movement and the stimulation of the oxidative burst of PMNL, and therefore may contribute to the disturbed immune response in patients with increased resistin serum levels such as uremic and diabetic subjects.",

    "abstract": "Visfatin is an adipocytokine that improves insulin resistance and has an antidiabetic effect. However, the role of visfatin in the kidney has not yet been reported. In this experiment, the synthesis and physiological action of visfatin in cultured mesangial cells (MCs) were studied to investigate the role of visfatin in diabetic nephropathy. Visfatin was found synthesized in MCs as well as adipocytes. Visfatin synthesis was markedly increased, not by angiotensin II, but by high glucose stimuli. In addition, visfatin treatment induced a rapid uptake of glucose, peaking at 20 min after visfatin treatment in a dose-dependent manner. A small inhibiting RNA against insulin receptor significantly blocked visfatin-mediated glucose uptake. Visfatin stimuli also enhanced intracellular NAD levels, and treatment with FK866, which is a specific inhibitor of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt), significantly inhibited visfatin-induced NAD synthesis and glucose uptake. Visfatin treatment increased glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) protein expression in isolated cellular membranes, and pretreatment with cytochalasin B completely inhibited visfatin-induced glucose uptake. Moreover, immunofluorescent microscopy showed the migration of cytosolic GLUT-1 into cellular membranes after visfatin treatment. In accordance with these results, the activation of protein kinase B was detected after visfatin treatment. Furthermore, visfatin treatment dramatically increased the synthesis of profibrotic molecules including transforming growth factor-beta1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and type I collagen, and pretreatment with cytochalasin B completely inhibited visfatin-induced upregulation of profibrotic molecules. These results suggest that visfatin is produced in MCs, which are a novel target for visfatin, and play an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy.",

    "title": "Role of hypothalamic AMP-kinase in food intake regulation.",
    "abstract": "Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) functions as a cellular fuel gauge that regulates metabolic pathways in nutrient metabolism. Recent studies have strongly implicated that AMPK in the hypothalamus regulates energy metabolism by integrating inputs from multiple hormones, peptides, neurotransmitters, and nutrients. Leptin is an adipocyte hormone that regulates food intake and energy expenditure in peripheral tissues. Leptin inhibits AMPK activity in the arcuate and paraventricular hypothalamus, and its inhibition is necessary for the anorexic effect of leptin. Alteration of hypothalamic AMPK activity is sufficient to change food intake and body weight. Furthermore, fasting/refeeding, glucose, and melanocortin receptor alter AMPK activity in the hypothalamus. Adiponectin has also been shown to increase food intake by activating AMPK in the arcuate hypothalamus. Recent data have shown that acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase/malonyl-coenzyme A/carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1/fatty acid oxidation and mammalian target of rapamycin signalings are putative downstream pathways for food intake regulation in response to hypothalamic AMPK. Thus, these results suggest that food intake and nutrient metabolism are coordinately regulated by the common signaling pathway of AMPK in the hypothalamus.",

    "title": "Functional potentiation of leptin-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 signaling by the androgen receptor.",
    "abstract": "Hypogonadism is associated with increased fat mass and dysregulation of metabolic homeostasis in men. Our previous study revealed that androgen receptor (AR)-null male mice (ARL-/Y) develop late-onset obesity and are leptin-resistant. The present study evaluated how hypothalamic AR contributes to central leptin-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling. We evaluated leptin action in wild-type and ARL-/Y mice, the anatomic co-relationship between AR and leptin signaling in the hypothalamus, and the effects of AR on leptin-mediated STAT3 transactivation and nuclear translocation. AR deletion in male mice results in a weaker leptin-induced suppression of food intake and body weight drop even before the onset of overt obesity. In wild-type male but not female mice, AR was highly expressed in various hypothalamic nuclei that also expressed the long-form leptin receptor (OBRB) and co-resided with OBRB directly in the arcuate neurons. In vitro, AR significantly enhanced STAT3-mediated transcription of leptin target genes including POMC and SOCS3. This effect relied on the AR N-terminal activation function-1 (AF-1) domain and was specific to AR in that none of the other sex steroid hormone receptors tested showed similar effects. AR enhanced the low concentrations of leptin-induced STAT3 nuclear translocation in vitro, and ARL-/Y mice receiving leptin had impaired STAT3 nuclear localization in the arcuate neurons. These findings indicate that AR in the hypothalamus functions as a regulator of central leptin-OBRB-STAT3 signaling and has a physiological role in energy homeostasis and metabolic regulation in male mice.",

    "abstract": "High-molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin may have the most biologic activity among several isoforms. We investigated long-term effects of losartan on serum concentrations of total and HMW adiponectin in hypertensive patients with metabolic syndrome (MS) by serial measurements over 6 months. Forty hypertensive patients first received 50 mg of losartan. Upward titration of the losartan dose was implemented to reach a target blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg. Serum total adiponectin and HMW adiponectin were measured at study entry (baseline), the 3-month treatment time point, and the end of the 6-month period. Non-HMW adiponectin (ie, medium- and low-molecular weight adiponectin) was calculated as total adiponectin--HMW adiponectin. Diagnosis of MS was done by current standard criteria. In hypertensive patients without MS (n = 21), the serum total adiponectin increased from 9.8 +/- 5.4 microg/mL at baseline to 11.1 +/- 6.2 microg/mL at 6 months (P &lt; .01). Furthermore, the serum total adiponectin was significantly higher at 6 months than at 3 months (P &lt; .01). Serum HMW adiponectin also increased from 5.7 +/- 3.9 microg/mL at baseline to 6.6 +/- 4.4 microg/mL at 6 months (P &lt; .01). In hypertensive patients with MS, the serum total adiponectin increased from 6.0 +/- 2.7 mug/mL at baseline to 6.7 +/- 3.3 microg/mL at 3 months and to 7.0 +/- 3.1 microg/mL at 6 months (P &lt; .01 for both). Furthermore, the serum HMW adiponectin concentration was significantly higher at 6 months than at 3 months (P &lt; .001). However, the serum non-HMW adiponectin concentration did not change during treatment in either group. In conclusion, serum total and HMW adiponectin concentrations increase after 6 months of losartan treatment in hypertensive patients, irrespective of the presence or absence of MS.",

    "abstract": "The high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mouse is a model of obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, and insulin resistance. The main objective of this study was to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the antidiabetogenic and weight-lowering effects of 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) in this mouse model. C57BL/6 female mice (8 wk old) were fed on a HFD for 10 mo. E(2), given daily (50 microg/kg s.c.) during the last month of feeding, decreased body weight and markedly improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Plasma levels of insulin, leptin, resistin, and adiponectin were decreased. We demonstrated that E(2) treatment decreased the expression of genes encoding resistin and leptin in white adipose tissue (WAT), whereas adiponectin expression was unchanged. Furthermore, in WAT we demonstrated decreased expression levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and its lipogenic target genes, such as fatty acid synthase and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1). In the liver, the expression levels of transcription factors such as liver X receptor alpha and SREBP1c were not changed by E(2) treatment, but the expression of the key lipogenic gene SCD1 was reduced. This was accompanied by decreased hepatic triglyceride content. Importantly, E(2) decreased the hepatic expression of glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase). We conclude that E(2) treatment exerts antidiabetic and antiobesity effects in HFD mice and suggest that this is related to decreased expression of lipogenic genes in WAT and liver and suppression of hepatic expression of G-6-Pase. Decreased plasma levels of resistin probably also play an important role in this context.",

    "abstract": "Gyeongshingangjeehwan (GGEx), which comprises Liriope platyphylla F.T. Wang &amp; T. Tang (Liliaceae), Platycodongrandiflorum A. DC. (Campanulaceae), Schisandrachinensis K. Koch (Magnoliaceae), and Ephedra sinica Stapf (Ephedraceae), has traditionally been used as an anti-obesity drug in Korean local clinics, although there is no evidence concerning the scientific analyses of its effects and mechanism(s) of action. Thus, we investigated the effects of GGEx on obesity, as well as the mechanism by which GGEx functions, in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) male rats. Compared with obese OLETF control rats, administration of GGEx for 8 weeks significantly decreased food intake and plasma leptin levels as well as body weight gain and abdominal fat in OLETF rats. GGEx treatment not only decreased circulating triglycerides, but also inhibited lipid accumulation in the liver. GGEx increased the hepatic mRNA levels of PPARalpha target genes responsible for fatty acid beta-oxidation. Consistent with the in vivo data, GGEx elevated PPARalpha reporter gene expression in NMu2Li liver cells. These results suggest that GGEx may effectively prevent obesity and hypertriglyceridemia in part through the inhibition of feeding and the activation of hepatic PPARalpha.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac hypertrophy is common in diabetes and an independent risk factor for cardiac morbidity and mortality. We investigated the effects of pioglitazone on cardiac hypertrophy and hypertrophic signaling in Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive rats. Dahl salt-sensitive rats were fed a high-salt diet from 7 weeks of age and treated with pioglitazone (2.5 mg/kg per day) or vehicle from 7 to 11 weeks. The vehicle-treated rats developed left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis as well as left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The serum level of adiponectin and the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase in the myocardium did not differ between the vehicle-treated rats and control rats maintained on a normal diet. The phosphorylation of Akt, mammalian target of rapamycin, and p70S6 kinase as well as the total protein content were increased in the heart of vehicle-treated rats compared with control rats, and these changes were blocked by treatment with pioglitazone. Pioglitazone treatment also ameliorated left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis, improved diastolic function, and increased both the serum adiponectin concentration and the level of AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation in the heart. Long-term administration of pioglitazone attenuated left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis as well as inhibited phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin and p70S6 kinase in the heart of hypertensive rats. The beneficial cardiac effects of pioglitazone are likely attributable, at least partly, both to the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase signaling through stimulation of adiponectin secretion and to the inhibition of Akt signaling.",

    "abstract": "Hyperglycemia causes endothelial dysfunction due to its effect on increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS). Adiponectin (Adp) has been reported to suppress hyperglycemia-associated ROS generation. It was hypothesized that administering globular adiponectin (gAdp) via injectable biodegradable thermosensitive triblock copolymer might effectively reduce ROS generation in endothelial cells. In this study, gAdp was incorporated into and released from the polymer gel. The released gAdp was further investigated by comparing it with the intact gAdp with regard to the efficiency in reducing ROS and activating cAMP. The released gAdp effectively suppressed excess ROS production in the in vitro endothelial cell culture model under high-glucose condition via cAMP/PKA pathway. These data provide a rationale for developing controlled release dosage form of gAdp as a therapeutic tool for oxidative stress-related pathology in patients with diabetes.",

    "title": "The role of hypothalamic mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 signaling in diet-induced obesity.",
    "abstract": "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase is a key regulator of several cellular functions, including cell growth and differentiation. Because hypothalamic mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling has been implicated as a target of leptin in the regulation of energy balance, we investigated its role in obesity-induced leptin resistance. In contrast to rats maintained on a low-fat (LF) diet for 3 weeks, rats maintained on a high-fat (HF)-diet had no anorexic response to intracerebroventricular leptin. Western blot analysis revealed that leptin was unable to modulate hypothalamic mTORC1 signaling in the HF group, whereas it significantly induced phosphorylation of both S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and S6 ribosomal protein (S6) in the LF group. Similar to leptin, the cytokine ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) induces hypophagia and increases signal transduction activator of transcription 3 phosphorylation. However, CNTF and its analog CNTF(Ax15) activate leptin-like pathways in the hypothalamus, even in leptin-resistant states, including diet-induced obesity. Intracerebroventricular CNTF(Ax15) decreased 24 h food intake and body weight in rats on HF or LF diets and increased the phosphorylation of hypothalamic S6K1 and S6 in a comparable way in both diets. Importantly, mice lacking the expression of S6K1 (S6K1(-/-)) did not respond to the anorectic action of either leptin or CNTF(Ax15), implying a crucial role for S6K1 in modulating the actions of these two cytokines. Finally, exposure to HF diet decreased mTORC1 signaling within the hypothalamus. Overall, these findings point strongly to the possibility that reduced hypothalamic mTORC1 signaling contributes to the development of hyperphagia, weight gain, and leptin resistance during diet-induced obesity.",

    "abstract": "G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise the largest and most diverse family of membrane receptors in the human genome, relaying information from a vast array of external stimuli. GPCRs are targets for approximately 30% of all current therapeutic agents. Recently some GPCRs have been shown to mediate part of their effects through activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a sensor of whole body energy status that plays a pivotal role in whole body energy balance by integrating signals in the periphery and central nervous system. It regulates glucose and lipid metabolism, food intake and body weight, making it an attractive target for the treatment of diseases such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. It mediates the effects of several important adipokines such as leptin and adiponectin and is thought to be responsible for the antidiabetic effects of metformin and thiazolidinediones. A diverse number of GPCRs (including adrenoceptors, cannabinoid receptors, ghrelin receptors, melanocortin receptors) modulate AMPK activity. This review focuses on the regulation of AMPK by GPCRs and signaling intermediates of GPCR signaling such as cyclic AMP and calcium, and how GPCR signaling can modulate AMPK activity by several different mechanisms, and the therapeutic implications of AMPK activation by GPCRs.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to identify mechanisms through which valproic acid (VPA) causes weight gain. Healthy participants (N = 52) were randomized to VPA or placebo in a double-blind study. Energy intake (EI) was measured in the laboratory at lunch and dinner, and physical activity (PA) was measured with accelerometry. Glucose levels and hormones [Peptide YY(3-36), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), leptin, ghrelin, insulin] that regulate EI were measured. Assessments occurred at baseline and week 3. Change from baseline was evaluated with mixed models (alpha = 0.05). Weight significantly increased in the VPA group (+0.49 kg), but not the placebo group. The VPA group increased fast food fats cravings and decreased glucose levels compared with placebo. Change in weight, EI and PA did not differ by group. Within group analyses indicated that the VPA group increased PA, hunger, binge eating, depression and GLP-1. VPA-associated weight gain is not likely due to changes in PA or the gut hormones studied. Although EI did not increase when measured after 3 weeks of treatment, VPA decreased glucose levels and increased motivation to eat; hence, EI might have increased in the short-term. Research testing VPA on short-term (1 week) EI, metabolism, and substrate partitioning is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Leptin plays a critical role in regulating body weight, lipid metabolism, apoptosis and microvasculature of adipose tissue. To explore multiple signaling pathways of leptin action on adipose tissue, real-time PCR utilizing TaqMan low-density arrays was performed to compare mRNA expression in adipose tissue of ob/ob mice treated with vehicle or leptin (2.5 microg/d or 10 microg/d) for 14 days via subcutaneous osmotic minipumps. Of the 24 target genes selected for characterization, many were differentially expressed between control ob/ob mice and leptin-treated ob/ob mice. Increases in mRNA expression were found for hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), adrenergic receptor 3 (ADR3), mitofusin 2 (Mfn2), sirtuin 3 (Sirt3), transcription factor sterol regulatory element binding factor 1 (SREBF1), Bcl-2, Bax, Caspase 3, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), adiponectin and angiopoietin 2 (Ang-2). Decreases in expression were found for stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD1), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4). There were no changes in expression of transcription factors involved in adipocyte differentiation (C/EBPalpha, PPARalpha, and PPARgamma). These results confirm that alterations in the expression of specific adipose tissue genes including those associated with the promotion of lipid mobilization, energy dissipation, and apoptosis may mediate leptin-induced fat loss in ob/ob mice.",

    "abstract": "Ischemic cardiovascular events represent the leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, and platelet aggregation and thrombus formation are the main effectors of acute arterial ischemic events. Although antiplatelet therapy is the cornerstone of antithrombotic treatment of ischemic cardiovascular disorders, available antiplatelet agents have less than satisfactory efficacy; thus, the identification of novel potential target candidates for antiplatelet therapy is highly warranted. Recent evidence suggests that several molecules that amplify the aggregation response of platelets to activating stimuli, which are either released by platelets (potentiating molecules) or present in the milieu before platelets get activated (primers), play a major role in pathologic thrombus formation without being significantly involved in primary haemostasis. These molecules appear to be a particularly appealing novel potential pharmacologic target for antiplatelet therapy. Here, we review the present knowledge on some molecules acting as potentiators or primers of platelet activation and discuss their possible pharmacologic modulation for antithrombotic purposes.",

    "abstract": "Evidence suggests that the adipocyte-derived hormone resistin (RSTN) directly regulates both feeding and peripheral metabolism through, so far, undefined hypothalamic-mediated mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that the anorectic effect of RSTN is associated with inappropriately decreased mRNA expression of orexigenic (agouti-related protein and neuropeptide Y) and increased mRNA expression of anorexigenic (cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript) neuropeptides in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. Of interest, RSTN also exerts a profound nutrition-dependent inhibitory effect on hypothalamic fatty acid metabolism, as indicated by increased phosphorylation levels of both AMP-activated protein kinase and its downstream target acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase, associated with decreased expression of fatty acid synthase in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus. In addition, we also demonstrate that chronic central RSTN infusion results in decreased body weight and major changes in peripheral expression of lipogenic enzymes, in a tissue-specific and nutrition-dependent manner. Thus, in the fed state central RSTN is associated with induced expression of fatty acid synthesis enzymes and proinflammatory cytokines in liver, whereas its administration in the fasted state does so in white adipose tissue. Overall, our results indicate that RSTN controls feeding and peripheral lipid metabolism and suggest that hepatic RSTN-induced insulin resistance may be mediated by central activation of de novo lipogenesis in liver.",

Published peer-reviewed literature and abstracts concerning NAFLD and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) were reviewed. Articles specifically related to epidemiology, diagnosis and current treatment strategies for NAFLD and NASH are summarized. NAFLD is strongly associated with the epidemic of obesity and type-2 diabetes mellitus, and is estimated to affect about 20-30% of the population in the US. From the spectrum of NAFLD, only patients with biopsy-proven NASH (estimated prevalence in the US population is about 3-5%) have been convincingly shown to progress to cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. The clinical manifestation of NAFLD is usually absent or subtle, with abnormal aminotransferases or incidental radiographic findings of fatty liver. The pathogenesis of NAFLD is attributed to a multi-hit process involving insulin resistance, oxidative stress, apoptotic pathways, and adipocytokines. In 2008, there is no established treatment for NAFLD. Weight loss and treatment for each component of metabolic syndrome. Nevertheless, a large number of agents are being considered in clinical trials of patients with NASH. Awareness of the tremendous impact of NAFLD as an important cause of chronic liver disease is increasing along with a great deal of information about its pathogenesis. Future, well-designed clinical trials that target specific pathways involved in the pathogenesis of NASH are urgently needed.",

    "abstract": "The adenine monophosphate (AMP) activated protein kinase (AMPK), is a heterotrimeric complex that is activated by an increase in the AMP/ATP ratio, and is considered to be a cellular energy sensor that contributes to regulate energy balance and caloric intake. AMPK is activated by LKB1 hinase and it can phophorylate several enzymes involved in anabolism to prevent further ATP consumption, and induces some catabolic enzymes to increase ATP generation. Furthermore, AMPK regulates the expression of genes involved in lipogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis, among others. AMPK is distributed in most organs including, liver, skeletal muscle, heart and hypothalamus; and even in adipose cells. In addition, AMPK is activated in the hypothalamus stimulating appetite due to energy depletion. AMPK also participates in glycolysis regulation, glucose uptake, lipid oxidation, fatty acid synthesis, cholesterol synthesis and gluconeogenesis, and it has been considered as a possible target enzyme in the treatment of some diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and hepatic steatosis. This review provides a general overview of AMPK structure, its activators and its function in the organism.",

Underlying the concept of cardiometabolic risk is an association with excess visceral fat, leading to the dysregulation of the adipokines, the signalling proteins derived from adipose tissue. Changes in the levels of the adipokines - tumour necrosis factor-alpha, cholesteryl ester transfer protein and adiponectin, for example - can lead to alterations in insulin sensitivity and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol metabolism. At present, specific cardiometabolic risk factors are commonly managed on an individual basis. We are now moving from the era of single risk factor intervention, however, to multiple risk factor intervention in people at high cardiovascular risk, with the additional possibility of using new drug classes to target the underlying cardiometabolic problems more effectively.",

Little is known about the expression and insulin regulation of TTP and related genes in adipocytes. We analyzed the relative abundance of TTP family mRNAs in 3T3-L1 adipocytes compared to RAW264.7 macrophages and investigated insulin effects on the expression of 43 genes in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Insulin was added to mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Relative abundance of mRNA levels was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. TTP and ZFP36L1 proteins were detected by immunoblotting. Zfp36l1 and Zfp36l2 genes were expressed at eight- to tenfold higher than Ttp in adipocytes. Zfp36l3 mRNA was detected at approximately 1% of Ttp mRNA levels in adipocytes and its low level expression was confirmed in RAW cells. Insulin at 10 and 100 nmol/l increased Ttp mRNA levels by five- to sevenfold, but decreased those of Zfp36l3 by 40% in adipocytes after a 30-min treatment. Immunoblotting showed that insulin induced TTP but did not affect ZFP36L1 protein levels in adipocytes. Insulin decreased mRNA levels of Vegf and a number of other genes in adipocytes. Insulin induced Ttp mRNA and protein expression and decreased Vegf mRNA levels in adipocytes. Zfp36l3 mRNA was detected, for the first time, in cells other than mouse placenta and extraembryonic tissues. This study established a basis for the investigation of TTP and VEGF genes in the regulation of obesity and suggested that Vegf mRNA may be a target of TTP in fat cells.",

    "title": "Nescient helix-loop-helix 2 interacts with signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 to regulate transcription of prohormone convertase 1/3.",
    "abstract": "Mechanisms controlling body weight involve gene regulation through the activation of signal transduction pathways. The Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signal transduction pathway is the mechanism primarily used by leptin in the hypothalamus. The transcription factor nescient helix-loop-helix 2 (Nhlh2) is a downstream target of leptin signaling and is expressed in proopiomelanocortin arcuate neurons. Proopiomelanocortin is cleaved by prohormone convertase 1/3 (PC1/3) to produce peptides that regulate the body's response to energy availability. Previous studies show that the PC1/3 promoter contains STAT3 sites mediating leptin-induced PC1/3 expression, and that Nhlh2 is required for hypothalamic PC1/3 expression because Nhlh2 knockout mice have reduced PC1/3 mRNA levels. Studies herein reveal that leptin-induced PC1/3 gene expression is abrogated in N2KO mice, and that in a hypothalamic cell line both STAT3 and Nhlh2 are required for the full transcriptional response of a PC1/3 reporter gene after leptin stimulation. Furthermore, it is shown that Nhlh2 binds to E-box motifs found adjacent to STAT3 sites in the PC1/3 promoter both in vitro and in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Finally, two different protein-protein interaction assays confirm the presence of a STAT3:Nhlh2 heterodimer on the PC1/3 promoter. The Nhlh2:STAT3 heterodimer may be an important transcriptional regulator of other hypothalamic genes in the leptin signaling pathway. These data confirm Nhlh2 as an integral element of the Janus kinase/STAT signaling pathway and are the first to demonstrate coordinated control of PC1/3 transcription by Nhlh2 and STAT3 after leptin stimulation.",

    "title": "Resistance of Janus kinase-2 dependent leptin signaling in natural killer (NK) cells: a novel mechanism of NK cell dysfunction in diet-induced obesity.",
    "abstract": "Leptin acts not only as an anorexigenic hormone but also regulates cell-mediated immunity via leptin receptors (Ob-R) expressed on T and B lymphocytes. However, the impact of leptin on natural killer (NK) cells is currently elusive. We evaluated leptin effects on NK cells in relation to the body weight in rats using in vivo and in vitro approaches. Leptin was injected iv in male lean and diet-induced obese Lewis and F344 rats. NK cell numbers were analyzed in blood and spleen by fluorescence activated cell sorting and immunohistochemistry, and the activity of NK cells was measured by chromium release assay. Ob-R expression was investigated by confocal laser scanning and quantitative RT-PCR. To compare leptin-dependent intracellular signaling under basal and leptin- and tumor cell (MADB106)-stimulated conditions, intracellular target proteins of NK cells were evaluated by Western blotting. Number and distribution pattern of splenic NK cells were significantly different in lean and obese animals. Leptin administration resulted in a 4-fold higher stimulation of the NK activity in lean than obese animals. This was not due to a decreased expression of Ob-R because quantitative RT-PCR revealed significantly higher Ob-Rb mRNA levels in NK cells from obese rats. In contrast, postreceptor signaling is differentially abrogated in obese animals with significantly lower activation of postreceptor signaling components (Janus kinase-2p, protein kinase B pT308, AMPalphapT172) after an in vivo leptin challenge. In conclusion, the results for the first time assign leptin a central role as a modulator of NK cell number and activity only in lean but not obese subjects. The differential role of leptin has important implications for the influence of body weight in the response to systemic inflammations and in the immunological defense of cancer.",

    "abstract": "Hypertension contributes to the occurrence and progression of cardiovascular diseases. The angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker telmisartan is reported to activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and improve insulin sensitivity. We investigated the effects of telmisartan treatment on visceral fat, serum adiponectin and vascular inflammation markers in Japanese hypertensive patients. This was an open-label, non-controlled study. Twenty-eight essential hypertensive patients (22 men and 6 women; age 60.6+/-1.9 years; body mass index [BMI] 25.5+/-0.6 kg/m(2)) participated. Fat area was assessed with computerized tomography. All the subjects were started on telmisartan 40 mg/day, which was increased to 80 mg/day to achieve the blood pressure target of less than 130/80 mmHg. We assessed the visceral and subcutaneous fat areas, serum adiponectin levels, and vascular inflammation markers at baseline and 24 weeks of telmisartan treatment. There were significant reductions in visceral fat area (from 103.1+/-7.9 to 93.3+/-8.4 cm(2), p&lt;0.01) and pulse wave velocity (from 1,706+/-52 to 1,587+/-51 cm/s, p&lt;0.01) at 24 weeks. In contrast, significant increases in serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (from 5.06+/-0.15 to 5.32+/-0.13 mmol/L, p&lt;0.05) and adiponectin levels (from 8.27+/-0.76 to 9.13+/-0.81 microg/mL, p&lt;0.05) were observed. Also, there were reductions in the interleukin-6 level (from 2.26+/-0.27 to 1.60+/-0.14 pg/mL, p&lt;0.01). We also conducted these investigations in male subjects alone and similar findings were obtained for all of these parameters. In conclusion, telmisartan treatment was associated with an improvement of vascular inflammation, reductions in visceral fat and increases in serum adiponectin.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects of leptin on human prostate cancer cells, and the role of related signalling pathways in mediating these actions, as obesity is a possible risk factor for prostate cancer and leptin, an adipocyte-derived hormone, has mitogenic action in various cell types. Two human prostate cancer cell lines, DU145 and PC-3, were treated with leptin (5-100 ng/mL) for up to 48 h. Under serum-free conditions, cell proliferation was measured using a colorimetric tetrazolium assay and apoptosis by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measuring cell death. Also, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt was detected by Western blotting, and specific inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (PD98059; 40 microm) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K, LY294002; 40 microm) were used to evaluate the role of these signalling pathways. Leptin dose-dependently increased the cell number in both cell lines for up to 48 h of incubation, the mean (sem) percentage of the control being 189 (4.3)% for DU145 and 173 (7.5)% for PC-3 (100 ng/mL leptin, 48 h; P &lt; 0.01). Leptin also significantly reduced the number of apoptotic cells after 24 h of treatment, dose-dependently caused ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation; pretreatment with inhibitors of MAPK and PI3-K inhibited these responses. These results show that chronic increases in leptin might enhance the growth of prostate cancer via the MAPK and PI3-K pathways. Further studies are needed to investigate whether the ability of leptin to stimulate mitogenic/anti-apoptotic signal transduction pathways could represent a target for anticancer drug discovery.",

    "title": "[AMPK: a link between metabolism and reproduction?].",
    "abstract": "5'AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a serine/threonine kinase that acts as a fuel gauge in regulating energy metabolism. It restores cellular ATP levels by switching on catabolic pathways and switching off anabolic pathways. Some evidence indicates that AMPK could be also implicated in reproductive functions such as granulosa cell steroidogenesis and nuclear oocyte maturation in several species. Some metabolic hormones such as leptin, resistin, adiponectin (three adipokines) and ghrelin may in part act through the AMPK signaling. These hormones are also involved in the control of the reproductive functions at the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis level in both male and female. Thus, AMPK could be one of the signaling pathways controlling the interactions between energy balance and reproduction. The reproductive system is tightly coupled with energy balance, and thereby metabolic abnormalities can lead to the development of some physiopathological situations such as the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Women with PCOS show altered fertility mostly associated with metabolic disorders such as insulin-resistance, hyperinsulinemia and/or dyslipidemia. Metformin, an insulin-sensitizer, is used for the treatment of women with PCOS. It restores subnormal fertility and energy balance. Recent studies show that AMPK is involved in the mechanism of action of metformin. Thus, it may be a therapeutic target. However, further investigations are necessary to elucidate the functions of AMPK in both metabolic and reproductive tissues.",

    "abstract": "Substance P (SP) is an 11-amino acid peptide that belongs to the tachykinin family of peptides. SP acts in the brain and in the periphery as a neuropeptide, neurotransmitter, and hormone affecting diverse physiologic pathways, mainly via its high-affinity neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R). Its presence in the hypothalamus and other areas of the brain that regulate feeding as well as in the stomach and small intestine prompted us to investigate its role on appetite control and energy balance. CJ 012,255 (CJ), a SP antagonist that binds to NK-1R, was injected into lean, diet-induced obese (DIO), and genetically obese (ob/ob) mice, and its effects on body weight, adiposity, and insulin sensitivity were investigated. CJ administration prevented weight gain and accumulation of fat after 2 weeks of high-fat feeding, whereas similar CJ treatment in obese mice (following 3 months of high-fat diet) resulted in weight loss, reduction in adiposity, and improvement of insulin sensitivity, in part because of inhibition of food intake. The effects of SP in the control of energy balance are, at least in part, leptin independent because CJ treatment was also effective in leptin-deficient mice. Peripheral SP administration resulted in a mild, dose-dependent increase in food intake, evident 3 hours post-SP injection. CJ reduces appetite and promotes weight loss in mice. We speculate that NK-1R antagonists, already tested in clinical trials for various diseases, may represent a potential target against obesity.",

    "abstract": "Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a class of positional, geometric, conjugated dienoic isomers of linoleic acid. Dietary CLA supplementation has resulted in a dramatic decrease in body fat mass in mice. However, some but not all studies in mice and humans have found that CLA promoted insulin resistance, and there were conflicting reports on the effects of CLA on peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR gamma) activation and expression. The objective of present study was to investigate the effect of CLA on insulin resistance and its molecular mechanisms. Fifty male Wistar rats were randomly designed to the control, high-fat and high-fat with CLA (0.75, 1.50, and 3.00 g in per 100 g diet) groups. The effect of CLA on insulin sensitivity and the mechanism of resisting diabetes by CLA were investigated by RT-PCR assay. The results showed that supplementation with CLA significantly reduced body weight gain and white fat pad weight in the rats, the levels of plasma free fatty acids (FFA), triglycerides (TGs), cholesterin (TC), leptin, insulin and blood glucose concentration in the obese rats of CLA group were also decreased compared to the rats in the high-fat group. Dietary CLA increased the mRNA expression of PPAR gamma, fatty acid binding proteins (aP2), fatty acid transporter protein (FATP), acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) and adiponectin in the adipose tissues of obese rats. The results suggest that CLA may ameliorate insulin resistance by activating PPAR gamma, and increasing the expression of PPAR gamma target genes such as ap2, FATP, FAT, and adiponectin in the white adipose tissue.",

    "abstract": "Protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a major negative regulator of insulin and leptin sensitivity. PTP1B overexpression in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle of humans and rodents may contribute to insulin resistance and obesity. The mechanisms mediating PTP1B overexpression in obese and diabetic states have been unclear. We find that adipose tissue inflammation and the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) regulate PTP1B expression in vivo. High fat feeding of mice increased PTP1B expression 1.5- to 7-fold in adipose tissue, liver, skeletal muscle, and arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus. PTP1B overexpression in high fat-fed mice coincided with increased adipose tissue expression of the macrophage marker CD68 and TNFalpha, which is implicated in causing obesity-induced insulin resistance. TNFalpha increased PTP1B mRNA and protein levels by 2- to 5-fold in a dose- and time-dependent manner in adipocyte and hepatocyte cell lines. TNFalpha administration in mice increased PTP1B mRNA 1.4- to 4-fold in adipose tissue, liver, skeletal muscle, and hypothalamic arcuate nucleus and PTP1B protein 2-fold in liver. Actinomycin D treatment blocked, and high dose salicylate treatment inhibited by 80%, TNFalpha-induced PTP1B expression in adipocyte cell lines, suggesting TNFalpha may induce PTP1B transcription via nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation from adipocyte cell lines and liver of mice demonstrated TNFalpha-induced recruitment of NFkappaB subunit p65 to the PTP1B promoter in vitro and in vivo. In mice with diet-induced obesity, TNFalpha deficiency also partly blocked PTP1B overexpression in adipose tissue. Our data suggest that PTP1B overexpression in multiple tissues in obesity is regulated by inflammation and that PTP1B may be a target of anti-inflammatory therapies.",

    "abstract": "Niacin has recently been shown to increase serum total concentrations of the adipocyte-derived protein adiponectin. Adiponectin possesses important vascular anti-inflammatory and metabolic properties that have been attributed to the active high-molecular weight (HMW) complex of the protein. Our purpose was to examine the influence of extended-release niacin on the distribution of HMW and low-molecular weight (LMW) adiponectin complexes. Fifteen men with the metabolic syndrome were treated for 6 weeks with extended-release niacin. Serum total adiponectin concentrations increased by 46% after the niacin intervention (P &lt; .05). High-molecular weight adiponectin accounted for 63% of the increase in total adiponectin, which was reflected by a shift in the HMW/LMW adiponectin ratio from 0.69 to 0.86 (+25%) (P &lt; .05). Serum insulin concentrations increased by 20% after the niacin intervention despite an increase in HMW adiponectin concentrations (P &lt; .05). These results suggest that the increase in total adiponectin concentrations observed with extended-release niacin is primarily due to an increase in the active HMW complex. Therefore, at least part of the cardioprotective benefits of niacin may be attributed to a shift in the HMW/LMW adiponectin ratio in obese men with the metabolic syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Valproic acid (VPA) is the drug of choice for treating epilepsy, but has the unwanted effects of inducing weight gain and increasing the risk of developing insulin resistance. The mechanism through which these side effects occur is unknown. VPA inhibits histone deacetylase (HDAC), but also decreases the transcriptional activity of CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (CEBPalpha). Given the possible association between VPA, CEBPalpha and adipokine gene regulation, we hypothesized that they would alter the expression of resistin (rstn), fasting-induced adipose factor (fiaf) and suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (socs-3), genes implicated in the development of leptin and insulin resistance. We investigated the effects of VPA (1 mM; 24 or 48 h) on gene expression using real-time RT-PCR in 3 distinct models: N-1 hypothalamic neurons, 3T3-L1 adipocytes and male CD-1 mice. Subsequently, cells were treated with 5 nM of the more specific HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). CEBPalpha expression was also modified in N-1 neurons using either RNA interference (RNAi) or an overexpression vector to evaluate its effects on target gene expression. In N-1 neurons, VPA induced significant increases in CEBPalpha and socs-3, but inhibited rstn and fiaf gene expression. In contrast, TSA induced rstn and socs-3, but inhibited fiaf. VPA also induced the expression of CEBPalphain 3T3-L1 adipocytes, but had no effect on other target genes, and TSA suppressed fiaf and socs-3.Subsequently, CEBPalpha was overexpressed (24 h) or silenced using RNAi (24 and 48 h) in N-1 neurons. The silencing of CEBPalpha led to significant decreases in rstn mRNA, but increased fiaf and socs-3 expression, whereas its overexpression had the opposite effect. When male CD-1 mice were treated with either a single (100 mg/kg; 24 h), or multiple (200 mg/kg; 72 h) daily injections of VPA, no changes in body weight or gene expression were detected in either hypothalamic or adipose tissues. In summary, these experiments reveal a potentially important role for CEBPalpha in the regulation of hypothalamic gene expression in N-1 neurons and suggest that it might modulate central energy metabolism. Although VPA also modified hypothalamic gene expression in vitro, it remains to be determined whether it has similar effects in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Molecular scanning of human insulin receptor substrate (Irs) genes revealed a single lrs1 prevalent variant, a glycine to arginine change at codon 972 (G972R); previous in vitro studies had demonstrated that the presence of this variant results in an impaired activation of the insulin signalling pathway, while human studies gave controversial results regarding its role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and related diseases. To address in vivo impact of this IRS-1 variant on whole body glucose homeostasis and insulin signalling, we have generated transgenic mice overexpressing it (Tg972) and evaluated insulin action in the liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue and assessed glucose homeostasis both under a normal diet and a high-fat diet. We found that Tg972 mice developed age-related glucose and insulin intolerance and hyperglycaemia, with insulin levels comparatively low. Glucose utilization and insulin signalling were impaired in all key insulin target tissues in Tg972 mice. There were no differences in pancreatic morphology between Tg972 and wild-type mice, however when insulin secretion was evaluated in isolated islets, it was significantly reduced in Tg972 mice islets at any glucose concentration tested. Under a high-fat diet, Tg972 mice had increased body and adipose tissue weight, and were more prone to develop diet-induced glucose and insulin intolerance. So, we believe that Tg972 mice may represent a useful model to elucidate the interaction between genetic and environmental factors in insulin resistance pathogenesis. Furthermore, they may become an important tool to test novel tailored therapies.",

    "title": "Effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril on body weight and composition in young rats.",
    "abstract": "Obesity is considered a worldwide public health problem showing an increased prevalence in developing countries, with urgent need for new and more efficient drugs and therapies. Enalapril, an angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), is classically used in anti-hypertensive therapies, however, earlier publications have shown that this drug could also have significant impact on body weight in rats as well as in humans, besides reducing blood pressure. The effect of this drug in the white adipose tissue has been neglected for long time, even considering that most components of the renin-angiotensin and kallikrein-kinin system are expressed in this tissue. Furthermore, the adipose tissue is considered today as one of the most important sites for endocrine/inflammatory regulation of appetite and energy output and AngII has been linked to the metabolism in this tissue. Therefore, we analyzed the influence of chronic enalapril treatment in normotensive rats at earlier ages, evaluating body weight, energy homeostasis, lipid profile and serum levels of the hormones leptin and insulin, in the presence of a standard or a palatable hyperlipidic diet regimen for one month. Our results show that enalapril treatment is able to reduce body fat on both diets, without alteration in serum lipid profile. Furthermore, animals receiving enalapril showed reduction in food intake, leptin level and energy intake. In summary, these findings show for the first time that the ACEi enalapril reduces body fat in young normotensive rats and highlights a novel target to treat obesity and associated diseases.",

    "title": "Post-translational modifications of adiponectin: mechanisms and functional implications.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin is an insulin-sensitizing adipokine with anti-diabetic, anti-atherogenic, anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective properties. This adipokine is secreted from adipocytes into the circulation as three oligomeric isoforms, including trimeric, hexameric and the HMW (high-molecular-mass) oligomeric complex consisting of at least 18 protomers. Each oligomeric isoform of adiponectin exerts distinct biological properties in its various target tissues. The HMW oligomer is the major active form mediating the insulin-sensitizing effects of adiponectin, whereas the central actions of this adipokine are attributed primarily to the hexameric and trimeric oligomers. In patients with Type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease, circulating levels of HMW adiponectin are selectively decreased due to an impaired secretion of this oligomer from adipocytes. The biosynthesis of the adiponectin oligomers is a complex process involving extensive post-translational modifications. Hydroxylation and glycosylation of several conserved lysine residues in the collagenous domain of adiponectin are necessary for the intracellular assembly and stabilization of its high-order oligomeric structures. Secretion of the adiponectin oligomers is tightly controlled by a pair of molecular chaperones in the ER (endoplasmic reticulum), including ERp44 (ER protein of 44 kDa) and Ero1-Lalpha (ER oxidoreductase 1-Lalpha). ERp44 inhibits the secretion of adiponectin oligomers through a thiol-mediated retention. In contrast, Ero1-Lalpha releases HMW adiponectin trapped by ERp44. The PPARgamma (peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor gamma) agonists thiazolidinediones selectively enhance the secretion of HMW adiponectin through up-regulation of Ero1-Lalpha. In the present review, we discuss the recent advances in our understanding of the structural and biological properties of the adiponectin oligomeric isoforms and highlight the role of post-translational modifications in regulating the biosynthesis of HMW adiponectin.",

    "abstract": "Pesticides that target molecules with critical roles in brain function deserve careful scrutiny for potential developmental neurotoxicity. In this study, time-pregnant rats were dosed daily by gavage with chlorpyrifos (2.5 mg/kg) from gestational day 7 through the end of lactation on postnatal day 21 (PND 21), and offspring were weighed regularly from birth until brain harvest at PND 22 or young adulthood (PND 95-101). The chlorpyrifos exposure caused excess weight gain in males beginning at PND 45 and reaching levels 10.5% above control by PND 72, while volumetric measurements showed that the exposed males were also 12% larger than controls. The body weight response showed an inverted U-shaped relation to chlorpyrifos dose. These data suggest delayed disturbances in body weight and density as previously unsuspected adverse consequences of developmental exposure to an environmental pesticide. Although we do not regard our findings as definitive evidence that chlorpyrifos exposure is a risk factor for obesity, the potential implications nonetheless deserve serious consideration.",

    "abstract": "Brown adipose tissue thermogenesis is an important component of energy expenditure as exemplified in rodents. Other tissues such as white adipose tissue and muscle are also capable of thermogenesis, but regulation of heat production in these tissues is poorly understood. We used a relatively large animal model, the ovariectomized sheep, in which site-specific temperature measurements were made as an index of thermogenic output. Dataloggers were implanted into the retroperitoneal (visceral) fat, gluteal (sc) fat, and skeletal muscle of the hind limb, and were programmed to record temperature every 15 min. Animals (n = 4) were then placed on a feeding schedule (fed between 1100 and 1600 h) to entrain a postprandial response in thermogenesis. Baseline thermogenesis (0800-1100 h) was higher (P &lt; 0.05) in visceral fat and muscle than in gluteal fat, whereas the amplitude of the postprandial increase was similar at all three sites. Intracerebroventricular infusion into the lateral ventricle of either vehicle (artificial cerebrospinal fluid) or leptin (10 microg/h at 100 microl/h) for 24 h (0900-0900) was performed in a cross-over design with a 1-wk recovery period between treatments. Central leptin infusion did not alter the basal thermogenic rate but markedly enhanced the postprandial response in both fat and muscle tissues. This was manifest by increased (P &lt; 0.05) amplitude and duration of the postprandial thermogenic response, and the effect was greater in muscle and visceral fat than in gluteal fat. These data demonstrate that leptin is able to regulate thermogenesis in muscle, providing a novel target for the manipulation of energy balance.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin limits the development of liver fibrosis and activates adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK is a sensor of the cellular energy status, but its possible modulation of the fibrogenic properties of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) has not been established. In this study, we investigated the role of AMPK activation in the biology of activated human HSCs. A time-dependent activation of AMPK was observed in response to a number of stimuli, including globular adiponectin, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-4-ribofuranoside (AICAR), or metformin. All these compounds significantly inhibited platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-stimulated proliferation and migration of human HSCs and reduced the secretion of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. In addition, AICAR limited the secretion of type I procollagen. Knockdown of AMPK by gene silencing increased the mitogenic effects of PDGF, confirming the negative modulation exerted by this pathway on HSCs. AMPK activation did not reduce PDGF-dependent activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) or Akt at early time points, whereas a marked inhibition was observed 24 hours after addition of PDGF, reflecting a block in cell cycle progression. In contrast, AICAR blocked short-term phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinase (p70(S6K)) and 4E binding protein-1 (4EBP1), 2 downstream effectors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, by PDGF. The ability of interleukin-a (IL-1) to activate nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) was also reduced by AICAR. Activation of AMPK negatively modulates the activated phenotype of HSCs.",

    "title": "AMP activated protein kinase: a next generation target for total metabolic control.",
    "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome is characterized by a cluster of metabolic disorders, such as reduced glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinemia, hypertension, visceral obesity and lipid disorders. The benefit of exercise in maintaining total metabolic control is well known and recent research indicates that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) may play an important role in exercise-related effects. AMPK is considered as a master switch in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism. AMPK is an enzyme that works as a fuel gauge, being activated in conditions of high phosphate depletion. In the liver, activation of AMPK results in decreased production of plasma glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride and enhanced fatty acid oxidation. AMPK is also robustly activated by skeletal muscle contraction and myocardial ischemia, and is involved in the stimulation of glucose transport and fatty acid oxidation by these stimuli. In adipose tissue, activated AMPK inhibits deposition of fat, but enhances breakdown and burning of stored fat, resulting in reduction of body weight. The two leading diabetic drugs, namely metformin and rosiglitazone, and adipokines, such as adiponectin and leptin, show their metabolic effects partially through AMPK. These data suggest that AMPK may be a key player in the development of new treatments for obesity, Type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. In this review, the author provide insight into the role of AMPK as a probable target for treatment of metabolic syndrome.",

    "title": "Leptin induces macrophage lipid body formation by a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase- and mammalian target of rapamycin-dependent mechanism.",
    "abstract": "Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone/cytokine that links nutritional status with neuroendocrine and immune functions. Lipid bodies (lipid droplets) are emerging as dynamic organelles with roles in lipid metabolism and inflammation. Here we investigated the roles of leptin in signaling pathways involved in cytoplasmic lipid body biogenesis and leukotriene B(4) synthesis in macrophages. Our results demonstrated that leptin directly activated macrophages and induced the formation of adipose differentiation-related protein-enriched lipid bodies. Newly formed lipid bodies were sites of 5-lipoxygenase localization and correlated with an enhanced capacity of leukotriene B(4) production. We demonstrated that leptin-induced macrophage activation was dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity, since the lipid body formation was inhibited by LY294002 and was absent in the PI3K knock-out mice. Leptin induces phosphorylation of p70(S6K) and 4EBP1 key downstream signaling intermediates of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in a rapamycin-sensitive mechanism. The mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, inhibited leptin-induced lipid body formation, both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, rapamycin inhibited leptin-induced adipose differentiation-related protein accumulation in macrophages and lipid body-dependent leukotriene synthesis, demonstrating a key role for mTOR in lipid body biogenesis and function. Our results establish PI3K/mTOR as an important signaling pathway for leptin-induced cytoplasmic lipid body biogenesis and adipose differentiation-related protein accumulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate a previously unrecognized link between intracellular (mTOR) and systemic (leptin) nutrient sensors in macrophage lipid metabolism. Leptin-induced increased formation of cytoplasmic lipid bodies and enhanced inflammatory mediator production in macrophages may have implications for obesity-related cardiovascular diseases.",

    "title": "Adiponectin activates adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and decreases luteinizing hormone secretion in LbetaT2 gonadotropes.",
    "abstract": "Metabolic dysregulation is associated with reproductive disorders, but the underlying mechanisms are not clearly understood. Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived secretory factor that improves insulin sensitivity. Results from animal models indicate that overexpression of adiponectin impairs female fertility. We hypothesized that adiponectin regulates reproduction by altering the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Mouse LbetaT2 immortalized gonadotrope cells express both adiponectin receptors 1 and 2. Adiponectin increases phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a downstream target of adiponectin receptors, and reduces basal and GnRH-stimulated LH secretion, acutely. The repression of LH secretion can be mimicked by 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-riboside, an AMP analog, suggesting the involvement of AMPK. A dominant-negative AMPK mutant or compound C, a selective AMPK inhibitor, potentiates basal LH secretion and abolishes the inhibitory effect of adiponectin. Chronic activation of AMPK by 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-riboside decreases cellular LH levels, and expression of dominant-negative AMPK increases cellular LH levels, suggesting a second effect of AMPK to regulate LH synthesis. Lastly, intravenous injection of an adenovirus expressing adiponectin into male mice reduces serum LH levels without changing FSH levels. In conclusion, our results suggest that adiponectin decreases LH secretion in pituitary gonadotropes in an AMPK-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "The global rate of obesity is rising alarmingly, exerting a major adverse impact on human health by increasing the prevalences of disorders, such as diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. To maintain systemic energy homeostasis, metabolic information must be communicated among organs/tissues. Obesity-related disorders can be thought of as resulting from dysregulation of this vital inter-tissue communication. Remarkable advances in obesity research during this decade have shown humoral factors manufactured and secreted by adipose tissue (adipocytokines) to be of great importance. In addition to these humoral factors, such as nutrients (glucose, fatty acids and amino acids) and hormones (insulin, adipocytokines and so on), the functional significance of the autonomic nervous system has recently attracted research attention. Autonomic nerves are essential components of the endogenous system for maintaining energy homeostasis, making them potential therapeutic targets for obesity-related disorders. This review focuses on the therapeutic possibilities of targeting inter-organ communication systems.",

    "abstract": "Early environment can shape the development and function of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) system and represents a possible risk factor for adult pathologies. One critical variable in the early environment is nutrition, and exposure to high fat (HF) in adulthood is known to change this DA system. We tested whether perinatal HF intake in rats could have long-term effects on DA function and behavior in adult offspring. Rat dams were fed either a control (5% fat, CD) or high fat (30% fat, HF) diet during the last week of gestation and lactation, and adult offspring were tested (PND 56-90) after weaning on CD. Locomotor responses to acute and repeated doses of D: -amphetamine (AMP, 0.75 mg/kg bw) were determined as were indices of DA function in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Adult HF offspring displayed increased tyrosine hydroxylase expression in the VTA and NAc and significant increases in DA and DOPAC content in the NAc, suggesting an elevated DA tone in this target field. In the NAc, there were no significant changes in D1, D2 receptors, or DA transporter (DAT) levels between diet groups. Perinatal HF feeding reduced AMP-induced locomotion and behavioral sensitization to AMP, suggesting that early diet might have caused long-lasting desensitization of postsynaptic receptor mechanisms in the NAc. Our results demonstrate that both synthetic activity in VTA neurons and the responsiveness of accumbens DA neurons is altered by maternal nutrition. These effects subside long after termination of exposure to the HF diet.",

In this study we investigated whether all three adiponectin fractions are increased equally, and, secondly, whether the increase in the biologically most active high-molecular weight (HMW) fraction can prevent the deterioration of insulin sensitivity that was also observed after niacin. We used sera frozen at -80 degrees C from a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled treatment study in which 20 men with the metabolic syndrome received 1500 mg niacin for 6 weeks. Low- and medium-molecular weight adiponectin increased by 35% and 33%, respectively, but HMW adiponectin by 88% (all p&lt;0.05). The increase in HMW adiponectin was almost two times as large in patients with lower BMI and better insulin sensitivity. However, treatment with niacin induced a deterioration of insulin sensitivity, as assessed by the HOMA-IR, independently of the increase in HMW adiponectin. HMW adiponectin is the fraction most affected by treatment with niacin. The niacin-associated deterioration of insulin sensitivity, however, occurs even in subgroups with the greatest increase of HMW adiponectin.",

    "abstract": "Oncostatin M (OSM) is a member of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) cytokine family and known to be induced in the nervous system as a result of cell stress. OSM is expressed in most human brain tumors, but the effects on tumor cells are unclear. The cytokine is known to activate the JAK/STAT signaling pathway by binding to its receptors gp130/OSMbeta or gp130/LIFRbeta and thereby initiating activation or suppression of a number of STAT target genes. The objective of the study was to identify OSM-regulated genes that could help in understanding the function of OSM in glioma cells. The glioma cell line, U1242MG was stimulated by OSM and the gene expression patterns were analyzed by microarray. In total, nineteen differentially expressed genes were selected due to high intensity, level of up/down-regulation and biological functions. The differentially expressed genes were verified using quantitative PCR. Additional validation of the confirmed OSM-induced proteins was performed in human astrocytoma tissues by immunohistochemistry. Among the up-regulated genes were CHI3L1, PLAU, MT2A and EPAS1. These genes are known to be involved in cell matrix remodeling, migration, proliferation control and angiogenesis. The results suggest that OSM induces genes that might contribute to the development and progression of astrocytomas.",

Insulin resistance and vascular function are directly affected these factors, i.e., by free fatty acids, inflammatory adipocytokines, thrombotic and antifibrinolytic factors and by adiponectin, and adipokine with insulin sensitizing and anti-inflammatory actions. Targeting these factors by antidiabetic agents should result in improved metabolism and in a reduction of vascular risk. We therefore analyzed antidiabetic treatment strategies with regard to improvements of adipose tissue derived risk factors. This shows that weight loss remains an extremely powerful tool to reduce all of these risk factors. Thiazolidinediones and rimonabant are most potent in improving numerous adipose derived risk factors but studies demonstrating reduced mortality are not yet available. Metformin has little effect on any of the adipose tissue derived factors but appears to reduce diabetes related mortality according to limited evidence. Sulfonylureas and insulin have rather limited effects on adipose tissue derived factors and are likely to exert beneficial effects mainly by improved glucose metabolism and its consequences.",

    "abstract": "Progenitors regenerate fatty livers but the mechanisms involved are uncertain. The Hedgehog pathway regulates mesendodermal progenitors and modulates mesenchymal-epithelial interactions during tissue remodeling. To determine if Hedgehog signaling increases in liver progenitors during fatty liver injury, we compared expression of Hedgehog ligands and target genes across a spectrum of injury. Leptin-deficient ob/ob mice with fatty livers and their healthy lean littermates were studied before and after exposure to the hepatotoxin, ethionine. At baseline, ob/ob mice had greater liver damage than controls. Ethionine induced liver injury in both ob/ob and lean mice, with greater injury occurring in ob/ob mice. After ethionine, the ob/ob mice developed liver atrophy and fibrosis. Liver injury increased hepatic accumulation of progenitors, including ductular cells that produced and responded to Hedgehog ligands. A dose-response relationship was demonstrated between liver injury and expansion of Hedgehog-responsive progenitors. In severely damaged, atrophic livers, nuclei in mature-appearing hepatocytes accumulated the Hedgehog-regulated mesenchymal transcription factor, Gli2 and lost expression of the liver epithelial transcription factor, hepatocyte nuclear factor 6 (HNF-6). Hepatic levels of collagen mRNA and pericellular collagen fibrils increased concomitantly. Hence, fatty liver injury increases Hedgehog activity in liver progenitors, and this might promote epithelial-mesenchymal transitions that result in liver fibrosis.",

    "title": "Adiponectin selectively inhibits oxytocin neurons of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin is an adipocyte derived hormone which acts in the brain to modulate energy homeostasis and autonomic function. The paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) which plays a key role in controlling pituitary hormone secretion has been suggested to be a central target for adiponectin actions. A number of hormones produced by PVN neurons have been implicated in the regulation of energy homeostasis including oxytocin, corticotropin releasing hormone and thyrotropin releasing hormone. In the present study we investigated the role of adiponectin in controlling the excitability of magnocellular (MNC--oxytocin or vasopressin secreting) neurons within the PVN. Using RT-PCR techniques we have shown expression of both adiponectin receptors in the PVN. Patch clamp recordings from MNC neurons in hypothalamic slices have also identified mixed (27% hyperpolarization, 42% depolarization) effects of adiponectin in modulating the excitability of the majority of MNC neurons tested. These effects are maintained when cells are placed in synaptic isolation using tetrodotoxin. Additionally we combined electrophysiological recordings with single cell RT-PCR to examine the actions of adiponectin on MNC neurons which expressed oxytocin only, vasopressin only, or both oxytocin and vasopressin mRNA and assess the profile of receptor expression in these subgroups. Adiponectin was found to hyperpolarize 100% of oxytocin neurons tested (n = 6), while vasopressin cells, while all affected (n = 6), showed mixed responses. Further analysis indicates oxytocin neurons express both receptors (6/7) while vasopressin neurons express either both receptors (3/8) or one receptor (5/8). In contrast 6/6 oxytocin/vasopressin neurons were unaffected by adiponectin. Co-expressing oxytocin and vasopressin neurons express neither receptor (4/6). The results presented in this study suggest that adiponectin plays specific roles in controlling the excitability oxytocin secreting neurons, actions which correlate with the current literature showing increased oxytocin secretion in the obese population.",

    "title": "The 'beneficial' adipokines in reproduction and fertility.",
    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to review the available information on the signaling proteins produced by adipose tissue in the context of their role in regulating reproductive processes, including ovarian and uterine function. It is well known that both obesity and excessive leanness are associated with reproductive dysfunction. Adipokines are cytokines predominantely or exclusively expressed by adipose tissue that circulate and affect target tissues. Four known adipokines, adiponectin, visfatin/PBEF, omentin and vaspin, all increase tissue sensitivity to insulin, and are thus described as 'beneficial'. There is strong support for a role for adiponectin in the function of the ovary and placenta. There is evidence for direct effects of this adipokine on the late stages of folliculogenesis, and additive interactions of adiponectin with insulin and gonadotropins in inducing periovulatory changes in ovarian follicles. In addition, clinical and genomic studies associate hypoadiponectinemia with obesity-related reproductive disorders, including the polycystic ovarian syndrome. The roles for visfatin/PBEF, omentin and vaspin in reproduction remain to be established. The conclusion thus drawn is that the expression of insulin-sensitizing adipokines varies with adipose abundance. These adipokines have demonstrated both the potential effects on ovarian function and the possible effects on the formation of the placenta, acting through multiple mechanisms.",

    "title": "Leptin protects against 6-hydroxydopamine-induced dopaminergic cell death via mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling.",
    "abstract": "The death of midbrain dopaminergic neurons in sporadic Parkinson disease is of unknown etiology but may involve altered growth factor signaling. The present study showed that leptin, a centrally acting hormone secreted by adipocytes, rescued dopaminergic neurons, reversed behavioral asymmetry, and restored striatal catecholamine levels in the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) mouse model of dopaminergic cell death. In vitro studies using the murine dopaminergic cell line MN9D showed that leptin attenuated 6-OHDA-induced apoptotic markers, including caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, and cytochrome c release. ERK1/2 phosphorylation (pERK1/2) was found to be critical for mediating leptin-induced neuroprotection, because inhibition of the MEK pathway blocked both the pERK1/2 response and the pro-survival effect of leptin in cultures. Knockdown of the downstream messengers JAK2 or GRB2 precluded leptin-induced pERK1/2 activation and neuroprotection. Leptin/pERK1/2 signaling involved phosphorylation and nuclear localization of CREB (pCREB), a well known survival factor for dopaminergic neurons. Leptin induced a marked MEK-dependent increase in pCREB that was essential for neuroprotection following 6-OHDA toxicity. Transfection of a dominant negative MEK protein abolished leptin-enhanced pCREB formation, whereas a dominant negative CREB or decoy oligonucleotide diminished both pCREB binding to its target DNA sequence and MN9D survival against 6-OHDA toxicity. Moreover, in the substantia nigra of mice, leptin treatment increased the levels of pERK1/2, pCREB, and the downstream gene product BDNF, which were reversed by the MEK inhibitor PD98059. Collectively, these data provide evidence that leptin prevents the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons by 6-OHDA and may prove useful in the treatment of Parkinson disease.",

    "title": "[The regulation of body mass and its relation to the development of obesity].",
    "abstract": "Body mass--strictly speaking: the adipose tissue mass--is regulated in a feed-back system by the hypothalamus and brainstem, where adiposity signals (leptin, insulin, amylin) and intestinal peptides (ghrelin, PYY, PP, GLP-1, OXM, CCK) and the vagal nerve provide afferent information to the central controller on the size of white adipose tissue and the actual nutritional state, respectively. Two distinct groups of neurons in the arcuate nucleus accept and process the afferent information provided by leptin produced by white adipocytes in proportion to their mass. Leptin binding to the leptin-receptors on the surface of these neurons initiates intracellular signal transduction and activation of target genes, resulting in the synthesis and release of neuropeptides (POMC, CART) with anorectic effects. Secondary centers in the brain are also activated, and finally integrated effector mechanisms are generated in order to regulate the balance between energy intake and expenditure. The regulation of body weight is carried out by the central nervous system in a complex and redundant way, characterized by interconnections and overlaps with other neuroendocrine functions, such as growth, thyroid and adrenal function, memory, addictive and reward mechanisms. Targeting one or another component of this complicated system with drugs might result in interference with other systems and functions, so the occurrence of adverse events is probable. The worldwide epidemic of obesity--resulting mostly from the abundance of energy-dense foods and sedentary lifestyle coupled with a regulatory system unable to cope with this environment--has resulted in a continuous increase of research activities in both academic and industrial centers to develop new drugs and treatment strategies beyond lifestyle changes (diet, physical activity and behavioral therapy) to fight obesity more effectively.",

    "abstract": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) regulates adipocyte genes involved in adipogenesis and lipid metabolism and is the molecular target for thiazolidinedione (TZD) antidiabetic agents. Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) is a recently described triglyceride-specific lipase that is induced during adipogenesis and remains highly expressed in mature adipocytes. This study evaluates the ability of PPARgamma to directly regulate ATGL expression in adipocytes in vitro and in vivo. In fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, ATGL mRNA and protein are increased by TZD and non-TZD PPARgamma agonists in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Rosiglitazone-mediated induction of ATGL mRNA is rapid and is not inhibited by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, indicating that intervening protein synthesis is not required for this effect. Rosiglitazone-mediated induction of ATGL mRNA and protein is inhibited by the PPARgamma-specific antagonist GW-9662 and is also significantly reduced following siRNA-mediated knockdown of PPARgamma, supporting the direct transcriptional regulation of ATGL by PPARgamma. In vivo, ATGL mRNA and protein are increased by rosiglitazone treatment in white and brown adipose tissue of mice with and without obesity due to high-fat diet or leptin deficiency. Thus, PPARgamma positively regulates ATGL mRNA and protein expression in mature adipocytes in vitro and in adipose tissue in vivo, suggesting a role for ATGL in mediating PPARgamma's effects on lipid metabolism.",

    "title": "Hepatic dysfunction and insulin insensitivity in type 2 diabetes mellitus: a critical target for insulin-sensitizing agents.",
    "abstract": "The liver plays an essential role in maintaining glucose homeostasis, which includes insulin-mediated processes such as hepatic glucose output (HGO) and uptake, as well as in clearance of insulin itself. In type 2 diabetes, the onset of hyperglycaemia [itself a potent inhibitor of hepatic glucose output (HGO)], alongside hyperinsulinaemia, indicates the presence of hepatic insulin insensitivity. Increased HGO is central to the onset of hyperglycaemia and highlights the need to target hepatic insulin insensitivity as a central component of glucose-lowering therapy. The mechanisms underlying the development of hepatic insulin insensitivity are not well understood, but may be influenced by factors such as fatty acid oversupply and altered adipocytokine release from dysfunctional adipose tissue and increased liver fat content. Furthermore, although the impact of insulin insensitivity as a marker of cardiovascular disease is well known, the specific role of hepatic insulin insensitivity is less clear. The pharmacological tools available to improve insulin sensitivity include the biguanides (metformin) and thiazolidinediones (rosiglitazone and pioglitazone). Data from a number of sources indicate that thiazolidinediones, in particular, can improve multiple aspects of hepatic dysfunction, including reducing HGO, insulin insensitivity and liver fat content, as well as improving other markers of liver function and the levels of mediators with potential involvement in hepatic function, including fatty acids and adipocytokines. The current review addresses this topic from the perspective of the role of the liver in maintaining glucose homeostasis, its key involvement in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and the tools currently available to reduce hepatic insulin insensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Excess caloric intake can lead to insulin resistance. The underlying reasons are complex but likely related to ectopic lipid deposition in nonadipose tissue. We hypothesized that the inability to appropriately expand subcutaneous adipose tissue may be an underlying reason for insulin resistance and beta cell failure. Mice lacking leptin while overexpressing adiponectin showed normalized glucose and insulin levels and dramatically improved glucose as well as positively affected serum triglyceride levels. Therefore, modestly increasing the levels of circulating full-length adiponectin completely rescued the diabetic phenotype in ob/ob mice. They displayed increased expression of PPARgamma target genes and a reduction in macrophage infiltration in adipose tissue and systemic inflammation. As a result, the transgenic mice were morbidly obese, with significantly higher levels of adipose tissue than their ob/ob littermates, leading to an interesting dichotomy of increased fat mass associated with improvement in insulin sensitivity. Based on these data, we propose that adiponectin acts as a peripheral starvation signal promoting the storage of triglycerides preferentially in adipose tissue. As a consequence, reduced triglyceride levels in the liver and muscle convey improved systemic insulin sensitivity. These mice therefore represent what we believe is a novel model of morbid obesity associated with an improved metabolic profile.",

Whereas the effects of ghrelin in the regulation of appetite, food intake and energy homeostasis have been fairly well documented, the pathways responsible for the effects of ghrelin are now increasingly being understood. As a consequence, clinical applications of ghrelin are now being developed. Ghrelin is an endogenous orexigenic peptide recently discovered in the stomach. Ghrelin is involved in short-term regulation of food intake since its plasma levels increase before meals and decrease strongly postprandially. Ghrelin is also involved in long-term body-weight regulation by inducing adiposity. Ghrelin might be useful for cachexia and obesity treatment.",

    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is recognized as the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. NAFLD is a clinicopathologic syndrome ranging from simple steatosis, which is relatively benign, to the more severe form known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which may progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD is associated with significant liver related morbidity and mortality, and its underlying pathophysiology is thought to result from a multiple hit process. The initial insult is the accumulation of hepatic fat secondary to insulin resistance. In the setting of hepatic steatosis, the second hit can be caused by reactive oxygen species, inflammatory cytokines, and adipokines. Several therapeutic modalities that target these mechanisms are under investigation, but no proven treatment has yet emerged. Insulin sensitizers such as thiazolidinediones and metformin show promise, and several studies have explored the role of lipid lowering agents, antioxidants, and cytoprotective agents. Novel agents such as anti-obesity drugs, selective cannabinoid-1 receptor blockers, and dual PPAR alpha and gamma agonists are also under investigation. Unfortunately, data on the long-term safety and efficacy of these agents and their impact on liver related histologic outcomes are currently lacking. NAFLD treatment currently focuses on reducing metabolic risk factors, with the mainstay of therapy focusing on life-style modifications such as gradual weight loss through diet and regular exercise.",

    "abstract": "Several established liver diseases of various causes are highly associated with hepatic insulin resistance, which is characterized by the desensitization of target cells to insulin. Peripheral insulin resistance is observed in most patients who have cirrhosis. Conversely, insulin-resistant diabetic patients are at increased risk for developing liver disease. Current therapeutic interventions in insulin resistance are limited and therefore likely to be advanced by new tailor-made drugs. Oltipraz, a prototype dithiolthione, inhibits transforming growth factor beta1 and has the ability to regenerate cirrhotic liver. We investigated the effects of oltipraz and synthetic dithiolthiones on hepatic insulin resistance and the molecular basis of action. Oltipraz and other dithiolethione compounds were tested on tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced insulin resistance and glucose homeostasis in vitro and in vivo via immunoblotting, plasmid transfection, kinase analysis, and functional assays. Oltipraz treatment inhibited the ability of TNF-alpha to activate p70 ribosomal S6 kinase-1 (S6K1) downstream of mammalian target of rapamycin, thus preventing insulin receptor substrate-1 serine phosphorylation and protecting insulin signals. Moreover, oltipraz activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), whose inhibition by a dominant negative mutant abolished S6K1 inhibition and protected insulin signaling, indicating that AMPK activation leads to S6K1 inhibition. In hepatocyte-derived cell lines, oltipraz inhibited glucose production. Oltipraz prevented hepatic insulin resistance in C57BL/6 mice challenged with endotoxin (or TNF-alpha), leptin-deficient mice, and mice fed a high-fat diet. Synthetic dithiolethiones comparably inhibited insulin resistance. Our findings led to the identification of dithiolethione compounds that prevent insulin resistance through a mechanism involving AMPK-mediated S6K1 inhibition and thereby sensitize hepatic insulin response.",

    "title": "The endocannabinoid system: a new target for the regulation of energy balance and metabolism.",
    "abstract": "Recent studies have provided evidence that the endocannabinoid (EC) system has very significant effects on energy balance and metabolism through the central control of appetite and by affecting peripheral metabolism. Endocannabinoids are endogenous phospholipid derivatives which bind and activate cannabinoid receptors type 1 and type 2 (CB1 and CB2 receptors). The CB1 receptor, a G-protein coupled receptor, is believed to be responsible for the majority of the central effects of endocannaboids on appetite. Chronic positive energy balance and obesity have been associated with an overactivation of the endocannaboid system which has been suggested to contribute to the development of abdominal obesity and to associated metabolic abnormalities which increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Animal studies had shown that stimulation of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor with endocannaboids such as anandamide could induce first an increase in food intake leading to body weight gain. Furthermore, an exciting development in this field has been the discovery of CB1 receptors in many peripheral tissues, including key organs involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism such as the adipose tissue and liver. Thus, blocking CB1 receptors located in the liver and adipose tissue could have an additional impact on the metabolic risk profile beyond what could be explained by the reduction in food intake and the related body weight loss. Preclinical studies have shown that rimonabant, the first CB1-receptor blocker to be available in clinical practice, could not only induce a reduction in food intake, but could also produce body weight loss beyond what could be explained by its effect on food intake. Thus, the evidence from preclinical studies have suggested that CB1 blockade could represent a relevant approach to reduce food intake, to induce body weight loss, and, most importantly, to fix the dysmetabolic state of viscerally obese patients at increased cardiometabolic risk.",

    "title": "Phloretin enhances adipocyte differentiation and adiponectin expression in 3T3-L1 cells.",
    "abstract": "Adipocyte dysfunction is strongly associated with the development of cardiovascular risk factors and diabetes. It is accepted that the regulation of adipogenesis or adipokines expression, notably adiponectin, is able to prevent these disorders. In this report, we show that phloretin, a dietary flavonoid, enhances 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation as evidenced by increased triglyceride accumulation and GPDH activity. At a molecular level, mRNA expression levels of both PPARgamma and C/EBPalpha, the master adipogenic transcription factors, are markedly increased by phloretin. Moreover, mRNA levels of PPARgamma target genes such as LPL, aP2, CD36 and LXRalpha are up-regulated by phloretin. We also show that phloretin enhances the expression and secretion of adiponectin. Co-transfection studies suggest the induction of PPARgamma transcriptional activity as a possible mechanism underlying the phloretin-mediated effects. Taken together, these results suggest that phloretin may be beneficial for reducing insulin resistance through its potency to regulate adipocyte differentiation and function.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the efficacy and safety of two different dosing regimens of fixed-dose combination (FDC) rosiglitazone (RSG) plus glimepiride (GLIM) compared with RSG or GLIM monotherapy in drug-naive subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Drug-naive subjects (n = 901) were enrolled into this 28-week, double-blind, parallel-group study if their glycosylated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) was &gt;7.5% but &lt;or=12%. Subjects were randomized to receive either GLIM [4 mg once daily (OD) maximal], RSG (8 mg OD maximal) or RSG/GLIM FDC regimen A (4 mg/4 mg OD maximal) or RSG/GLIM FDC regimen B (8 mg/4 mg OD maximal). Patients were assessed for efficacy and safety every 4 weeks for the first 12 weeks of the study, and at weeks 20 and 28. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in HbA(1c) from baseline. Key secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients achieving recommended HbA(1c) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) targets; change from baseline in FPG, insulin, C-reactive protein (CRP), adiponectin, free fatty acids and lipids; and percentage change in homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function. Safety evaluations included adverse-event (AE) monitoring and clinical laboratory evaluations. At week 28, both RSG/GLIM FDC regimens significantly reduced HbA(1c) (mean +/- s.d.: -2.4 +/- 1.4% FDC regimen A; -2.5 +/- 1.4% FDC regimen B) to a greater extent than RSG (-1.8 +/- 1.5%) or GLIM (-1.7 +/- 1.4%) monotherapy (model-adjusted mean treatment difference, p &lt; 0.0001 vs. both RSG and GLIM). Significantly more subjects achieved HbA(1c) target levels of &lt;or=6.5 and &lt;7% with either RSG/GLIM FDC regimen compared with RSG or GLIM alone (model-adjusted odds ratio, p &lt; 0.0001 for both comparisons). Similarly, a significantly greater reduction in FPG levels was observed in subjects treated with the RSG/GLIM FDC [mean +/- s.d. (mg/dl): -69.5 +/- 57.5 FDC regimen A; -79.9 +/- 56.8 FDC regimen B) compared with RSG (-56.6 +/- 58.1) or GLIM (-42.2 +/- 66.1) monotherapy (model-adjusted mean treatment difference, p &lt; 0.0001 for both comparisons). Improvement in CRP was also observed in subjects who were treated with a RSG/GLIM FDC or RSG monotherapy compared with GLIM monotherapy. RSG/GLIM FDC was generally well tolerated, with no new safety or tolerability issues identified from its monotherapy components, and a similar AE profile was observed across FDC regimens. The most commonly reported AE was hypoglycaemia, and the incidence of confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia (3.6-5.5%) was comparable among subjects treated with an RSG/GLIM FDC and GLIM monotherapy. Compared with RSG or GLIM monotherapy, the RSG/GLIM FDC improved glycaemic control with no significant increased risk of hypoglycaemia. RSG/GLIM FDC provides an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for drug-naive individuals with T2DM.",

    "title": "Visceral fat as target of highly active antiretroviral therapy-associated metabolic syndrome.",
    "abstract": "HIV-associated lipodystrophy or lipoatrophy, unreported before the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), was first described in 1998, and has a prevalence ranging from 18% to 83%. As in genetic lipodystrophy syndromes, fat redistribution may precede the development of metabolic complications (dyslipidemia, insulin resistance) in HIV-infected patients receiving HAART. The pathogenesis of HAART-associated lipodystrophy and metabolic syndrome is complex and a number of factors are involved, including direct effects of HAART on lipid metabolism, endothelial and adipocyte cell function, and mitochondria. Protease inhibitors are responsible for a decrease in cytoplasmic retinoic-acid protein-1, in low density lipoprotein-receptor-related protein and in peroxisome proliferator activated receptor type-gamma. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and thymidine analogues, are responsible for mitochondrial dysfunction as demonstrated by a decrease in subcutaneous adipose tissue mitochondrial DNA content. Both phenomena are responsible for a decreased differentiation of adipocytes, increased levels of free fatty acids and lipoatrophy. The increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin-6 may further contribute in development of lipodystrophy. TNF-alfa activates 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type-1, which converts inactive cortisone to active cortisol, resulting in increased lipid accumulation in adipocytes and insulin resistance. HAART drugs and inflammatory cytokines are associated with a decrease in adiponectin. The levels of adiponectin and adiponectin-to-leptin ratio correlate positively with insulin resistance in HIV-infected patients with lipodystrophy. HAART-associated metabolic syndrome is an increasingly recognized clinical entity. The atherogenic profile of this syndrome may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease even in young HIV-infected patients. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for this syndrome will lead to the discovery of new drugs that will reduce the incidence of lipodystrophy and related metabolic complications in HIV-infected patients receiving HAART.",

    "title": "Adipogenic signaling in rat white adipose tissue: modulation by aging and calorie restriction.",
    "abstract": "Alterations in adipogenesis could have significant impact on several aging processes. We previously reported that calorie restriction (CR) in rats significantly increases the level of circulating adiponectin, a distinctive marker of differentiated adipocytes, leading to a concerted modulation in the expression of key transcription target genes and, as a result, to increased fatty acid oxidation and reduced deleterious lipid accumulation in other tissues. These findings led us to investigate further the effects of aging on adipocytes and to determine how CR modulates adipogenic signaling in vivo. CR for 2 and 25 months, significantly increased the expression of PPARgamma, C/EBPbeta and Cdk-4, and partially attenuated age-related decline in C/EBPalpha expression relative to rats fed ad libitum (AL). As a result, adiponectin was upregulated at both mRNA and protein levels, resulting in activation of target genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and fatty acid synthesis, and greater responsiveness of adipose tissue to insulin. Moreover, CR significantly decreased the ratio of C/EBPbeta isoforms LAP/LIP, suggesting the suppression of gene transcription associated with terminal differentiation while facilitating preadipocytes proliferation. Morphometric analysis revealed a greater number of small adipocytes in CR relative to AL feeding. Immunostaining confirmed that small adipocytes were more strongly positive for adiponectin than the large ones. Overall these results suggest that CR increased the expression of adipogenic factors, and maintained the differentiated state of adipocytes, which is critically important for adiponectin biosynthesis and insulin sensitivity.",

We compare the efficacy, safety, and effects on serum adipocytokines and inflammatory markers of both regimens in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A prospective, randomized, double-blind study enrolled 55 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, which were randomly assigned to receive either metformin SR or RR (at a maximal dosage of 2000 mg/d for 12 weeks). Glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose, adipocytokines, C-reactive protein, and insulin resistance and pancreatic beta-cell function were measured before and after treatment. Significant decreases (P&lt;.001) in mean HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose levels were observed in each group. However, the mean changes in HbA1c from baseline to end point in the 2 groups were not significantly different. Changes in metabolic parameters were similar except that a decreased total cholesterol level was observed in the metformin RR group. Neither regimen treatment had any influence on insulin resistance, but metformin RR improved beta-cell function. Neither regimen had an effect on serum adipocytokines or inflammatory markers. Once-daily metformin SR was as safe and effective as metformin RR in type 2 diabetic patients. Neither dosage form affected serum adipocytokines and inflammatory markers.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the potency of MFL in vitro and efficacy in vivo for intraperitoneal treatment of mice implanted with human ovarian carcinoma cells. The potency of MFL was compared to that of other Fas agonists in a cytotoxicity assay on SKOV-3 cells. The potency of MFL was further determined by measuring apoptosis in combination with cisplatin. The efficacy of MFL was determined in vivo using peritoneal xenograft models of human ovarian carcinoma. In vitro, MFL induced significantly higher levels of apoptosis than other Fas agonists, and was able to overcome the resistance of the ovarian cancer cell line SKOV-3 to Fas agonist antibody. MFL exerted an enhanced cytotoxic effect when combined with platinum-based drugs, leading to significantly more apoptosis than by incubation with MFL or these drugs alone. Treatment of mice xenografted with SKOV-3 and HOC79 ovarian tumors by intraperitoneal administration of MFL alone or in combination with cisplatin resulted in a significant decrease in peritoneal tumor nodules and ascitic cells, and prolongation of survival as compared to non-treated mice. The beneficial effects of MFL treatment occurred in the absence of severe toxicity. MFL is a novel pro-apoptotic molecule that is able to efficiently induce apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells as well as to potentiate the activity of chemotherapeutic agents in vitro and in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Leptin, a potent anorexigenic hormone, is found in the anterior pituitary (AP). The aim of this study was to determine whether and how pituitary leptin-bearing cells are regulated by nutritional status. Male rats showed 64% reductions in pituitary leptin mRNA 24 hr after fasting, accompanied by significant (30-50%) reductions in growth hormone (GH), prolactin, and luteinizing hormone (LH), and 70-80% reductions in target cells for gonadotropin-releasing hormone or growth hormone-releasing hormone. There was a 2-fold increase in corticotropes. Subsets (22%) of pituitary cells coexpressed leptin and GH, and &lt;5% coexpressed leptin and LH, prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, or adrenocorticotropic hormone. Fasting resulted in significant (55-75%) losses in cells with leptin proteins or mRNA, and GH or LH. To determine whether restoration of serum glucose could rescue leptin, LH, and GH, additional fasted rats were given 10% glucose water for 24 hr. Restoring serum glucose in fasted rats resulted in pituitary cell populations with normal levels of leptin and GH and LH cells. Similarly, LH and GH cells were restored in vitro after populations from fasted rats were treated for as little as 1 hr in 10-100 pg/ml leptin. These correlative changes in pituitary leptin, LH, and GH, coupled with leptin's rapid restoration of GH and LH in vitro, suggest that pituitary leptin may signal nutritional changes. Collectively, the findings suggest that pituitary leptin expression could be coupled to glucose sensors like glucokinase to facilitate rapid responses by the neuroendocrine system to nutritional cues.",

    "abstract": "The heart is a resistin target tissue and can function as an autocrine organ. We sought to investigate whether cyclic mechanical stretch could induce resistin expression in cardiomyocytes and to test whether there is a link between the stretch-induced TNF-alpha and resistin. Neonatal Wistar rat cardiomyocytes grown on a flexible membrane base were stretched by vacuum to 20% of maximum elongation at 60 cycles/min. Cyclic stretch significantly increased resistin protein and mRNA expression after 2-18 h of stretch. Addition of PD-98059, TNF-alpha antibody, TNF-alpha receptor antibody, and ERK MAP kinase small interfering RNA 30 min before stretch inhibited the induction of resistin protein. Cyclic stretch increased, whereas PD-98059 abolished, the phosphorylated ERK protein. Gel-shift assay showed a significant increase in DNA-protein binding activity of NF-kappaB after stretch, and PD-98059 abolished the DNA-protein binding activity induced by cyclic stretch. DNA binding complexes induced by cyclic stretch could be supershifted by p65 monoclonal antibody. Cyclic stretch increased resistin promoter activity, whereas PD-98059 and p65 antibody decreased resistin promoter activity. Cyclic stretch significantly increased TNF-alpha secretion from myocytes. Recombinant resistin protein and conditioned medium from stretched cardiomyocytes reduced glucose uptake in cardiomyocytes, and recombinant small interfering RNA of resistin or TNF-alpha antibody reversed glucose uptake. In conclusion, cyclic mechanical stretch enhances resistin expression in cultured rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. The stretch-induced resistin is mediated by TNF-alpha, at least in part, through ERK MAP kinase and NF-kappaB pathways. Glucose uptake in cardiomyocytes was reduced by resistin upregulation.",

    "abstract": "Adipose tissue, which classically has been considered as an energy-storing organ, is now viewed as a massive source of bioactive substances such as leptin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and adiponectin. Adiponectin was discovered to be the most abundant adipose-specific transcript. Its function had been unclear, but epidemiological and clinical studies have demonstrated that serum levels of adiponectin are inversely associated with body weight, especially abdominal visceral fat accumulation. In addition, adiponectin was inversely related to cardiovascular risk factors, such as insulin resistance, blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and was positively related to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. Moreover, low adiponectin concentration is associated with a high incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, some kinds of cancer, and other various diseases. These associations suggest the clinical significance of adiponectin, and a number of investigations are now being conducted to clarify the biological functions of adiponectin. Recent studies have revealed that adiponectin exhibits antiinflammatory, antiatherogenic, and antidiabetic properties. In addition, adiponectin has been thought to be a key molecule in metabolic syndrome, which is an epidemiological target for preventing cardiovascular disease. Various functions of adiponectin may possibly serve to prevent and treat obesity-related diseases and CVD. Furthermore, enhancement of adiponectin secretion or action may become a promising therapeutic target.",

    "title": "Acute, but not chronic, leptin treatment induces acyl-CoA oxidase in C2C12 myotubes.",
    "abstract": "The product of the obesity gene (ob), leptin, has a well-recognized role in regulating energy homeostasis. During the period of weight maintenance, circulating leptin concentration reflects total body fat mass. On the other hand, overnutrition is accompanied by progressive hyperleptinemia. In overnourished animals, the elevation in circulating fatty acids results in increased uptake and excessive deposition of lipids within muscle cells. Consequently, triglicerydes overload seems to strongly correlate to the impairment of insulin signaling in skeletal muscle, the primary target for insulin stimulated glucose disposal. High levels of leptin in the course of fat storage may protect non-adipose tissues from lipid accumulation. Here, we aim to evaluate in vitro the relationship between leptin treatment and expression of acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX), a peroxisomal key enzyme involved in fatty acid catabolism. We also evaluate the adaptive response of cells to a putative oxidative insult, resulting from H(2)O(2) production. The effects of increasing levels of leptin, at different times, were assessed on mouse C2C12 myotubes by semiquantitative PCR. Activation pathway was investigated by using extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) inhibitors. Cellular adaptive response to oxidative stress was evaluated by measuring glutathione concentration, oxidized/reduced glutathione ratio and the main antioxidant enzymatic activities. A 1.8-fold increase in ACOX mRNA expression was evident at 20 ng/ml leptin, a dose comparable to that found in hyperleptinemic subjects. The induction was dose-dependent, with an increase of 3-fold at 100 ng/ml; the ability of leptin to stimulate ACOX mRNA reached a maximum at 20 min and was lost in myotubes continuously exposed for more than 1 h. ACOX enzymatic activity followed mRNA changes: it was doubled after 1 h treatment and remained elevated for 24 h. ERK and cPLA(2) pathway is involved, since their inhibitors abrogated the ACOX mRNA induction. Myotubes counteract the resulting oxidative insult by catalase and glutathione peroxidase activation, thus removing H(2)O(2) at the expenses of the reduced glutahione pool. The present study shows that acute, but not chronic, leptin treatment of C2C12 myotubes induces ACOX expression. Peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation may work together with mitochondrial beta-oxidation to remove excessive lipids from non-adipose tissues, during early stages of overnutrition and before development of leptin resistance.",

    "title": "[Niacin in therapy].",
    "abstract": "Niacin (nicotinic acid and nicotinamide) is a vitamin used as a source of the NAD+ and NADP+ coenzymes required for many metabolic processes. Its low dietary levels induce the development of pellagra. Niacin has been used for decades in the treatment of patients with disturbed lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, this being the main cause of atherosclerotic changes in cardiovascular diseases. It is still the most efficacious drug in terms of its ability to increase HDL cholesterol content accompanied by a decrease in all atherogenic lipoproteins (VLDL, LDL, and L(a)) as well as fatty acids and triglycerides. Niacin also increases adiponectin level, which might result in additional atheroprotection. There are studies confirming the beneficial action of niacin against migraine and hyperphosphatemia associated with renal failure, ethanol-induced neurodegeneration, and loss of beta-cell function in type 1 diabetes. Moreover, it augments plasma tryptophan concentrations in HIV-infected patients and thyroid radiosensitivity to 131I. Inhibition of the invasion of hepatoma cells has also been proven. However, it is necessary to point out that the currently applied niacin preparations might exhibit such side effects as cutaneous flushing, gastrointestinal disturbances, and hepatotoxicity, particularly during treatment with sustained-release niacin preparations. The recent discovery of the G-protein-coupled receptor GPR109A, which mediates the antilipolytic effects induced by nicotinic acid in adipocytes as well as cutaneous vasodilation, allows the development of new agents interacting with this receptor. In view of these observations, niacin therapy must be accompanied by control of the choice of niacin preparation and its dose in order to eliminate or at least limit its side effects.",

    "title": "Appetite regulation: an overview.",
    "abstract": "Obesity is a major public health problem associated with morbidity and mortality and continues to increase worldwide. This review focuses on the regions of the brain that are important in appetite regulation and the circulating factors implicated in the control of food intake. The hypothalamus is critical in the regulation of food intake containing neural circuits, which produce a number of peptides that influence food intake. The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus produces both orexigenic peptides (agouti-related protein and neuropeptide Y) and anorectic peptides (alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and cocaine- and amphetamine-related transcript). The lateral hypothalamus produces the orexigenic peptides (melanin-concentrating hormone and orexins). Other hypothalamic factors recently implicated in appetite regulation include the endocannabinoids, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, nesfatin-1, AMP-activated protein kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin protein, and protein tyrosine phosphatase. Circulating factors that affect food intake mediate their effects by signaling to the hypothalamus and/or brainstem. A number of circulating factors are produced by peripheral organs, for example, leptin by adipose tissue, insulin and pancreatic polypeptide by the pancreas, gut hormones (e.g., ghrelin, obestatin, glucagon-like peptide-1, oxyntomodulin, peptide YY), and triiodothyronine by the thyroid gland. Circulating carbohydrates, lipids, and amino acids also affect appetite regulation. Knowledge regarding appetite regulation has vastly expanded in recent years providing targets for antiobesity drug design.",

    "abstract": "Advances in molecular biology and the clinical success of strategies that target tumor necrosis factor (TNF) have led to further research into the pathophysiology of human rheumatoid arthritis. Several novel therapeutic targets have emerged from these efforts, including not only molecules that regulate TNF (e.g. TNF-alpha converting enzyme), the complex cytokine network (e.g. interleukin [IL]-6, IL-15, IL-17) and several adipokines, but also targets that originate from cellular and subcellular components of the disease. Strategies that aim at cellular targets include antibodies to CD20 or BLyS (also known as TNF ligand family member 13b), which deplete or inhibit B cells, as well as approaches that interfere with membrane-derived microparticles. Components of subcellular pathways, which are predominantly upstream of the central regulator of transcription nuclear factor kappaB, have also been studied. Of these, strategies that target mitogen-activated protein kinases have a leading role and are on the verge of clinical use; approaches that target specific molecules such as Janus kinases, signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins, and suppressor of cytokine signaling proteins also seem to show promise and might have a clinical application in the future.",

    "title": "Metabolic stress with a high carbohydrate diet increases adiponectin levels.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin is an adipose tissue-specific protein, which possesses anti-atherogenic and antidiabetic properties, yet its plasma levels are decreased in subjects with metabolic syndrome. Although high fat diet has been linked to hypoadiponectinemia, the effect of high-carbohydrate diet on adiponectin levels is not known. Therefore, we studied the effect of high-carbohydrate diet on adiponectin levels in the rat models of hypertension and insulin resistance. Rats were randomly assigned to the high carbohydrate diet [Sprague-Dawley rats with fructose enriched diet (SDR-F) and spontaneously hypertensive rats with sucrose enriched diet (SHR-S model)] or chow diet (Control group). Rats were followed for 6 weeks (SDR-F model) and 8 weeks (SHR-S model). Body weight, systolic blood pressure, plasma levels of glucose, insulin, triglycerides and adiponectin, were recorded. Both models were associated with features of the metabolic syndrome, namely, high insulin levels, increased blood pressure and triglyceride levels. Plasma adiponectin levels did not change in the control groups. In contrast, adiponectin levels increased by 39 and 30% compared to baseline following four and six weeks of fructose enriched diet in SDR (from 3.3+/-0.2 to 4.5+/-0.4 and 4.3+/-0.2 microg/ml, respectively, p&lt;0.05). Likewise, five and eight weeks of sucrose enriched diet in SHR, induced a 54 and 81% increase in adiponectin levels compared to baseline (from 4.2+/-0.3 to 6.3+/-0.3 and 7.3+/-0.5 microg/ml, respectively, p&lt;0.01). Metabolic stress with a high-carbohydrate diet increases plasma levels of adiponectin. Further studies will elucidate whether this is a transitory compensatory mechanism or a sign of target organ resistance to adiponectin.",

    "abstract": "To investigate whether epigenetic mechanisms can regulate leptin's expression and affect its downstream targets as metalloproteinases 3,9,13 in osteoarthritic chondrocytes. DNA methylation in leptin promoter was measured by DNA bisulfite sequencing, and mRNA expression levels were measured by real-time quantitative PCR in osteoarthritic as well as in normal cartilage. Osteoarthritic articular cartilage samples were obtained from two distinct locations of the knee (n = 15); from the main defective area of maximum load (advanced osteoarthritis (OA)) and from adjacent macroscopically intact regions (minimal OA). Using small interference RNA, we tested if leptin downregulation would affect matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13 activity. We also evaluated the effect of the demethylating agent, 5'-Aza-2-deoxycytidine (AZA) and of the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) on leptin expression in chondrocyte cultures. Furthermore, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation in leptin's promoter area. We found a correlation between leptin expression and DNA methylation and also that leptin controls MMP-13 activity in chondrocytes. Leptin's downregulation with small interference RNA inhibited MMP-13 expression dramatically. After 5-AZA application in normal chondrocytes, leptin's methylation was decreased, while its expression was upregulated, and MMP-13 was activated. Furthermore, TSA application in normal chondrocyte cultures increased leptin's expression. Also, chromatin immunoprecipitation in leptin's promoter after TSA treatment revealed that histone H3 lysines 9 and 14 were acetylated. We found that epigenetic mechanisms regulate leptin's expression in chondrocytes affecting its downstream target MMP-13. Small interference RNA against leptin deactivated directly MMP-13, which was upregulated after leptin's epigenetic reactivation, raising the issue of leptin's therapeutic potential for osteoarthritis.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the role of the central melanocortin system in the control of fuel metabolism in peripheral tissues. Skeletal muscle AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is activated by leptin and serves as a master regulator of fatty acid beta-oxidation. To elucidate an unidentified role of the central melanocortin system in muscle AMPK regulation, we treated conscious, unrestrained mice intracerebroventricularly with the melanocortin agonist MT-II or the antagonist SHU9119. MT-II augmented phosphorylation of AMPK and its target acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) independent of caloric intake. Conversely, AMPK/ACC phosphorylation by leptin was abrogated by the coadministration of SHU9119 or in KKA(y) mice, which centrally express endogenous melanocortin antagonist. Importantly, high-fat-diet-induced attenuation of AMPK/ACC phosphorylation in leptin-overexpressing transgenic mice was not reversed by central leptin but was markedly restored by MT-II. Our data provide evidence for the critical role of the central melanocortin system in the leptin-skeletal muscle AMPK axis and highlight the system as a therapeutic target in leptin resistance.",

    "abstract": "We assessed the time course effects of lipopolysaccaride (LPS) on food intake, cytokines, and hormones in rats and evaluated the relation between LPS-induced anorexia and its possible causative factors. Food intake was reduced 2 h after LPS injection (500 microg/kg, intraperitoneally) and remained decreased for 24 h. Plasma TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels increased by LPS administration at 0.5 and 2 h, and at 2 and 4 h, respectively. Plasma leptin and glucose levels were elevated at 8 and 16 h, and insulin levels were elevated at 2, 4, 8, and 16 h in the LPS-injected group, as compared to the counterpart controls. IL-6 levels in the CSF were elevated at 2 and 4 h. Hypothalamic cytokines tended to increase as early as 0.5 h after LPS injection and remained increased until 16 h. LPS-induced anorexia was attenuated in insulin-deficient STZ rats and was abolished by insulin treatment. The hypothalamic expression of NPY, a target of insulin's anorexic effect, was decreased 2 h after LPS administration, and central NPY injection (3 nM) prevented LPS-induced anorexia. In conclusion, cytokines, insulin, and leptin levels evidence different time courses by LPS administration. In LPS-induced anorexia, insulin may constitute a newly found causative factor, whereas leptin appears to be uninvolved in an early period in rats.",

To examine adiponectin's contribution to insulin action, we analyzed adiponectin levels and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in insulin receptor transgenic/knockout mice (L1), a genetic model of resistance to insulin's indirect effects on hepatic glucose production. In euglycemic, insulin-resistant L1 mice, we detected hyperadiponectinemia with normal levels of adiponectin receptor-1 and -2. Moreover, adiponectin administration is unable to lower glucose levels or induce activation of AMPK, consistent with a state of adiponectin resistance. In a subset of hyperglycemic L1 mice, we observed decreased mRNA expression of AdipoR2 in liver and muscle, as well as decreased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)alpha target gene expression in liver, raising the possibility that deterioration of adiponectin/AdipoR2 signaling via PPARalpha activation contributes to the progression from compensated insulin resistance to diabetes. In contrast, we failed to detect changes in other markers of the systemic or local inflammatory response. These data provide evidence for a mechanism of adiponectin resistance and corroborate the notion that adiponectin potentiates hepatic insulin sensitivity.",

Several strategies are being pursued to improve the pharmacological properties of PTP1B inhibitors.

    "title": "[Aging and retinal vascular diseases].",
    "abstract": "Ocular vascular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, and age-related macular degeneration, whose population increases along with aging, have become leading causes of severe visual disturbance. Macular edema and serous retinal detachment are associated with abnormal vascular leakage and tractional retinal detachment, and neovascular glaucoma is caused by retinal neovascularization. Such ocular vascular diseases are caused by vascular cell aging and vascular damage associated with lifestyle-related diseases including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. In the present study, we investigated molecular mechanisms in such vascular deficiencies using vascular cell biology methodology, and we propose novel strategies for the treatment of such vascular diseases. Along with aging, oxidative stress and physical stress, such as mechanical stretch, continuously and directly insult vascular cells. Such stress induces apoptosis by intracellular signaling through stress kinases in cultured retinal vascular cells. Inhibition of such stress kinases could be an effective treatment to protect the vascular cells against age-related damage. In a retinal vascular developmental model, pericyte loss causes pathology mimicking macular edema and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Angiopoietin 1 (Ang 1) secreted by pericytes suppresses oxidative stress-induced intracellular signaling through stress kinases linked to cell apoptosis and normalizes such retinal pathology. This suggests that the paracrine action of Ang 1 in the pericytes is necessary to sustain normal retinal vasculature, and that Ang 1-triggered intracellular signaling is useful for the treatment of vascular cell pathology associated with pericyte loss. In diabetic retinopathy and retinal vein occlusion, retinal vessels regress along with retinal vascular cell apoptosis, and the retina becomes ischemic followed by pathological retinal neovascularization. VEGF has been recognized as a predominant factor to induce the ischemic retinal neovascularization. We found that retinal vascular cells have a characteristic pattern in VEGF receptor expression, which causes vascular pathology more frequently in the retina than in other organs. Neuropilin 1 (NRP 1), which enhances VEGF receptor function, is abundantly expressed in the retinal endothelial cells and is upregulated by VEGF itself and by hypoxia to regulate a positive feedback mechanism in retinal neovascularization. This receptor could be a unique target for retina-specific therapy. Lifestyle-related diseases increase along with aging and have further increased due to changes in Japanese lifestyle imitating that of Western countries. We found that the renin-angiotensin system which regulates hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, and adipocytokines which are abnormally secreted in obesity, act as proangiogenic factors. Regulation of such lifestyle-related disease factors is important for the treatment of retinal vascular diseases. Finally, we found that erythropoietin is an ischemia-induced angiogenic factor that acts independently and as potently as VEGF in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Our study utilizing human vitreous samples demonstrates that the VEGF level is particularly high and strongly associated with angiogenic activity in PDR patients. The potential of VEGF inhibitors has recently been recognized in clinical applications. The manipulation of each angiogenic factor and adipocytokine that we report here could become potential therapy in the near future.",

    "abstract": "We investigated whether the substitution of the fatty acid moiety in oleoyl-estrone (OE) by conjugated linoleic acid, i.e. conjugated linoleoyl-estrone (cLE) may help improve the antiobesity effects of OE. Overweight (17% fat) male rats were treated for 10 days with oral OE or cLE (10 nmol/g per day) and compared with controls receiving only the oily vehicle. Rat weight and food intake were measured daily. After killing by decapitation, body composition and main plasma parameters were analysed. cLE induced marked decreases in body weight, energy intake, carcass energy and body lipid, whilst sparing protein; the effects were not significantly different from those obtained with OE. Energy expenditure was unchanged, but energy intake decreased to 46% (OE) or 55% (cLE) of controls; whole body energy decreased by 29% (OE) or 24% (cLE) in the 10-day period studied. Plasma composition showed almost identical decreases in glucose and cholesterol elicited by OE and cLE, with a more marked decrease in triacylglycerols by OE and no effect of either on NEFA. OE decreased leptin and insulin levels, but the effects of cLE were more marked on both, with similar decreases in adiponectin. It can be concluded that cLE is a new drug of the OE family; its overall effects on energy were akin to those of OE, albeit fractionally less effective at the single dose tested. However, this lower potency on lipid mobilisation does not affect other effects, such as powerful hypercholesterolemic effects or the modulation of adiponectin. And last, but not least, cLE seems to produce a more marked decrease in leptin and insulin than OE, which may reflect a coordinate action of the conjugated linoleic acid moiety and the OE effect on target tissues. If that were the case, cLE may constitute an improvement over OE in its action on insulin resistance.",

    "title": "leptin-induced growth stimulation of breast cancer cells involves recruitment of histone acetyltransferases and mediator complex to CYCLIN D1 promoter via activation of Stat3.",
    "abstract": "Numerous epidemiological studies documented that obesity is a risk factor for breast cancer development in postmenopausal women. Leptin, the key player in the regulation of energy balance and body weight control also acts as a growth factor on certain organs in both normal and disease state. In this study, we analyzed the role of leptin and the molecular mechanism(s) underlying its action in breast cancer cells that express both short and long isoforms of leptin receptor. Leptin increased MCF7 cell population in the S-phase of the cell cycle along with a robust increase in CYCLIN D1 expression. Also, leptin induced Stat3-phosphorylation-dependent proliferation of MCF7 cells as blocking Stat3 phosphorylation with a specific inhibitor, AG490, abolished leptin-induced proliferation. Using deletion constructs of CYCLIN D1 promoter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we show that leptin induced increase in CYCLIN D1 promoter activity is mediated through binding of activated Stat3 at the Stat binding sites and changes in histone acetylation and methylation. We also show specific involvement of coactivator molecules, histone acetyltransferase SRC1, and mediator complex in leptin-mediated regulation of CYCLIN D1 promoter. Importantly, silencing of SRC1 and Med1 abolished the leptin induced increase in CYCLIN D1 expression and MCF7 cell proliferation. Intriguingly, recruitment of both SRC1 and Med1 was dependent on phosphorylated Stat3 as AG490 treatment inhibited leptin-induced recruitment of these coactivators to CYCLIN D1 promoter. Our data suggest that CYCLIN D1 may be a target gene for leptin mediated growth stimulation of breast cancer cells and molecular mechanisms involve activated Stat3-mediated recruitment of distinct coactivator complexes.",

    "title": "Electrophysiological study on the effects of leptin in rat dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus.",
    "abstract": "Immunoreactivity of leptin receptor (Ob-R) has been detected in rat dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMNV). Here, we confirmed the presence of Ob-R immunoreactivity on retrograde-labeled parasympathetic preganglionic neurons in the DMNV of neonatal rats. The present study investigated the effects of leptin on DMNV neurons, including parasympathetic preganglionic neurons, by using whole cell patch-clamp recording technique in brain stem slices of neonatal rats. Leptin (30-300 nM) induced membrane depolarization and hyperpolarization, respectively, in 14 and 15 out of 80 DMNV neurons tested. Both leptin-induced inward and outward currents persisted in the presence of TTX, indicating that leptin affected DNMV neurons postsynaptically. The current-voltage (I-V) curve of leptin-induced inward currents is characterized by negative slope conductance and has an average reversal potential of -90 +/- 3 mV. The reversal potential of the leptin-induced inward current was shifted to a more positive potential level in a high-potassium medium. These results indicate that a decrease in potassium conductance is likely the main ionic mechanism underlying the leptin-induced depolarization. On the other hand, the I-V curve of leptin-induced outward currents is characterized by positive slope conductance and has an average reversal potential of -88 +/- 3 mV, suggesting that an increase in potassium conductance may underlie leptin-induced hyperpolarization. Most of the leptin-responsive DMNV neurons were identified as being parasympathetic preganglionic neurons. These results suggest that the DMNV is one of the central target sites of leptin, and leptin can regulate parasympathetic outflow from the DMNV by directly acting on the parasympathetic preganglionic neurons of the DMNV.",

    "abstract": "To examine the insulin sensitizing effects of a novel alpha-methyl-alpha- phenoxylpropionate derivative YY20 in insulin-sensitive cell lines. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) agonist bioactivities of YY20 were detected by a preadipocyte differentiation assay. RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis were used to detect the expression of the target gene or protein. The effects of YY20 on insulin-mediated glucose consumption were determined in the HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma line. YY20 could enhance the differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes and upregulate the gene expression of PPAR gamma 2, as well as the protein expression of insulin receptor substrate- 1 (IRS-1), glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4), and adiponectin (ACRP30). The effects on GLUT4 and ACRP30 could be reversed by the PPAR gamma inhibitor SR-202. Furthermore, YY20 efficiently reduced glucose consumptions in HepG2 cells after 24 h culture, and the effects were related to insulin and YY20 concentrations. YY20, a potential insulin-sensitizing agent like rosiglitazone, could enhance glucose consumption in HepG2 cells in a concentration- and insulindependent manner. It may improve the insulin resistance associated with type 2 diabetes.",

    "title": "Upregulation of leptin pathway correlates with abnormal expression of SERCA2a, phospholamban and the endothelin pathway in heart failure and reversal by CPU86017.",
    "abstract": "Emerging evidence indicates that leptin may be a potential new target in chronic heart failure (CHF) treatment. We hypothesized that hyperleptinemia may correlate with abnormal expression of SERCA2a, PLB (phospholamban), and the endothelin (ET) pathway in CHF. An activated ET pathway is involved in CHF that is suppressed by CPU86017 (p-chlorobenzyltetrahydroberberine chloride), a complex class III antiarrhythmic agent with an antioxidant effect. Thus, relief of CHF may be mediated by a reversal of abnormalities of the leptin system, the ET-reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathway, SERCA2a, and PLB by CPU86017. CHF was produced by coronary artery ligation for 6 weeks in rats. The rats were divided into 3 groups: sham, CHF untreated, and CHF+CPU86017 (4 mg/kg per day, s.c.). Hemodynamic changes, cardiac morphology, serum biochemistry, messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein expression of the leptin pathway, ET pathway, and redox were measured. In CHF rats, hemodynamic abnormalities, cardiac remodeling, and histological changes with features of cardiac failure were associated with hyperlipidemia accompanied by oxidative stress and upregulated OB-Rb, ECE, pp-ET-1, ET(A)R, and ET(B)R mRNA expression in the myocardium. Protein expression of leptin and ET(A)R in the myocardium was markedly increased in CHF rats. An activated leptin pathway was associated with downregulation of SERCA2a and upregulation of PLB in mRNA and protein expression in CHF. CPU86017 downregulated the leptin system and reversed the above changes in the myocardium. An activated leptin pathway correlates with abnormal expression of SERCA2a and PLB and an activated ET-ROS system in the affected myocardium. The multi-ion-channel-blocking and antioxidative effects of CPU86017 downregulate the leptin pathway and ET system, resulting in reversal of the abnormalities of expression of SERCA2a and PLB and cardiac performance in CHF.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is often complicated by hypertension, and both conditions are risk factors for atherosclerosis. Leptin has attracted attention as a possible cause of hypertension in obese persons. We investigated the effect of a slow-release alpha1-receptor blocker, bunazosin hydrochloride, on leptin levels and insulin resistance in obese hypertensive patients with hyperleptinemia. The subjects were 17 patients (12 men and 5 women aged 56.1 +/- 12.2 years) with essential hypertension who were not receiving alpha1-receptor blockers. They had a body mass index (BMI) &gt; or = 25 kg/m2 and a plasma leptin concentration &gt; or = 5 ng/ml. They received oral therapy with bunazosin hydrochloride at doses of up to 9 mg/day. The plasma leptin concentration, body weight, blood pressure, heart rate, fasting blood glucose, plasma insulin concentration, and free fatty acid level were compared between before and after treatment. Although there was no significant change of BMI, there was a significant decrease of plasma leptin after treatment (10.6 +/- 5.4 ng/ml vs. 8.7 +/- 3.4 ng/ml, p = 0.0128), as well as a significant decrease of plasma insulin (9.8 +/- 4.8 microU/ml vs. 8.1 +/- 4.6 microU/ml, p = 0.0494) and HOMA-R (2.9 +/- 2.1 vs. 2.2 +/- 1.5, p = 0.0237). In conclusion, bunazosin hydrochloride reduced the plasma leptin level and improved insulin resistance in hypertensive patients with obesity and hyperleptinemia.",

In addition, leptin can stimulate mitogenic and angiogenic processes in peripheral organs. Because leptin levels are elevated in obese individuals and excess body weight has been shown to increase breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women, attempts have been made to evaluate whether leptin can promote breast cancer. Data obtained in cell and animal models and analyses of human breast cancer biopsies indeed suggest such an involvement. Furthermore, a recent report clearly shows that targeting leptin signaling may reduce mammary carcinogenesis. Thus, leptin should become a new attractive target in breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Src-homology-2 (SH2)-B, a Janus tyrosine kinase 2-interacting protein, has been identified recently as a key regulator of leptin and insulin sensitivity, glucose homeostasis, and body weight in mice. The aim of this study was to determine whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human SH2B gene are associated with these variables. A tagging SNP (tSNP), Ala484Thr (rs7498665), was selected to represent five common SNPs (minor allele frequency &gt; 0.05) in perfect linkage disequilibrium in a 16-kb region encompassing the SH2B gene. The tSNP was genotyped in 2455 white female twins (mean age, 47.4 +/- 12.6 years) from the St. Thomas' United Kingdom Adult Twin Registry (Twins United Kingdom). Ala484Thr (minor allele frequency, 0.38) was associated with serum leptin, total fat, waist circumference, and body weight (P = 0.02 to 0.04). The coding SNP has no predicted effect on protein structure or function and is likely to be in linkage disequilibrium with an as-yet unidentified functional variant in the SH2B gene. Our results support a role for SH2-B in modulating the regulation of body weight and fat by leptin in this female population. If SH2-B signaling is attenuated in diet-induced obesity, it could become a target for drug-induced leptin sensitization.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a well-defined risk factor for the development of insulin resistance in target tissues, such as skeletal muscle, and thus type 2 diabetes. This may occur due to endocrine effects mediated by adipokines including leptin, the product of the obese (ob) gene, whose circulating levels positively correlate with body mass index. Induction of suppressor of cytokine-3 (SOCS-3) protein expression has been implicated as a possible mechanism of leptin-induced insulin resistance. Here, we show that treatment of rat skeletal muscle cells with leptin activated the SOCS-3 gene promoter and caused a time-dependent increase in both SOCS-3 mRNA and protein content. Confocal microscopy demonstrated increased co-localization of SOCS-3 with insulin receptor in leptin-treated cells and we confirmed a direct interaction between these two proteins by showing increased coimmunoprecipitation of SOCS-3 and insulin receptor after exposure of cells to leptin. However, the expected functional consequences were not observed, as we saw no change in basal or insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and phosphorylation of GSK3beta, Akt (T308 and S473) or ERK1/2. In summary, leptin induced SOCS-3 expression and its association with the insulin receptor in rat skeletal muscle cells but functional significance of this increase was not apparent upon measuring glucose uptake.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is associated with increased levels of leptin. The mitogenic actions of leptin have been identified in various cell types. Because obesity may be a risk factor for colonic cancer, the proliferative and antiapoptotic effects of leptin on colonic cancer cells and the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) signalling were investigated. Three human colonic cancer cell lines (T(84), HT29/Cl.19A and Caco-2) were treated with leptin. Cell proliferation was measured using the XTT colorimetric assay and apoptosis by a cell death enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Inhibitors of MAPK and PI3-K were used to evaluate the role of these signalling pathways. Phosphorylation of the downstream components extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and Akt was detected by western blotting. Leptin increased cell number in all cell lines in a dose-dependent manner and reduced the number of apoptotic cells in a cell line-dependent manner. Leptin also caused ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation. Pretreatment with inhibitors of MAPK and PI3-K inhibited these responses, attenuated the mitogenic action of leptin and abolished its antiapoptotic effects. Chronic increases in leptin concentration may enhance the growth of colonic cancers via MAPK and PI3-K pathways. These effects of leptin could provide a link between obesity and colonic cancer, and may represent a target for anticancer drug development.",

We found that resistin-expressing mice exhibited impaired insulin secretory response to glucose. In addition, in vitro treatment with resistin for 1 day induced insulin resistance in pancreatic islets and impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by elevating insulin release at basal glucose (2.8 mM) and suppressing insulin release at stimulatory glucose (8.3 mM). In addition, resistin inhibited insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt in islets as well as other insulin target organs. Furthermore, resistin induced SOCS-3 expression in beta-cells. In conclusion, resistin induces insulin resistance in islet beta-cells at least partly via induction of SOCS-3 expression and reduction of Akt phosphorylation and impairs glucose-induced insulin secretion.",

Comprehensive analysis of the mechanism of adiponectin action may allow us to elucidate the etiology of metabolic syndrome associated diseases including diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, where dysfunction of adiponectin may contribute to pathogenesis of diseases. While regulation of adiponectin gene expression or secretion remains an interesting topic in studies of cell metabolism, further intensive studies are necessary to illustrate the molecular mechanisms.

    "title": "Adiponectin modulates the glycogen synthase kinase-3beta/beta-catenin signaling pathway and attenuates mammary tumorigenesis of MDA-MB-231 cells in nude mice.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin is an adipokine that has pleiotropic beneficial roles in systemic insulin resistance and inflammation. Several recent clinical studies suggest that low serum levels of adiponectin are associated with increased risks of breast cancer. Here, we investigated the direct effects of adiponectin on breast cancer development in vitro and in vivo. Our results showed that adiponectin significantly attenuated the proliferations of two typical human breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231 and T47D, in a cell type-specific manner. Further analysis revealed that adiponectin could induce apoptosis and arrest the cell cycle progression at G(0)-G(1) phase in MDA-MB-231 cells. Prolonged treatment with adiponectin in this cell line blocked serum-induced phosphorylation of Akt and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), suppressed intracellular accumulation of beta-catenin and its nuclear activities, and consequently reduced expression of cyclin D1. Adiponectin-mediated suppression of cyclin D1 expression and attenuation of cell proliferation was abrogated by the GSK-3beta inhibitor lithium chloride. These results suggest that the inhibitory role of adiponectin on MDA-MB-231 cell growth might be attributed to its suppressive effects on the GSK-3beta/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Furthermore, our in vivo study showed that both supplementation of recombinant adiponectin and adenovirus-mediated overexpression of this adipokine substantially reduced the mammary tumorigenesis of MDA-MB-231 cells in female nude mice. Taken together, these data support the role of adiponectin as a negative regulator of breast cancer development and also suggest that adiponectin might represent a novel therapeutic target for this disease.",

    "title": "Modulation of food reward by adiposity signals.",
    "abstract": "Extensive historical evidence from the drug abuse literature has provided support for the concept that there is functional communication between central nervous system (CNS) circuitries which subserve reward/motivation, and the regulation of energy homeostasis. This concept is substantiated by recent studies that map anatomical pathways, or which demonstrate that hormones and neurotransmitters associated with energy homeostasis regulation can directly modulate reward and motivation behaviors. Studies from our laboratory have focused specifically on the candidate adiposity hormones, insulin and leptin, and show that these hormones can decrease performance in behavioral paradigms that assess the rewarding or motivating properties of food. Additionally we and others have provided evidence that the ventral tegmental area may be one direct target for these effects, and we are currently exploring other potential anatomical targets. Finally, we are beginning to explore the interaction between adiposity signals, chronic maintenance diet of rats, and different types of food rewards to more closely simulate the current food environments of Westernized societies including the U.S. We propose that future studies of food reward should include a more complex environment in the experimental design that takes into account abundance and variety of rewarding foods, psychological stressors, and choices of reward modalities.",

    "title": "Emerging therapeutic strategies for obesity.",
    "abstract": "The rising tide of obesity is one of the most pressing health issues of our time, yet existing medicines to combat the problem are disappointingly limited in number and effectiveness. Fortunately, a recent burgeoning of mechanistic insights into the neuroendocrine regulation of body weight provides an expanding list of molecular targets for novel, rationally designed antiobesity pharmaceuticals. In this review, we articulate a set of conceptual principles that we feel could help prioritize among these molecules in the development of obesity therapeutics, based on an understanding of energy homeostasis. We focus primarily on central targets, highlighting selected strategies to stimulate endogenous catabolic signals or inhibit anabolic signals. Examples of the former approach include methods to enhance central leptin signaling through intranasal leptin delivery, use of superpotent leptin-receptor agonists, and mechanisms to increase leptin sensitivity by manipulating SOCS-3, PTP-1B, ciliary neurotrophic factor, or simply by first losing weight with traditional interventions. Techniques to augment signaling by neurochemical mediators of leptin action that lie downstream of at least some levels of obesity-associated leptin resistance include activation of melanocortin receptors or 5-HT2C and 5-HT1B receptors. We also describe strategies to inhibit anabolic molecules, such as neuropeptide Y, melanin-concentrating hormone, ghrelin, and endocannabinoids. Modulation of gastrointestinal satiation and hunger signals is discussed as well. As scientists continue to provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms governing body weight, the future looks bright for development of new and better antiobesity medications to be used with diet and exercise to facilitate substantial weight loss.",

    "abstract": "Rimonabant is the first drug to target the endocannabinoid (CB) pathway by inhibiting the actions of anandamide and 2-archidonyl-glycerol on CB1 receptors. This review gives an overview of rimonabant and the CB system and how this system relates to obesity. Rimonabant blocks the central effects of this neurotransmitter pathway involved in obesity and weight control and also blocks the direct effects of CBs on adipocyte and hepatocyte metabolism. Blockade of CB1 receptors leads to a decrease in appetite and also has direct actions in adipose tissue and the liver to improve glucose, fat and cholesterol metabolism so improving insulin resistance, triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and in some patients, blood pressure. The Rimonabant in Obesity (RIO) trials have shown that rimonabant induces weight loss &gt; 5% in 30-40% of patients and &gt; 10% in 10-20% above both a dietary run-in and long-term hypocaloric management over a 2 year period with a low level of drug-related side effects. Rimonabant therapy is associated with an extra 8-10% increase in HDL-C and a 10-30% reduction in triglycerides and improvements in insulin resistance, glycaemic control in patients with diabetes and also adipokines and cytokines including C-reactive protein over hypocaloric diet therapy. In addition rimonabant abolishes the weight gain associated with smoking cessation and improves the chances of quitting smoking. Thus rimonabant has major effects on both the metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk factors thus has the potential to reduce the risks of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease associated with the cardiometabolic phenotype.",

    "title": "Alcohol intake modulates hormonal activity of adipose tissue.",
    "abstract": "White adipose tissue (WAT) is now recognized as a highly active metabolic tissue and important endocrine organ producing numerous peptides and proteins with broad biological activity. The term adipokines has been coined to refer to a series of adipocyte-derived biologically active molecules, which may influence the function as well as the structural integrity of other tissues. Adipokines are implicated in control of food intake, energy balance and body weight (leptin), glucose homeostasis (e.g., adiponectin, resistin, adiponutrin), lipid metabolism (e.g., retinol-binding protein, cholesterolester transfer protein), angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF), fibrinolytic system (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 PAI-1), pro- and anti-inflammatory effects (e.g., tumor necrosis factor-alpha TNF-alpha, interleukin-6 IL-6) or sexual development and reproduction (leptin). Alterations of WAT mass in obesity or lipoatrophy effect the production of most adipose secreted factors. Besides others, alcohol consumption affects also hormonal system leading to non-physiological increase/decrease of hormone gene expression and plasma hormone concentrations appearing as final poor or stronger effects on target tissues. As mentioned above, white adipose tissue is important endocrine organ, so alcohol intake can alter also adipokines expression in WAT and adipokines plasma levels and in this way it can affect the adipokine-targeted tissues and their functions.",

Many clinical studies improving glycemic control by insulin and oral drugs were not demonstrating enough prevention for diabetic macroangiopathy to improve life prognosis. Insulin resistance is now considered to be major pathogenesis for diabetic macroangiopathy. The agents that improve insulin resistance, such as metformin and pioglitazone, have multiple effects to improve glucose and lipid metabolism by increasing sensitivity for insulin without increasing insulin secretion and exert anti-atherogenic properties resulting in preventing development of atherosclerosis. Some clinical studies such as UKPDS 34 and PROactive demonstrated preventive effects of these agents for diabetic macroangiopathy.",

    "abstract": "The lipodystrophic syndrome (LD) is a disorder resulting from selective damage of adipose tissue by antiretroviral drugs included in therapy controlling human-immunodeficiency-virus-1. In the therapy cocktail the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) contribute to the development of this syndrome. Cellular target of NRTI was identified as the mitochondrial polymerase-gamma and their toxicity described as a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion resulting in a mitochondrial cytopathy and involved in fat redistribution. No mechanisms offer explanation whatsoever for the lipo-atrophic and lipo-hypertrophic phenotype of LD. To understand the occurrence we proposed that the pO2 (oxygen partial pressure) could be a key factor in the development of the LD. For the first time, we report here differential effects of NRTIs on human adipose cells depending on pO2 conditions. We showed that the hypoxia conditions could alter adipogenesis process by modifying expression of adipocyte makers as leptin and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPARgamma and inhibiting triglyceride (TG) accumulation in adipocytes. Toxicity of NRTI followed on adipose cells in culture under normoxia versus hypoxia conditions showed, differential effects of drugs on mtDNA of these cells depending on pO2 conditions. Moreover, NRTI-treated adipocytes were refractory to the inhibition of adipogenesis under hypoxia. Finally, our hypothesis that variations of pO2 could exist between adipose tissue from anatomical origins was supported by staining of the hypoxic-induced angiopoietin ANGPTL4 depended on the location of fat. Toxicity of NRTIs have been shown to be opposite on human adipose cells depending on the oxygen availability. These data suggest that the LD phenotype may be a differential consequence of NRTI effects, depending on the metabolic status of the targeted adipose tissues and provide new insights into the opposite effects of antiretroviral treatment, as observed for the lipo-atrophic and lipo-hypertrophic phenotype characteristic of LD.",

    "title": "Drug residues store in the body following cessation of use: impacts on neuroendocrine balance and behavior--use of the Hubbard sauna regimen to remove toxins and restore health.",
    "abstract": "For decades, scientists have investigated the environmental and human health effects of synthetic chemicals. A growing body of research has illuminated the spectrum of consequences deriving from our reliance these substances and their proliferation in air, water, soil and the food chain. Of particular concern is the fact that residues of many man-made chemicals are now detectible in virtually every person. A key to a chemical's tendency to persist in tissues once it has entered the body is its lipophilicity. Substances that are poorly soluble in water and quite soluble in fat have relatively free access, via lipid-rich cellular membranes, to the cells of all organs including the ability to cross the blood-brain and placental barriers. Substantial data exist demonstrating that in addition to pollutants, drugs and their metabolites dispose to tissues high in fat content, including brain and adipose. While their characteristic lipophilicity permits drugs and medications to reach target tissues, thereby producing therapeutic effects in the present, current perceptions of risk may be ignoring the possibility that adipose accumulations of illicit drugs and pharmaceuticals may lead to future patterns of ill health similar to those associated with exposure to other categories of xenobiotic chemicals. Empirical data are beginning to characterize the myriad regulatory functions of adipose hormones, including roles in cravings, cognitive function, energy level, and inflammation as well as changes in adipose hormone levels associated with drug use. Included in this data are the observation that a rehabilitative treatment intervention introduced by L. Ron Hubbard in 1978 to aid in the broad elimination of chemicals from body stores improves symptoms common to both chemical exposure and drug addiction. The regimen, which includes exercise, sauna bathing, and vitamin and mineral supplementation, is utilized by nearly 70 drug rehabilitation and medical practices in over 20 countries. At present, much more is unknown than is known regarding long-term drug retention and effects. This subject deserves careful evaluation given its potential implications for health and chronic illnesses of poorly defined etiology (such as chronic fatigue syndrome), as well as drug abuse prevention, drug rehabilitation, forensic and legal areas.",

    "abstract": "AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an enzyme that works as a fuel gauge which becomes activated in situations of energy consumption. AMPK functions to restore cellular ATP levels by modifying diverse metabolic and cellular pathways. In the skeletal muscle, AMPK is activated during exercise and is involved in contraction-stimulated glucose transport and fatty acid oxidation. In the heart, AMPK activity increases during ischaemia and functions to sustain ATP, cardiac function and myocardial viability. In the liver, AMPK inhibits the production of glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides and stimulates fatty acid oxidation. Recent studies have shown that AMPK is involved in the mechanism of action of metformin and thiazolidinediones, and the adipocytokines leptin and adiponectin. These data, along with evidence that pharmacological activation of AMPK in vivo improves blood glucose homeostasis, cholesterol concentrations and blood pressure in insulin-resistant rodents, make this enzyme an attractive pharmacological target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, ischaemic heart disease and other metabolic diseases.",

Thereafter, the dose was 1500 mg for another 6 weeks. Adiponectin increased by 54% and 94%, respectively, resistin was lowered only moderately, and leptin not at all.

    "abstract": "Adiponectin has recently received a great deal of attention due to its beneficial effects on insulin resistance and metabolic disorders. One of the mechanisms through which adiponectin exerts such effects involves an increase in fatty acid oxidation in muscle and liver. In the present study, we demonstrate that 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) are involved in the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)alpha by adiponectin in muscle cells. Adiponectin increases the transcriptional activity of PPARalpha and the expression of its target genes, including ACO, CPT1, and FABP3 in C2C12 myotubes. These effects were suppressed by the overexpression of a dominant-negative form of AMPK. Moreover, chemical inhibitors of AMPK and p38 MAPK potently repressed fatty acid oxidation and the induction of PPARalpha target gene expression by adiponectin. Interestingly, araA, an AMPK inhibitor, prevented the activation of p38 MAPK, whereas SB203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, did not affect AMPK activation, suggesting that p38 MAPK is a downstream signaling factor of AMPK. Taken together, these results suggest that adiponectin stimulates fatty acid oxidation in muscle cells by the sequential activation of AMPK, p38 MAPK, and PPARalpha.",

    "abstract": "Hepatic steatosis is defined by an increased content of hepatocellular lipids (HCLs) and is frequently observed in insulin-resistant states including type 2 diabetes mellitus. A dietary excess of saturated fat contributes significantly to HCL accumulation. Elevated HCL levels mainly account for hepatic insulin resistance, which is probably mediated by partitioning of free fatty acids to the liver (fat overflow) and by an imbalance of adipocytokines (decreased adiponectin and/or increased proinflammatory cytokines). Both free fatty acids and adipocytokines activate inflammatory pathways that include protein kinase C, the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 and can thereby accelerate the progression of hepatic steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy has made it possible to quantify HCL concentrations and to detect even small changes in these concentrations in clinical settings. Moderately hypocaloric, fat-reduced diets can decrease HCL levels by approximately 40-80% in parallel with loss of up to 8% of body weight. Treatment with thiazolidinediones (e.g. pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) reduces HCL levels by 30-50% by modulating insulin sensitivity and endocrine function of adipose tissue in type 2 diabetes. Metformin improves hepatic insulin action without affecting HCL levels, whereas insulin infusion for 67 h increases HCL levels by approximately 18%; furthermore, HCL levels positively correlate with the insulin dosage in insulin-treated type 2 diabetes. In conclusion, liver fat is a critical determinant of metabolic fluxes and inflammatory processes, thereby representing an important therapeutic target in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

    "abstract": "JTP-426467 was identified as a result of screening in search of selective antagonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). We examined whether JTP-426467 functioned as a PPARgamma antagonist in vitro and in vivo and investigated physiological effects of JTP-426467. The effect of JTP-426467 as a PPARgamma antagonist was studied in a cell-based reporter assay and an adipocyte differentiation assay. Target mRNA expression levels were determined by branched DNA (bDNA) assay. To examine the effects as a PPARgamma antagonist in vivo, a competitive study between JTP-426467 and BRL49653 (rosiglitazone), a PPARgamma agonist, was performed using KK-Ay mice. The effects of JTP-426467 alone after administration to KK-Ay mice were also explored. JTP-426467 antagonized PPARgamma activity in a reporter assay system, but not PPARalpha. JTP-426467 inhibited the expression of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) mRNA, an adipocyte-abundant gene, but not PPARgamma itself or cyclophilin mRNA (as constitutive mRNA), and also suppressed triglyceride accumulation in differentiated stromal vascular fraction cells (SVFs). JTP-426467 antagonized PPARgamma agonistic action by BRL49653 in KK-Ay mice on high-fat diet, in terms of plasma glucose, body weight gain and interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) weight. JTP-426467 alone inhibited body weight gain and decreased plasma leptin level in KK-Ay mice. JTP-426467 acted as a pure and potent PPARgamma antagonist in vitro. Interestingly, JTP-426467 completely antagonized the effects of PPARgamma agonist BRL49653 in an obese diabetic model. JTP-426467 may be a useful tool for the study of PPARgamma in biological and physiological function.",

    "title": "Insulin modulates the secretion of proteins from mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes: a role for transcriptional regulation of processing.",
    "abstract": "Under conditions of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, fat cells are subjected to increased levels of insulin, which may have a major impact on the secretion of adipokines. Using transcriptomics and proteomics, we investigated how insulin affects the transcription and protein secretion profile of mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We found that insulin has a significant impact on protein secretion of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. However, transcription is not the major regulation point for these secreted proteins. For extracellular matrix components, our data suggest that the mRNA level of processing enzymes, but not of target proteins, is the regulating point at which insulin stimulates secretion and function of the relevant proteins. Among these enzymes, we report a novel finding, namely that sulfatase 2 gene is regulated by insulin, which may induce a functional change in cultured adipocytes. We propose that enhancement of protein processing and secretion rather than transcription of the secreted protein genes is part of the strategic role of insulin in the induction of cellular responses.",

Since niacin acts on adipocytes, we investigated its impact on adipokines and on some functions attributed to adipokines. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study 30 men with the metabolic syndrome were treated for 6 weeks with 1500 mg extended-release niacin (n=20) or a placebo (n=10). Adiponectin increased by 56% (p&lt;0.001) and leptin by 26.8% (p&lt;0.012). Resistin, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and high sensitive CRP remained unchanged. In spite of the increase in adiponectin there was no improvement in endothelial function. The HOMA index actually deteriorated by 42% (p&lt;0.014). Short-term treatment with extended-release niacin causes a pronounced increase in adiponectin but fails to improve atheroprotective functions attributed to adiponectin, such as insulin sensitivity, anti-inflammation and endothelial function.",

    "title": "Role of insulin, adipocyte hormones, and nutrient-sensing pathways in regulating fuel metabolism and energy homeostasis: a nutritional perspective of diabetes, obesity, and cancer.",
    "abstract": "Traditionally, nutrients such as glucose and amino acids have been viewed as substrates for the generation of high-energy molecules and as precursors for the biosynthesis of macromolecules. However, it is now apparent that nutrients also function as signaling molecules in functionally diverse signal transduction pathways. Glucose and amino acids trigger signaling cascades that regulate various aspects of fuel and energy metabolism and control the growth, proliferation, and survival of cells. Here, we provide a functional and regulatory overview of three well-established nutrient signaling pathways-the hexosamine signaling pathway, the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathway, and the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway. Nutrient signaling pathways are interconnected, coupled to insulin signaling, and linked to the release of metabolic hormones from adipose tissue. Thus, nutrient signaling pathways do not function in isolation. Rather, they appear to serve as components of a larger metabolic regulatory network that controls fuel and energy metabolism (at the cell, tissue, and whole-body levels) and links nutrient availability with cell growth and proliferation. Understanding the diverse roles of nutrients and delineating nutrient signaling pathways should facilitate drug discovery research and the search for novel therapeutic compounds to prevent and treat various human diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and cancer.",

    "title": "An autocrine role for leptin in mediating the cardiomyocyte hypertrophic effects of angiotensin II and endothelin-1.",
    "abstract": "Leptin is a 16 kDa product of the obesity gene secreted primarily by adipocytes. We recently identified cardiomyocytes as a target for the direct hypertrophic effects of leptin and suggested that leptin may be a biological link between obesity and cardiovascular pathologies. Activation of the renin-angiotensin and endothelin systems is associated with development of cardiovascular diseases and plasma renin levels are elevated in obese individuals. We therefore determined possible interaction between these factors in mediating hypertrophy in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. Treatment for 24 h with leptin (3.1 nM), angiotensin II (100 nM) or endothelin-1 (ET-1, 10 nM) significantly increased cell area by 37%, 36% and 35%, respectively and significantly increased gene expression of myosin light chain-2 and alpha-skeletal actin as well as leucine incorporation. The hypertrophic effects of all three agents were prevented by leptin and a leptin triple mutant receptor antagonist whereas the AT(1) receptor blocker (Sar1-lle(8))-Ang II or the ET(A) receptor blocker BQ123 was ineffective against leptin-induced hypertrophy. Both angiotensin II and ET-1 significantly increased leptin levels in the culture medium by fivefold. Moreover, both angiotensin II and ET-1 increased the gene expression of the short form (OBRa) by 180% and long form (OBRb) of leptin receptors by 200%, and this increase was abolished by both leptin receptor and leptin antibodies and leptin triple mutant. Although both angiotensin II and ET-1 increased phosphorylation of MAPK (p38, ERK1/2 and JNK) and NF-kappaB, the ability of leptin blockade to attenuate the hypertrophic responses was generally dissociated from these effects suggesting an alternate, yet to be identified cellular pathway mediating this role of leptin. Our studies therefore suggest a novel autocrine function for leptin in mediating the hypertrophic effects of both angiotensin II and ET-1 in cardiac myocytes.",

Leptin, a cytokine-like hormone, plays a role in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases. In this study, we observed significantly increased plasma leptin levels combined with decreased soluble leptin receptor (sOB-R) levels in 18 chronic ITP patients compared with 14 controls. We also demonstrated significantly elevated mRNA expression of long form leptin receptor (Ob-Rb) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from chronic ITP patients. Treatment with recombinant leptin or serum with high leptin levels enhanced in vitro secretion of IgG antiplatelet antibodies by splenocytes and PBMCs from patients with chronic ITP. After depletion of CD4(+) T cells from splenocytes, leptin lost this function. Further studies showed that leptin could increase platelet reactive T cells. These findings suggest that leptin may be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic ITP and might offer a potential target for the treatment of this disease.",

    "abstract": "HIV infection requires the continuous administration of antiretroviral molecules. Individual molecules belonging to the two main classes, protease inhibitors (PIs) and nucleoside analogues inhibitors of the viral reverse transcriptase (NRTIs) have been shown to be involved in deleterious side effects collectively called the lipodystrophy syndrome. This syndrome associates altered body fat repartition (peripheral lipoatrophy and visceral fat hypertrophy) and metabolic alterations (dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and diabetes). The pathophysiology of these alterations is complex but different studies argue for adipose tissue being a target of some PIs and NRTIs acting through different mechanisms. NRTIs are able to induce mitochondrial dysfonction and to modify adipocyte phenotype and adipose tissue pattern of secretion of cytokines (TNFalpha, IL-6) and other adipokines (adiponectin, leptin) probably through the production of reactive oxygen species. Some PIs also act on adipocyte, alter its differentiation and insulin sensitivity and also the pattern of secretion of adipokines by adipose tissue. These hypotheses could explain the loss of adipose tissue, while the mechanisms of visceral fat hypertrophy remain speculative. Since some adipokines and the free fatty acids released by adipocytes play a major role in the control of liver and muscles insulin sensitivity, these alterations are probably involved in the metabolic alterations seen in the patients. In addition, lipodystrophic adipose tissue could be involved in the increased lesions of atherogenesis and steatohepatitis presented by these patients. The treatment of lipodystrophy remains difficult and, at present, privileges the switch of the more deleterious drugs towards new molecules less aggressive for adipose tissue.",

    "abstract": "The LKB1--&gt;AMPK cascade is switched on by metabolic stresses that either inhibit ATP production (e.g. hypoxia, hypoglycaemia) or that accelerate ATP consumption (e.g. muscle contraction). Any decline in cellular energy status is accompanied by a rise in the cellular AMP: ATP ratio, and this activates AMPK by a complex and sensitive mechanism involving antagonistic binding of the nucleotides to two sites on the regulatory gamma subunits of AMPK. Once activated by metabolic stress, AMPK activates catabolic pathways that generate ATP, while inhibiting cell growth and biosynthesis and other processes that consume ATP. While the AMPK system probably evolved in single-celled eukaryotes to maintain energy balance at the cellular level, in multicellular organisms its role has become adapted so that it is also involved in maintaining whole body energy balance. Thus, it is regulated by hormones and cytokines, especially the adipokines leptin and adiponectin, increasing whole body energy expenditure while regulating food intake. Some hormones may activate AMPK by an LKB1-independent mechanism involving Ca2+/calmodulin dependent protein kinase kinases. Low levels of activation of AMPK are likely to play a role in the current global rise in obesity and Type 2 diabetes, and AMPK is the target for the widely used antidiabetic drug metformin.",

Studies were conducted on meal-trained rats to evaluate the potential physiological relevance of these in vitro findings and the role of Leu in affecting rises in plasma leptin observed after a meal. In the first study, we correlated changes in plasma insulin and Leu to mTOR-signaling pathway activation and plasma leptin at different times during meal feeding. Rapid rises in plasma insulin and Leu, along with mTOR signaling (phosphorylation of eIF4G, S6K1, rpS6, and 4E-BP1) in adipose tissue were observed during the 3-h meal and declined thereafter. Plasma leptin rose more slowly, peaking at 3 h, and was inhibited by rapamycin (0.75 mg/kg) pretreatment. In another experiment, oral Leu or norleucine was provided instead of a meal. Leu and norleucine stimulated a rise in plasma leptin; however, the magnitude was less than the response to a complete meal. In a third study, rats were provided a meal that lacked Leu, branched-chain amino acids, or all amino acids. Stimulation of leptin secretion was reduced approximately 40% in animals provided the Leu-deficient meal. Further reductions were not observed by removing the other amino acids. Thus Leu appears to regulate most of the effects of dietary amino acids on the postprandial rise in plasma leptin but is responsible only for part of the leptin response to meal feeding.",

    "abstract": "Conflicting results have been reported regarding the effect of triiodothyronine (T(3)) on serum leptin and adipose tissue leptin gene expression in human and animals. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of administration of increasing doses of T(3) on serum leptin concentration and on leptin mRNA abundance in white adipose tissue of rats. The results presented in this paper indicate that administration of single different doses of T(3) to euthyroid rats resulted dose dependent increases of serum total T(3) concentrations which are associated with a decrease in white adipose tissue leptin mRNA level. The leptin mRNA level in white adipose tissue was negatively correlated with serum total T(3) concentration (r=-0.8, p&lt;0.001). Like white adipose tissue leptin mRNA level, serum leptin concentration decreased after T(3) administration, and was also negatively correlated with the serum T(3) concentration (r=-0.8, p&lt;0.001). In contrast, administration of T(3) to the same rats led to a significant increase in white adipose tissue expression of the malic enzyme gene (malic enzyme activity and malic enzyme mRNA level), a known target gene for T(3). The results indicate that T(3) exerts a selective inhibitory effect on white adipose tissue leptin gene expression in vivo. A conclusion is that T(3) decreases rat serum leptin concentration by down-regulation of leptin gene expression in white adipose tissue.",

    "title": "Insulin resistance and improvements in signal transduction.",
    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes and obesity are common metabolic disorders characterized by resistance to the actions of insulin to stimulate skeletal muscle glucose disposal. Insulin-resistant muscle has defects at several steps of the insulin-signaling pathway, including decreases in insulin-stimulated insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activation. One approach to increase muscle glucose disposal is to reverse/improve these insulin-signaling defects. Weight loss and thiazolidinediones (TZDs) improve glucose disposal, in part, by increasing insulin-stimulated insulin receptor and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and PI 3-kinase activity. In contrast, physical training and metformin improve whole-body glucose disposal but have minimal effects on proximal insulin-signaling steps. A novel approach to reverse insulin resistance involves inhibition of the stress-activated protein kinase Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). A different strategy to increase muscle glucose disposal is by stimulating insulin-independent glucose transport. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an enzyme that works as a fuel gauge and becomes activated in situations of energy consumption, such as muscle contraction. Several studies have shown that pharmacologic activation of AMPK increases glucose transport in muscle, independent of the actions of insulin. AMPK activation is also involved in the mechanism of action of metformin and adiponectin. Moreover, in the hypothalamus, AMPK regulates appetite and body weight. The effect of AMPK to stimulate muscle glucose disposal and to control appetite makes it an important pharmacologic target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity.",

    "abstract": "The 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a sensor of cellular energy homeostasis well conserved in all eukaryotic cells. AMPK is activated by rising AMP and falling ATP, either by inhibiting ATP production or by accelerating ATP consumption, by a complex mechanism that results in an ultrasensitive response. AMPK is a heterotrimeric enzyme complex consisting of a catalytic subunit alpha and two regulatory subunits beta and gamma. AMP activates the system by binding to the gamma subunit that triggers phosphorylation of the catalytic alpha subunit by the upstream kinases LKB1 and CaMKKbeta. Once activated, it switches on catabolic pathways (such as fatty acid oxidation and glycolysis) and switches off ATP-consuming pathways (such as lipogenesis) both by short-term effect on phosphorylation of regulatory proteins and by long-term effect on gene expression. Dominant mutations in the regulatory gamma subunit isoforms cause hypertrophy of cardiac and skeletal muscle providing a link in human diseases caused by defects in energy metabolism. As well as acting at the level of the individual cell, the system also regulates food intake and energy expenditure at the whole body level, in particular by mediating the effects of adipokines such as leptin and adiponectin. Moreover, the AMPK system is one of the probable target for the anti-diabetic drug metformin and rosiglitazone. The relationship between AMPK activation and beneficial metabolic effects provides the rationale for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Thus, pharmacological AMPK activation may, through signaling, metabolic and gene expression effects, reduce the risk of Type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and cardiac diseases.",

    "abstract": "Histamine-containing neurons and histamine H1 receptors are distributed within the brain and peripheral tissues. The results of physiological and pharmacological studies have revealed that brain histamine and H1 receptors are involved in the regulation of feeding and obesity in rodents. The adipocytokine leptin regulates feeding and obesity, partially through brain histamine. Furthermore, recent studies have provided evidence that regulation of the diurnal rhythm of feeding through H1 receptors is a crucial factor in the development of obesity. Thus, the regulation of H1 receptors is important for the control of energy metabolism, feeding rhythms and obesity in rodents.",

    "title": "Contribution of CB1 blockade to the management of high-risk abdominal obesity.",
    "abstract": "The worldwide increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes represents a tremendous challenge for our healthcare system, especially if we consider that this phenomenon is largely explained by the epidemic of obesity. However, despite the well-recognized increased morbidity and mortality associated with an elevated body weight, there is now more and more evidence highlighting that abdominal adipose tissue is the fat depot that conveys the greatest risk of metabolic complications. This cluster of metabolic abnormalities has been referred to as the metabolic syndrome and this condition is largely the consequence of abdominal obesity, especially when accompanied by a high accumulation of visceral adipose tissue. This cluster of metabolic complications has also been found to be predictive of a substantially increased risk of coronary heart disease beyond the presence of traditional risk factors. Moreover, a moderate weight loss in initially abdominally obese patients is associated with a selective mobilization of visceral adipose tissue, leading to improvements in the metabolic risk profile predictive of a reduced risk of coronary heart disease and of type 2 diabetes. The recent discovery of the endocannabinoid-CB1 receptor system and of its impact on the regulation of energy metabolism represents a significant advance, which will help physicians target abdominal obesity and its related metabolic complications. In this regard, studies have shown that rimonabant therapy (the first developed CB1 blocker) could be useful for the management of clustering cardiovascular disease risk factors in high-risk abdominally obese patients through its effects not only on energy balance but also on adipose tissue metabolism. For instance, the presence of CB1 receptors in adipose tissue and the recently reported effect of rimonabant on adiponectin production by adipose cells may represent a key factor responsible for the weight loss-independent effect of this CB1 blocker on cardiometabolic risk variables.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence highlights the important role of the brain in the control of glucose homeostasis. Hypothalamic centers sense the availability of peripheral nutrients via redundant and overlapping nutrient-induced peripheral signals such as leptin and insulin and via direct metabolic signaling. Responding to nutrient availability, these hypothalamic regions in turn exert a negative feedback not only on food intake but also on endogenous glucose production. Disruptions in the mechanisms of central nervous system nutrient sensing alter these homeostatic responses and contribute to the pathophysiology of obesity and type 2 diabetes. In this review, we discuss the neural and molecular pathways so far identified as possible targets for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+), an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I, has been widely used as a neurotoxin because it elicits a severe Parkinson's disease-like syndrome characterized by elevation of intracellular reactive oxygen species level and apoptotic death. Adiponectin, secreted from adipose tissue, mediates systemic insulin sensitivity with liver and muscle as target organs. Adiponectin can also suppress superoxide generation in endothelial cells. In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of adiponectin on MPP+-induced cytotoxicity in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, as well as the underlying mechanism. Our results suggest that the protective effects of adiponectin on MPP+-induced apoptosis may be ascribed to its anti-oxidative properties, anti-apoptotic activity via inducing expression of SOD and catalase, and regulation of Bcl-2 and Bax expression. These data indicated that adiponectin might provide a useful therapeutic strategy for the treatment of progressive neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease.",

    "title": "Angiogenesis--a new target for future therapy.",
    "abstract": "Development of blood vessels from in situ differentiating endothelial cells (EC) is called vasculogenesis, whereas sprouting of new blood vessels from the pre-existing ones is termed angiogenesis or neovascularisation. Angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels, is essential during tissue repair, foetal development, and female reproductive cycle. In contrast, uncontrolled angiogenesis promotes tumor and retinopathies, while inadequate angiogenesis can lead to coronary artery disease. A balance between pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic growth factors and cytokines tightly controls angiogenesis. With the identification of several proangiogenic molecules such as the vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF), the fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), and the angiopoietins, and the recent description of specific inhibitors of angiogenesis such as platelet factor-4, angiostatin, endostatin, and vasostatin, it is recognized that therapeutic interference with vasculature formation offers a tool for clinical applications in various pathologies. Inhibition of angiogenesis can prevent diseases such as cancer, diabetic nephropathy, arthritis, psoriasis, whereas stimulation of angiogenesis is beneficial in the treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD), cardiac failure, tissue injury, etc. One of the most specific and critical regulators of angiogenesis is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which regulates endothelial proliferation, permeability, and survival. Substantial evidence also implicates VEGF as an angiogenic mediator in tumors and intraocular neovascular syndromes, and numerous clinical trials are presently testing the hypothesis that inhibition of VEGF may have therapeutic value.",

    "abstract": "The function of leptin, initially confined to its role in energy homeostasis and obesity, has now expanded to the regulation of reproduction, glucose homeostasis, bone formation, wound healing and the immune system. Both stimulation and inhibition of the molecular target of leptin, the leptin receptor (LR), might find applications in disease treatment. Recent advances in the understanding of LR activation mechanisms have led to the design of LR antagonists. Several assays have been developed for the screening and evaluation of LR ligands. Both the extracellular and the intracellular domains of the LR are potential drug targets. The bioluminescence resonance energy transfer technique can be used to screen for compounds that target the extracellular part of the LR, and we propose that the novel reverse mammalian protein-protein interaction trap technique can be used to screen compounds that affect intracellular aspects of LR signalling. These assays can be easily adapted to other pharmacologically relevant receptors.",

Similarities between the structure and anatomical distribution of apelin and its receptor and that of angiotensin II and the angiotensin AT1 receptor provide clues about the physiological functions of this novel signal-transduction system. Now, roles have been established for the apelin system in lowering blood pressure, as a potent cardiac inotrope, in modulating pituitary hormone release and food and water intake, in stress activation, and as a novel adipokine that is excreted from fat cells and regulates insulin. Given its broad array of physiological roles, apelin has attracted much interest as a target for novel therapeutic research and drug design.",

    "abstract": "AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an enzyme that works as a fuel gauge, being activated in situations of high-energy phosphate depletion. Upon activation, AMPK functions to restore cellular ATP by modifying diverse metabolic pathways. AMPK is activated robustly by skeletal muscle contraction and myocardial ischemia, and may be involved in the stimulation of glucose transport and fatty acid oxidation produced by these stimuli. In liver, activation of AMPK results in enhanced fatty acid oxidation and in decreased production of glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Recent studies have shown that AMPK is the cellular mediator for many of the metabolic effects of drugs such as metformin and thiazolidinediones, as well as the insulin sensitizing adipocytokines leptin and adiponectin. These data, along with evidence from studies showing that chemical activation of AMPK in vivo with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) improves blood glucose concentrations and lipid profiles, make this enzyme an attractive pharmacological target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and other metabolic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is exceptionally prevalent in patients with diabetes mellitus and is the most common cause of death. With the emerging pandemic of obesity and resulting metabolic abnormalities, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease is almost nearly certain to increase at a remarkable rate in the near future. Currently, several ligands for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) family of nuclear receptors are prescribed as lipid-lowering and insulin-sensitizing drugs. The PPARs are ligand-activated transcription factors that influence the expression of the entire program of fatty acid utilization enzymes. It is believed that these compounds remedy glucose homeostasis and cardiovascular disease by lowering circulating lipid levels, improving the profile of secreted adipokines, as well as via their anti-inflammatory properties. Conversely, overexpression of the PPARalpha isoform in the muscle or heart of mice drives diminished glucose transporter gene expression and glucose uptake into those insulin target tissues. Although the effects of overexpressing PPARalpha in a specific tissue obviously differ from activating PPARalpha in a systemic manner, studies such as this may influence the development of the next generation of PPAR ligands.",

    "abstract": "Leptin is a secreted adipocyte hormone that plays a key role in the regulation of body weight homeostasis. The leptin effect on human white adipose tissue (WAT) is still debated. The aim of this study was to assess whether the administration of polyethylene glycol-leptin (PEG-OB) in a single supraphysiological dose has transcriptional effects on genes of WAT and to identify its target genes and functional pathways in WAT. Blood samples and WAT biopsies were obtained from 10 healthy nonobese men before treatment and 72 h after the PEG-OB injection, leading to an approximate 809-fold increase in circulating leptin. The WAT gene expression profile before and after the PEG-OB injection was compared using pangenomic microarrays. Functional gene annotations based on the gene ontology of the PEG-OB regulated genes were performed using both an 'in house' automated procedure and GenMAPP (Gene Microarray Pathway Profiler), designed for viewing and analyzing gene expression data in the context of biological pathways. Statistical analysis of microarray data revealed that PEG-OB had a major down-regulated effect on WAT gene expression, as we obtained 1,822 and 100 down- and up-regulated genes, respectively. Microarray data were validated using reverse transcription quantitative PCR. Functional gene annotations of PEG-OB regulated genes revealed that the functional class related to immunity and inflammation was among the most mobilized PEG-OB pathway in WAT. These genes are mainly expressed in the cell of the stroma vascular fraction in comparison with adipocytes. Our observations support the hypothesis that leptin could act on WAT, particularly on genes related to inflammation and immunity, which may suggest a novel leptin target pathway in human WAT.",

    "abstract": "Most obese subjects exhibit leptin resistance, thus restricting the value of direct leptin administration for treatment of obesity. Understanding the leptin signalling mechanism has become crucial for design of novel therapeutic strategies for leptin-resistant/obese patients. The SH2-containing cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 has recently been shown to play a critical role in leptin signalling and functions in hypothalamic control of energy balance and metabolism. Shp2 appears to downregulate the LepRb-STAT3 pathway while promoting extracellular-regulated kinase activation by leptin. Overall, Shp2 is a leptin signal enhancer, as evidenced by the obese and hyperleptinemic phenotype of mutant mice with Shp2 deleted in postmitotic forebrain neurons. Pharmaceutical enhancement of Shp2 activity may be a new approach worthy of consideration in clinical treatment of leptin resistance and obesity. This article discusses the significance of recent experimental data on Shp2 and also the prospects for using Shp2 as a therapeutic target for obese patients.",

    "abstract": "The key feature of metabolic syndrome, a cluster of metabolic and cardiovascular disorders, is systemic insulin resistance, which is associated with dysregulated endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS). Stress signaling induced by inflammation can inhibit insulin signaling. However, molecular mechanisms for the cross-talk between stress signaling and insulin resistance are only partially understood. Resistin, an adipokine/cytokine, is involved in inflammatory processes that could lead to insulin resistance status and vascular diseases. In the current study, we observed that resistin inhibited insulin signaling and eNOS activation in endothelial cells. Up-regulation of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten) expression by resistin may mediate the inhibitory effects. Activated stress signaling p38 MAPK, but not JNK, is involved in PTEN up-regulation. We further found that p38 target transcriptional factor activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2) bound to ATF sites in the PTEN promoter. The phosphorylation/activation of ATF-2 and its binding to PTEN promoter were increased by resistin treatment. In summary, up-regulation of PTEN is involved in the inhibitory effects of resistin on insulin signaling and eNOS activation in endothelial cells. Resistin induces PTEN expression by activating stress signaling p38 pathway, which may activate target transcription factor ATF-2, which in turn induces PTEN expression. Our findings suggest that resistin-mediated inhibition of insulin signaling and eNOS activation may contribute to cardiovascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "Muraglitazar, a novel dual (alpha/gamma) peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) activator, was investigated for its antidiabetic properties and its effects on metabolic abnormalities in genetically obese diabetic db/db mice. In db/db mice and normal mice, muraglitazar treatment modulates the expression of PPAR target genes in white adipose tissue and liver. In young hyperglycemic db/db mice, muraglitazar treatment (0.03-50 mg . kg(-1) . day(-1) for 2 weeks) results in dose-dependent reductions of glucose, insulin, triglycerides, free fatty acids, and cholesterol. In older hyperglycemic db/db mice, longer-term muraglitazar treatment (30 mg . kg(-1) . day(-1) for 4 weeks) prevents time-dependent deterioration of glycemic control and development of insulin deficiency. In severely hyperglycemic db/db mice, muraglitazar treatment (10 mg . kg(-1) . day(-1) for 2 weeks) improves oral glucose tolerance and reduces plasma glucose and insulin levels. In addition, treatment increases insulin content in the pancreas. Finally, muraglitazar treatment increases abnormally low plasma adiponectin levels, increases high-molecular weight adiponectin complex levels, reduces elevated plasma corticosterone levels, and lowers elevated liver lipid content in db/db mice. The overall conclusions are that in db/db mice, the novel dual (alpha/gamma) PPAR activator muraglitazar 1) exerts potent and efficacious antidiabetic effects, 2) preserves pancreatic insulin content, and 3) improves metabolic abnormalities such as hyperlipidemia, fatty liver, low adiponectin levels, and elevated corticosterone levels.",

    "abstract": "We have identified Kruppel-like factor 7 (KLF7) as a new candidate for conferring susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. To ascertain the possible involvement of KLF7 in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, we examined the functional roles of KLF7 in various types of cells. In human adipocytes overexpressing KLF7, the expression of adiponectin and leptin was decreased compared with that in control cells, whereas expression of IL-6 was increased. In the insulin-secreting cell line (HIT-T15 cells), the expression and glucose-induced secretion of insulin were significantly suppressed in KLF7-overexpressed cells compared with control cells, accompanied by the reduction in the expression of glucose transporter 2, sulfonylurea receptor 1, Kir6.2, and pancreatic-duodenal homeobox factor 1. We also found that the overexpression of KLF7 resulted in the decrease of hexokinase 2 expression in smooth muscle cells, and of glucose transporter 2 expression in the HepG2 cells. These results suggest that KLF7 may contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes through an impairment of insulin biosynthesis and secretion in pancreatic beta-cells and a reduction of insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues. Therefore, we suggest that KLF7 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, and may be a useful target for new drugs to aid in the prevention and treatment of this disease.",

    "abstract": "We identified that leptin resistance in aged-obese rats has both peripheral and central components. The central resistance is characterized by diminished hypothalamic leptin receptors and impaired leptin signal transduction. We developed a new model of leptin-induced leptin resistance in which application of the central leptin gene delivery produces unabated hypothalamic leptin over-expression. The chronic central elevation of leptin precipitates leptin resistance in young animals devoid of obesity and exacerbates it in mature or aged animals with obesity. Despite leptin resistance, our aged obese, DIO, and leptin-induced leptin resistant rats were fully responsive to central pharmacological melanocortin activation. We propose that the central leptin resistance resides between leptin receptor and melanocortin receptor activation. Our central POMC gene therapy overcame leptin resistance, producing weight and fat loss and improved insulin sensitivity in obese Zucker and aged rats. This success highlights the central melanocortin system as a useful drug target for combating obesity.",

    "abstract": "The effect of leptin on liver alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) was determined in male rats. Administration of one or three daily doses of leptin (1microg/g of body weight intraperitoneally) increased ADH activity. Leptin enhanced ADH synthesis without an effect on ADH degradation. Leptin did not change ADH mRNA, indicating that the effect of leptin in enhancing ADH occurs at the post-transcriptional level. Leptin increased eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2alpha, eIF2B activity, and the eIF4E-eIF4G complex, while it decreased the inhibitory complex of eIF4E with the eIF4E-binding protein-1 (4E-BP1). Leptin increased mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor) that phosphorylates 4E-BP1. In conclusion, leptin increases liver ADH activity and ADH protein due to an increase in synthesis which occurs at the post-transcriptional level. The effect of leptin in enhancing translational initiating factors may be of significance in the regulation not only of ADH but also of many other proteins.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin plays important roles in regulating insulin sensitivity and atherogenesis. Adiponectin has been shown to suppress hepatic glucose production in rodents. It has not been reported whether ectopically expressed adiponectin could regulate glucose metabolism in cultured hepatocyte-like cells. In the current study, the effect of adiponectin on glucose production was analyzed by ectopically expressing the protein in hepatoma H4IIE cells using an adenovirus delivery system to generate both human full-length and the globular domain of the protein. Expression of adiponectin in hepatoma H4IIE cells, in the absence of insulin, suppressed expression of the genes encoding glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, rate-limiting enzymes in the gluconeogenic pathway. Furthermore, expression of adiponectin in H4IIE cells suppressed glucose production from lactate and pyruvate. Purified recombinant human adiponectin also reduced glucose production in H4IIE cells and in rat primary hepatocytes in the absence of insulin. These data suggest that adiponectin protein could exert its function independent of the presence of insulin in these culture systems.",

    "abstract": "NASH is expected to be a major target disease in near future, although we are too short in information to realize NASH. In this study, we revealed the prevalence of fatty liver, which is a background disease of NASH, in Kyoto. Then we made histological diagnosis of NASH from chronic liver disorder with fatty liver. By using the data obtained from medical check-up with more than 1000 subjects per year in Kyoto, the prevalence of fatty liver on ultrasound, serum ALT, body mass index (BMI) were compared between 1994 and 2004. Next 32 patients with elevated ALT and bright liver on ultrasound were biopsied in order to diagnose them as NASH or not. Biochemical, serological and hormonal parameters as well as adipocytokine profiles were also studied. Lastly, liver tissues from those patients were examined to compare the expression of peroxisome proliferator activator receptor (PPAR) alpha and gamma. It was revealed that the prevalence of fatty liver increased from 12.9 to 34.7% over 10 years. The mean ALT and BMI also increased in this period. From 32 patients, 6 cases were excluded for alcohol, autoimmune hepatitis, and drug-induced liver injury, leaving 26 cases to enter the study. Among them, 12 and 8 patients showed grade 1 and grade 2 steatohepatitis, which were consistant with NASH. Various data were compared among simple steatosis, grade 1 steatohepatitis, and grade 2 steatohepatitis, but highly sensitive CRP was the sole parameter with statistical significance. PPAR alpha seems to be expressed higher in patients with steatohepatitis, although PPAR alpha did not show any significance. We found the prevalence of fatty liver was increasing over 10 years. The histological examination showed more patients with grade 1 or grade 2 steatohepatitis than expected, which means we might have much more NASH cases undiagnosed. We were unable to propose reliable diagnostic markers to diagnose NASH from this study.",

    "title": "Inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption by ezetimibe is a novel therapeutic target for fatty liver.",
    "abstract": "Ezetimibe is a novel lipid-lowering agent that inhibits intestinal absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol. The effects of ezetimibe on low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol were found to generally consistent across all subgroups analyzed, including baseline lipid profile, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and body mass index. Furthermore, recent clinical studies also revealed that co-administration of ezetimibe with on-going statins offered a well-tolerated and efficacious treatment to lower LDL-cholesterol levels in hypercholesterolemic patients with diabetes mellitus or the metabolic syndrome. Niemann-Pick C1 like 1 (NPC1L1) protein is recently found to be critical for intestinal cholesterol absorption, and is a target protein for ezetimibe. Human NPC1L1 protein is predominantly expressed in liver, whereas small intestine expression is only about 2-4% of that found in the liver. Thus, NPC1L1 does not function solely in the intestinal cholesterol absorption. Furthermore, loss of NPC1L1 expression has been shown to protect against diet-induced fatty liver. These observations let us to speculate that ezetimibe will become a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver, the hepatic manifestation of insulin resistant patients with the metabolic syndrome. In this paper, we would like to propose the possible ways of testing our hypothesis as follows. (1) Does ezetimibe treatment improve fatty liver in patients with hypercholesterolemia or the metabolic syndrome? If the answers are yes, are these beneficial effects of ezetimibe superior to those of other anti-hyperlipidemic resins with equihypolipidemic properties? (2) Does ezetimibe treatment improve insulin sensitivity in fatty liver patients with the metabolic syndrome? (3) How about the effects of ezetimibe treatment on serum levels of adiponectin, a key adipokine with insulin-sensitizing property? Large clinical trials will provide us with more definite information whether ezetimibe treatment can improve fatty liver and resultantly reduce the risk of progression of liver diseases in patients with the metabolic syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Obesity and osteoporosis have grave consequences for human health, quality of life, and even the efficiency of the labor force and economy. However, these pathologies share a common cell progenitor, revealing a surprising target for drug research and development. Recent findings show that high adipocyte count in bone marrow is directly related to bone loss, as fat cells replace osteoblasts (or bone-forming cells). The objective of this review is to examine the importance of adipocyte apoptosis in the treatment of obesity and/or osteoporosis, with special emphasis on natural products as promising leads for drug development. We have induced in vivo adipocyte apoptosis, using leptin, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), beta adrenergic agonists and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) in rodents. The results of leptin treatments on rats are suppressed food intake, reduced body weight, reduced body fat, adipocyte apoptosis, and elevated energy expenditure. Further, leptin treatment of leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice increases endosteal bone formation and bone mineral density. Adipocyte apoptosis has also been induced in vitro using tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) from Camellia sinensis and ajoene, from Allium sativum. Natural products have potential for inducing apoptosis of adipose tissue, inhibiting bone marrow adipogenesis and increasing the expression of osteogenic factors in bone, thereby yielding effective treatments for obesity and osteoporosis.",

    "abstract": "Leptin, a pleiotropic cytokine that regulates food intake and metabolic and endocrine responses, has emerged recently as an important regulator of mucosal inflammatory responses to bacterial infection. In this study, we report that in sublingual salivary gland acinar cells leptin plays a role in the suppression of up-regulation in endothelin-1 (ET-1), induced by the LPS of a periodontopathic bacterium P. gingivalis. We show that P. gingivalisLPS detrimental effect on salivary mucin synthesis, associated with up-regulation (3.9-fold) in ET-1 generation and the enhancement (3.2-fold) in endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1) activity, was subject to a dose-dependent suppression by leptin. The impedance by leptin of the LPS inhibitory effect on mucin synthesis was blocked by wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K, as well as by ERK inhibitor, PD98059. However, while the blockade of ERK led also to amplification in the impedance by leptin of the LPS-induced expression of ECE-1 and ET-1, the effect was not observed in the presence of wortmannin. The findings are the first to demonstrate that leptin counters the pathological consequences of P. gingivalisinfection on the synthesis of salivary mucin through the involvement in signaling events of PI3K and ERK pathways. We also show that the ERK cascade represents a critical signaling target for leptin in the LPS-induced up-regulation in ET-1.",

    "abstract": "Aging is associated with a significant reduction of lipogenic enzyme gene expression and lipogenesis in white adipose tissue (WAT). The age-related increase of lep gene expression could be, in part, responsible for these changes. Considering that sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) plays an important role in regulation of lipogenic enzyme gene expression, it is likely that the age-related decrease of WAT lipogenic potential could be a consequence of the inhibition of SREBP-1c gene expression by leptin. We determined whether the increase of lep gene expression would account for the age-related decrease in SREBP-1c and its direct target, main lipogenic enzymes acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS), by assaying the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of SREBP-1c, FAS, ACC, and leptin in WAT of 2-month-old (young) and 20-month-old (old) rats. Leptin mRNA level was much higher in the old animals, whereas in contrast, old rats displayed much lower mRNA levels of SREBP-1c and lipogenic enzymes. Moreover, experimentally increased plasma leptin concentration in young rats to the value observed in old rats resulted in the decrease of SREBP-1c, FAS, and ACC mRNA levels in WAT. Thus, the increase of lep gene expression could, in part, account for the reduced SREBP-1c gene expression and, consequently, the diminished lipogenic activity in WAT of old animals.",

    "abstract": "Neonatal administration of monosodium glutamate (MSG) to rats produces severe lesions in certain hypothalamic nuclei, with repercussions in different neuroendocrine axes, and serves as a model for their study. In addition, adipose tissue, as a target organ, is known to be directly related to several neurondocrine axes. We used 21-day-old female Sprague-Dawley rats that had received a neonatal treatment with MSG (4 mg/g body weight, i.p., from day 2 up to day 10 of age) in addition to control rats (injected with 10% NaCl solution, on a similar schedule). We performed a specific immunohistochemical study on each anterior-pituitary cell population, along with the morphometry of these cells and of the parietal and visceral adipose tissue, and measured the levels of serum leptin and triglycerides. The MSG animals evinced significant changes in volume density (VD), cell density (CD), and cell size (CS) in the corticotropes, thyrotropes, and LH gonadotropes, but not in the somatotropes, lactotropes, and FSH gonadotropes. The modification common to the three cell types was a hyperplasia, but with different results depending on cell size. Furthermore, in the MSG rats significant changes were also observed in the VD, CD, and CS of the adipose tissue, consisting of adipogenesis and decrease of adipocyte size in visceral fat, together with probable lipogenesis as judged by an increase in adipocyte size in the parietal fat. The serum levels of leptin and triglycerides appeared significantly higher in MSG animals. For the first time in this animal model, and at the level of three neuroendocrine axes, our results suggest changes that correlate hypothalamic damage, cellular pituitary alterations, and the response of the adipose tissue as a target organ for MSG insult.",

    "abstract": "Both protein kinase C (PKC) activation and increased oxidative stress have been paid attention to as important causative factors for diabetic vascular complications. In this article, we show a PKC-dependent increase in oxidative stress in vascular tissues of diabetes and insulin resistant state. High glucose level and free fatty acids stimulate de novo diacylglycerol (DAG)-PKC pathway and subsequently stimulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production through a PKC-dependent activation of NAD(P)H oxidase. Increasing evidence has also shown that NAD(P)H oxidase components are upregulated in micro- and macro- vascular tissues of animal models and patients of diabetes and obesity. It is also noted that increased intrinsic angiotensin II production may amplify such a PKC-dependent activation of NAD(P)H oxidase in diabetic vascular tissues. These mechanisms may play an important role in the diabetic vascular complications and the accelerated atherosclerosis associated with diabetes and obesity. In addition, recent reports have shown that NAD(P)H oxidases exist in pancreatic beta-cells and adipocytes, and this oxidase-generated ROS production may play an important role in both the progressive beta-cell dysfunction and the dysregulated adipocytokine production and subsequent obesity-induced metabolic syndrome. These results suggest that an NAD(P)H oxidase activation may be a useful therapeutic target for preventing diabetic vascular complications, progressive beta-cell dysfunction and metabolic syndrome.",

    "title": "Regulation of adiponectin receptor 1 in human hepatocytes by agonists of nuclear receptors.",
    "abstract": "The adiponectin receptors AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 have been identified to mediate the insulin-sensitizing effects of adiponectin. Although AdipoR2 was suggested to be the main receptor for this adipokine in hepatocytes, AdipoR1 protein is highly abundant in primary human hepatocytes and hepatocytic cell lines. Nuclear receptors are main regulators of lipid metabolism and activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha and gamma, retinoid X receptor (RXR), and liver X receptor (LXR) by specific ligands may influence AdipoR1 abundance. AdipoR1 protein is neither altered by RXR or LXR agonists nor by pioglitazone. In contrast, fenofibric acid reduces AdipoR1 whereas hepatotoxic troglitazone upregulates AdipoR1 protein in HepG2 cells. Taken together this work shows for the first time that AdipoR1 protein is expressed in human hepatocytes but that it is not a direct target gene of nuclear receptors. Elevated AdipoR1 induced by hepatotoxic troglitazone may indicate a role of this receptor in adiponectin-mediated beneficial effects in liver damage.",

    "title": "Different response of senescent female Sprague-Dawley rats to gemfibrozil and rosiglitazone administration.",
    "abstract": "Eighteen-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats present age-related alterations in lipid and glucose metabolism and are resistant to the effect of PPARalpha-activating hypolipidemic drugs, such as gemfibrozil. We tested if these animals were responsive to the administration of rosiglitazone, an insulin-sensitizer acting on PPARgamma. We determined in 18-month-old female Sprague-Dawley rats treated for 21 days with a daily dose of 3mg gemfibrozil/kg or 3mg rosiglitazone/kg: (i) plasma concentrations of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), glucose, insulin and leptin, (ii) hepatic concentrations of TG, NEFA and cholesteryl esters (CE), and (iii) the liver expression and binding activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), and several of its target genes, hepatic nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4), and liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha). Although gemfibrozil induced mild effects on hepatic PPARalpha, HNF-4, and LXRalpha, only rosiglitazone significantly reduced plasma TG (59%), glucose (19%), insulin (61%), and leptin (66%), and liver TG (43%), CE (49%), and NEFA (27%). These changes were associated to an increased body weight gain and a decrease in visceral fat (8.7-fold and 37% vs. control females, respectively). The beneficial effect of rosiglitazone treatment in 18-month-old female rats could be related to a direct effect on white adipose tissue.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic proteins have revolutionized the treatment of many diseases but low activity or rapid clearance limits their utility. New approaches have been taken to design drugs with enhanced in vivo activity and half-life to reduce injection frequency, increase convenience, and improve patient compliance. One recently used approach is glycoengineering, changing protein-associated carbohydrate to alter pharmacokinetic properties of proteins. This technology has been applied to erythropoietin and resulted in the discovery of darbepoetin alfa (DA), a hyperglycosylated analogue of erythropoietin that contains two additional N-linked carbohydrates, a threefold increase in serum half-life and increased in vivo activity compared to recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO). The increased serum half-life allows for less frequent dosing to maintain target hemoglobin levels in anemic patients. Carbohydrates on DA and other molecules can also increase molecular stability, solubility, increase in vivo biological activity, and reduce immunogenicity. These properties are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), and hypothalamic neuronal histamine suppress food intake, a target of leptin action in the brain. This study examined the interactions of GLP-1, CRH, and histamine downstream from the leptin-signaling pathway in regulating feeding behavior. Infusion of GLP-1 into the third cerebral ventricle (i3vt) at a dose of 1 mug significantly decreased the initial 1 h cumulative food intake in rats as compared with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) controls. The GLP-1-induced suppression of feeding was partially attenuated by intraperitoneal pretreatment with alpha-fluoromethylhistidine (FMH), a specific suicide inhibitor of histidine decarboxylase, which depletes hypothalamic neuronal histamine. Pretreatment with alpha-helical CRH (10 microg/rat, i3vt), a nonselective CRH antagonist, abolished the GLP-1-induced suppression of feeding completely. I3vt infusion of GLP-1 increased the CRH content and histamine turnover assessed using the pargyline-induced accumulation of tele-methyl histamine (t-MH), a major metabolite of neuronal histamine, in the hypothalamus. The central infusion of CRH also induced the increase of histamine turnover and CRH receptor type 1 was localized on the cell body of histamine neuron. Pretreatment with exendin(9-39), a GLP-1 receptor antagonist, attenuated the leptin-induced increase in CRH content of the hypothalamus. Finally, i3vt infusion of leptin also increased histamine turnover in the hypothalamus. Pretreatment with exendin(9-39), alpha-helical CRH or both antagonists attenuated the leptin-induced responses of t-MH levels in the hypothalamus. These results suggest that CRH or hypothalamic neuronal histamine mediates the GLP-1-induced suppression of feeding behavior, that CRH mediates GLP-1 signaling to neuronal histamine and that a functional link from GLP-1 to neuronal histamine via CRH constitutes the leptin-signaling pathway regulating feeding behavior.",

    "title": "PPARalpha activators may be good candidates as antiaging agents.",
    "abstract": "Aging is associated with a metabolic decline characterized by the development of changes in fat distribution, obesity, and insulin resistance. Dysfunctional humoral and cell-mediated immune responses occur with age, and these aberrations have been implicated in the increased incidence of infectious diseases, hyporesponsiveness to vaccination, and the etiology of numerous chronic degenerative diseases. All these metabolic and immune alterations are associated with a variety of age-related diseases that subsequently result in increased mortality. Leptin can modulate many of the metabolic alterations characteristic of aging. Leptin resistance has been implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity-related complications involving abnormalities of lipid metabolism that resemble those of old age. Increased plasma leptin levels with aging suggest resistance to leptin action and may explain why elderly subjects have abdominal obesity and insulin resistance. Leptin's failure may be considered for the metabolic decline seen with aging. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha, the transcription factor for the mitochondrial and peroxisomal enzymes of beta-oxidation, and its target enzymes, are upregulated by hyperleptinemia. PPARalpha has been shown to mediate the action of the hypolipidemic drugs of the fibrate class on lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. PPARalpha activators furthermore improve glucose homeostasis and influence body weight and energy homeostasis. The administration of agents capable of activating the PPARalpha was found to restore the cellular redox balance, evidenced by a lowering of tissue lipid peroxidation, an elimination of constitutively active NF-kappaB, loss in spontaneous inflammatory cytokine production, and ailing in the aging immunity.",

    "title": "Hypothalamic resistin immunoreactivity is reduced by obesity in the mouse: co-localization with alpha-melanostimulating hormone.",
    "abstract": "Resistin is a new adipokine expressed in mouse, rat and human adipose tissue. Resistin may be an important link between obesity and insulin resistance, though this controversial view is complicated by the discovery of multiple sites of resistin expression, including human macrophages, placenta and pancreas. In previous studies we demonstrated that the mouse hypothalamo-pituitary system was also a site of resistin production. Pituitary resistin is developmentally regulated, reduced in the ob/ob mouse and severely down-regulated by food deprivation (24 h). An unexpected finding was that hypothalamic resistin mRNA remained unaffected by fasting. The present experiments examined the localization and possible regulation of hypothalamic resistin protein. Using immunohistochemistry we observed a complex network of resistin+ fibres extending rostrally from the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) to the preoptic area. Labelled cell bodies occurred only in the ARC and in a periventricular region of the dorsal hypothalamus. Hypothalamic resistin immunoreactivity (ir) was unaffected by fasting (48 h) or by a high fat diet, but the periventricular staining was greatly increased in the lactating mouse. Marked reductions in resistin+ fibres were seen in brain tissue from: (a) ob/ob mice, (b) young mice made underweight for their age by raising them in large litters (20 pups per litter) and (c) mice with hypothalamic lesions induced by monosodium glutamate (MSG) or gold thioglucose (GTG). We speculate that the resistin-ir deficit in genetically obese mice, and in severely underweight mice, could be due to low or absent leptin. In contrast, though MSG- and GTG-treated mice have high levels of circulating leptin, in the presence of excessive visceral fat deposits, we hypothesize that damage to the ARC destroys the resistin+ cell bodies. This latter supposition led us to an additional hypothesis, that resistin-ir would be contained in neurons expressing the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene. This proved to be correct. Double label immunofluorescence histochemistry revealed that alpha-MSH-ir, a marker for POMC neurons, was co-localized with resistin-ir. In conclusion, our data reveal a second example of an adipocytokine co-localized with a hypothalamic neuropeptide. We reported previously that leptin was co-localized with oxytocin and vasopressin. RT-PCR analysis confirmed that resistin mRNA is readily detectable in ARC, but further work is required to determine whether the resistin gene is expressed in POMC neurons or if resistin is specifically accumulated by these cells. Nonetheless, our data suggest that the hypothalamus is a target tissue for resistin.",

    "title": "Leptin-induced nitric oxide production in white adipocytes is mediated through PKA and MAP kinase activation.",
    "abstract": "Leptin injection increases plasma levels of nitrites and/or nitrates, an index of nitric oxide (NO) production. Because plasma levels of NO are correlated with fat mass and because adipose tissue is the main source of leptin, it seems that adipose tissue plays a major role in NO release induced by leptin. Adipocytes express both leptin receptors and nitric oxide synthase (NOS; including the endothelial isoform, NOS III, and the inducible isoform, NOS II). In this study, we have demonstrated that physiological concentrations of leptin stimulate NOS activity in adipocytes. This effect of leptin is abolished by 1) AG490, an inhibitor of Janus tyrosine kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; 2) U0126, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p42/p44 MAPK); and 3) N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (H-89) or Rp diastereomer of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic phosphorothioate, two inhibitors of protein kinase A, but not by wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Immunoblotting studies have shown that leptin fails to activate Akt but increases p42/p44 MAPK phosphorylation, an effect that is prevented by U0126 but not by H-89. Furthermore, leptin induces NOS III phosphorylation at Ser(1179) and Thr(497), but not when adipocytes are pretreated with H-89 or U0126. Finally, stimulation of adipocyte NOS activity by leptin is either unaltered when protein phosphatase 2A is inhibited by 1 nM okadaic acid or completely abolished when protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) activity is inhibited by 3 nM tautomycin, which supports a crucial role for PP1 in mediating this effect of leptin. On the whole, these experiments demonstrate that NOS activity is a novel target for leptin in adipocytes and that the leptin-induced NOS activity is at least in part the result of NOS III phosphorylations via both protein kinase A and p42/p44 MAPK activation. More generally, this study also leads to the hypothesis of NO as a potentially important factor for leptin signaling in adipocytes.",

    "abstract": "Despite significant reductions in the consumption of dietary fat, the prevalence of obesity is steadily rising in western civilization. Of particular concern is the recent epidemic of childhood obesity, which is expected to increase the incidence of obesity-related disorders. The obese gene (ob) protein product leptin is a hormone that is secreted from adipocytes and functions to suppress appetite and increase energy expenditure. Leptin is an attractive candidate for the treatment of obesity as it is an endogenous protein and has been demonstrated to have potent effects on bodyweight and adiposity in rodents. Whereas leptin has been successfully used in the treatment of leptin-deficient obese patients, trials in hyperleptinemic obese patients have yielded variable results. Long-acting leptins have been tried but with no greater success. Other strategies including the use of leptin analogs and other factors that bypass normal leptin delivery systems are being developed. Identifying the mechanisms at the molecular level by which leptin functions will create new avenues for pharmaceutical targeting to simulate the intracellular effects of leptin.",

    "title": "Nuclear receptors as targets for drug development: molecular mechanisms for regulation of obesity and insulin resistance by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, CREB-binding protein, and adiponectin.",
    "abstract": "Obesity is defined as increased mass of adipose tissue, conferring a higher risk of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders such as diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and coronary heart disease. To investigate the role of transcriptional factors, which are involved in adipocytes differentiation and adiposity, we have generated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma or CREB-binding protein (CBP)-deficient mice by gene targeting. Heterozygous PPARgamma-deficient mice were protected from the development of insulin resistance due to adipocyte hypertrophy under a high-fat diet. Heterozygous CBP-deficient mice showed increased insulin sensitivity and were completely protected from body weight gain induced by a high-fat diet. PPARgamma or CBP deficiency results in increased effects of hormones such as adiponectin and leptin. Adiponectin was decreased in obesity and lipoatrophy, and replenishment of adiponectin ameliorated insulin resistance. Moreover, adiponectin-deficient mice showed insulin resistance and atherogenic phenotype. Finally, cDNA encoding adiponectin receptors (AdipoR1/R2) have been identified by expression cloning. The expression of AdipoR1/R2 appears to be inversely regulated by insulin in physiological and pathophysiological states such as fasting/refeeding, insulin deficiency, and hyperinsulinemia models, and it is correlated with adiponectin sensitivity. These results facilitate the understanding of molecular mechanisms of adiponectin actions and obesity-linked diseases such as diabetes and atherosclerosis and propose the molecular targets for anti-diabetic and anti-atherogenic drugs.",

    "abstract": "Leptin is most studied for its primary role in the CNS control of energy balance and food intake in humans and rodents, yet it has functions on multiple target sites including the adrenal gland. In adult rodents, leptin has been shown to inhibit adrenal steroidogenesis and we have recently demonstrated that some of the mechanisms responsible for leptin-induced inhibition of adrenal glucocorticoid production, namely a reduction of StAR protein expression are already present in the neonatal adrenal gland. The effect of leptin on the neonatal adrenal gland integrates well with the previously demonstrated effect of this protein to inhibit stress responses, enhance glucocorticoid receptor expression in the CNS and sensitivity to glucocorticoid inhibitory feedback in neonates. The leptin receptor isoform and intracellular mechanisms involved in regulation of the adrenocortical activity at multiple levels might differ between target tissues (CNS vs periphery) and age (neonates vs adult). Neonatal leptin represents an important regulator of adrenocortical function during a critical period of brain development, which is exquisitely sensitive to circulating glucocortcoid concentrations. Since circulating leptin levels in neonates vary according to maternal diet, this protein can be viewed as a critical link between environmental and maternal factors and the developing physiology of the infant.",

    "title": "Metabolic syndrome: a clinical and molecular perspective.",
    "abstract": "The metabolic syndrome is a cluster of interrelated common clinical disorders, including obesity, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia (hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL cholesterol levels). According to recently defined criteria, the metabolic syndrome is prevalent and is associated with a greater risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease than any of its individual components. Primary defects in energy balance that produce obesity (and visceral adiposity in particular) are sufficient to drive all aspects of the syndrome. Increased free fatty acids and lipid accumulation in certain organs are mediators of insulin resistance. Obesity also leads to a proinflammatory and prothrombotic state that potentiates atherosclerosis. Pathways leading directly from adiposity to the genesis of dyslipidemia and hypertension have been elucidated. Recent knowledge implies a role for fat-derived adipokines, including TNF alpha and adiponectin, as pathogenic contributors or protective factors. Current therapies include diet and exercise as well as agents indicated for the treatment of individual components of the syndrome. Future therapies may accrue from the aggressive pursuit of newer molecular drug targets that have the potential to prevent or treat multiple aspects of the metabolic syndrome.",

    "title": "A role for the central histaminergic system in the leptin-mediated increase in cardiovascular dynamics.",
    "abstract": "The central nervous system (CNS) histaminergic neurons have been shown to regulate feeding behavior and are a target of leptin in the brain. The present study aimed to examine the involvement of the histaminergic system in the leptin-mediated regulation of cardiovascular dynamics. We investigated the cardiovascular responses to the CNS administration of histamine, leptin and alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) both in the presence and absence of the histamine H1 antagonist, chlorpheniramine. The intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of histamine resulted in an immediate increase in both mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) and vasoconstricted the iliac, renal and superior mesenteric vessels. The i.c.v. pretreatment with chlorpheniramine attenuated the histamine-induced increase in MAP, HR and decreased vascular conductance. The i.c.v. administration of leptin increased MAP and HR and decreased vascular conductance. The i.c.v. pretreatment with chlorpheniramine decreased the leptin-induced increase in MAP and the leptin-mediated iliac vasoconstriction. The i.c.v. administration of alpha-MSH also increased MAP, HR and decreased vascular conductance. However, pretreatment with chlorpheniramine did not influence the central alpha-MSH-mediated increase in MAP, HR and decreased vascular conductance. These results indicate that the central histaminergic system mediated by H1 receptors have a role in the central signaling pathway and is involved in leptin's regulation of cardiovascular dynamics. It appears that leptin directly or indirectly stimulates histaminergic neurons that lead to increased cardiovascular activity.",

    "title": "Basomedial hypothalamic injections of neuropeptide Y conjugated to saporin selectively disrupt hypothalamic controls of food intake.",
    "abstract": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) conjugated to saporin (NPY-SAP), a ribosomal inactivating toxin, is a newly developed compound designed to selectively target and lesion NPY receptor-expressing cells. We injected NPY-SAP into the basomedial hypothalamus (BMH), just dorsal to the arcuate nucleus (ARC), to investigate its neurotoxicity and to determine whether ARC NPY neurons are required for glucoprivic feeding. We found that NPY-SAP profoundly reduced NPY Y1 receptor and alpha MSH immunoreactivity, as well as NPY, Agouti gene-related protein (AGRP), and cocaine and amphetamine-related transcript mRNA expression in the BMH. NPY-SAP lesions were localized to the injection site with no evidence of retrograde transport by hindbrain NPY neurons with BMH terminals. These lesions impaired responses to intracerebroventricular (icv) leptin (5 microg/5 microl x d) and ghrelin (2 microg/5 microl), which are thought to alter feeding primarily by actions on ARC NPY/AGRP and proopiomelanocortin/cocaine and amphetamine-related transcript neurons. However, the hypothesis that NPY/AGRP neurons are required downstream mediators of glucoprivic feeding was not supported. Although NPY/AGRP neurons were destroyed by NPY-SAP, the lesion did not impair either the feeding or the hyperglycemic response to 2-deoxy-D-glucose-induced blockade of glycolysis use. Similarly, responses to glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1, 5 microg/3 microl icv), NPY (5 microg/3 microl icv), cholecystokinin octapeptide (4 microg/kg ip), and beta-mercaptoacetate (68 mg/kg ip) were not altered by the NPY-SAP lesion. Thus, NPY-SAP destroyed NPY receptor-expressing neurons in the ARC and selectively disrupted controls of feeding dependent on those neurons but did not disrupt peptidergic or metabolic controls dependent upon circuitry outside the BMH.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a principal causative factor in the development of metabolic syndrome. Here we report that increased oxidative stress in accumulated fat is an important pathogenic mechanism of obesity-associated metabolic syndrome. Fat accumulation correlated with systemic oxidative stress in humans and mice. Production of ROS increased selectively in adipose tissue of obese mice, accompanied by augmented expression of NADPH oxidase and decreased expression of antioxidative enzymes. In cultured adipocytes, elevated levels of fatty acids increased oxidative stress via NADPH oxidase activation, and oxidative stress caused dysregulated production of adipocytokines (fat-derived hormones), including adiponectin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, IL-6, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1. Finally, in obese mice, treatment with NADPH oxidase inhibitor reduced ROS production in adipose tissue, attenuated the dysregulation of adipocytokines, and improved diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hepatic steatosis. Collectively, our results suggest that increased oxidative stress in accumulated fat is an early instigator of metabolic syndrome and that the redox state in adipose tissue is a potentially useful therapeutic target for obesity-associated metabolic syndrome.",

    "title": "Melatonin enhances leptin expression by rat adipocytes in the presence of insulin.",
    "abstract": "Leptin and melatonin play an important role in the regulation of body mass and energy balance. Both hormones show a circadian rhythm, with increasing values at night. In addition, melatonin receptors were recently described in adipocytes, where leptin is synthesized. Here, we investigated the influence of melatonin and its interaction with insulin and dexamethasone on leptin expression. Isolated rat adipocytes were incubated with melatonin (1 nM) alone or in combination with insulin (5 nM) and/or dexamethasone (7 nM) for 6 h. Melatonin or insulin alone did not affect leptin expression, but together they increased it by 120%. Dexamethasone increased leptin mRNA content (105%), and this effect was not enhanced by melatonin. Simultaneous treatment with the three hormones provoked a further increase in leptin release (250%) and leptin mRNA (100%). Melatonin prevented the forskolin-induced inhibition (95%) of leptin expression. In addition, melatonin's ability to stimulate leptin release (in the presence of insulin) was completely blocked by pertussis toxin and luzindole. To gain further insight into the molecular basis of melatonin and insulin synergism, the insulin-signaling pathway was investigated. Melatonin increased the insulin-induced insulin receptor-beta tyrosine phosphorylation, which led to an increased serine phosphorylation of the downstream convergent protein Akt. We concluded that melatonin interacts with insulin and upregulates insulin-stimulated leptin expression. These effects are caused by melatonin binding to the pertussis toxin-sensitive G(i) protein-coupled membrane receptor (MT1 subtype) and the cross talk with insulin, since insulin receptor and its convergent target Akt are coactivated by melatonin.",

    "title": "Metformin inhibits leptin secretion via a mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling pathway in brown adipocytes.",
    "abstract": "Metformin is an anti-diabetic drug with anorexigenic properties. The precise cellular mechanisms of its action are not entirely understood. Adipose tissue has recently been recognized as an important endocrine organ that is pivotal for the regulation of insulin resistance and energy homeostasis. Due to its thermogenic capacity brown adipose tissue contributes to the regulation of energy metabolism and is an attractive target tissue for pharmacological approaches to treating insulin resistance and obesity. Leptin is the prototypic adipocyte-derived hormone inducing a negative energy balance. We investigated effects of metformin on adipocyte metabolism, signalling, and leptin secretion in a brown adipocyte model. Metformin acutely stimulated p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase in a dose- (3.2-fold at 1 mmol/l, P&lt; 0.05) as well as time-dependent (3.8-fold at 5 min, P&lt; 0.05) manner. This stimulation was highly selective since phosphorylation of intermediates in the stress kinase, janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), and phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase signalling pathways such as p38 MAP kinase, STAT3, and Akt was unaltered. Furthermore, chronic metformin treatment for 12 days dose-dependently inhibited leptin secretion by 35% and 75% at 500 mumol/l and 1 mmol/l metformin respectively (P&lt; 0.01). This reduction was not caused by alterations in adipocyte differentiation. Moreover, the impairment in leptin secretion by metformin was reversible within 48 h after removal of the drug. Pharmacological inhibition of p44/p42 MAP kinase prevented the metformin-induced negative effect on leptin secretion. Taken together, our data demonstrate direct acute effects of metformin on adipocyte signalling and endocrine function with robust inhibition of leptin secretion. They suggest a selective molecular mechanism that may contribute to the anorexigenic effect of this antidiabetic compound.",

    "abstract": "The effects of red yeast rice extracts (RE) on adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells were studied. RE were extracted from embryonic rice fermented with red yeast (Monascus ruber). These extracts significantly decreased glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activity and lipid accumulation, a marker of adipogenesis, in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, mRNA expression levels of both CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) alpha and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma, the key adipogenic transcription factors, were markedly decreased by RE. RE also inhibited the expression of PPARgamma at protein levels. RE decreased significantly gene expression of adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (aP2) and leptin, which are adipogenic marker proteins and C/EBPalpha and PPARgamma target genes. These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of RE on adipocyte differentiation might be mediated through the down-regulated expression of adipogenic transcription factors and other specific genes.",

    "abstract": "Our previous study suggested that fenofibrate affects obesity and lipid metabolism in a sexually dimorphic manner in part through the differential activation of hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) in male and female C57BL/6J mice. To determine whether fenofibrate reduces body weight gain and adiposity in female sham-operated (Sham) and ovariectomized (OVX) C57BL/6J mice, the effects of fenofibrate on not only body weight, white adipose tissue (WAT) mass, and food intake, but also the expression of both leptin and PPARalpha target genes were measured. Compared to their respective low-fat diet-fed controls, both Sham and OVX mice exhibited increases in body weight and WAT mass when fed a high-fat diet. Fenofibrate treatment decreased body weight gain and WAT mass in OVX, but not in Sham mice. Furthermore, fenofibrate increased the mRNA levels of PPARalpha target genes encoding peroxisomal enzymes involved in fatty acid beta-oxidation, and reduced apolipoprotein C-III (apo C-III) mRNA, all of which were expressed at higher levels in OVX compared to Sham mice. However, leptin mRNA levels were found to positively correlate with WAT mass, and food intake was not changed in either OVX or Sham mice following fenofibrate treatment. These results suggest that fenofibrate differentially regulates body weight and adiposity due in part to differences in PPARalpha activation, but not to differences in leptin production, between female OVX and Sham mice.",

    "abstract": "Prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) has been shown to negatively regulate adipogenesis. To explore to what extent PGE(2) inhibits the differentiation of cells to adipocytes and to examine whether its effect could be due to EP4 receptor signaling, we used microarrays to analyze the gene expression profiles of 3T3-L1 cells exposed to a differentiation cocktail supplemented with PGE(2), AE1-329 (an EP4 agonist), or vehicle. The differentiation-associated responses in genes such as adipocytokines and enzymes related to lipid metabolism were largely weakened upon PGE(2) treatment. In particular, the expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-alpha, genes playing a central role in adipogenesis, was greatly suppressed. PGE(2) appears to be ineffective to a subclass of insulin target genes such as hexokinase 2 and phosphofructokinase. Similar responses were produced in the differentiation-associated genes upon AE1-329 treatment. These results suggest that PGE(2) inhibits a crucial step of the adipocyte differentiation process by acting on the EP4 receptor in 3T3-L1 cells.",

    "abstract": "Histamine H(1) receptors (H(1)-Rs) are found in peripheral tissues and in regions of the hypothalamus that are concerned with regulating body composition. In the present study, we investigated the detailed mechanisms of histamine H(1)-Rs in the development of obesity. Histamine H(1)-R knockout (H1KO) mice gradually developed mature-onset obesity, which was accompanied by hyperphagia and decreased expression of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) mRNA. Both younger nonobese (12-week-old) and older obese (48-week-old) H1KO mice exhibited impairment of the responsiveness to the leptin. In addition, disruption of the diurnal rhythm of feeding occurred before the onset of obesity in H1KO mice. Correction of these abnormal feeding rhythms by means of scheduled feeding caused a reduction in obesity and associated metabolic disorders in H1KO mice. Furthermore, central administration of a histamine H(1)-R agonist affected feeding behavior, body weight, and c-fos-like immunoreactivity in the hypothalamus. Taken together, these findings suggest that histamine H(1)-Rs are crucial for the regulation of feeding rhythm and in mediating the effects of leptin. Early disruption of H(1)-R-mediated functions in H1KO mice may lead to hyperphagia and decreased expression of UCP-1 mRNA, which may contribute to the development of obesity in these animals. In addition, centrally acting histamine H(1)-R may be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity and related metabolic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a risk factor for breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Leptin, an adipocyte-derived cytokine, elicits proliferative effects in some cell types and potentially stimulates the growth of mammary epithelium. Here we show that leptin induced time- and dose-dependent signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 kinase activation in breast carcinoma cells. Blocking STAT3 phosphorylation with a specific inhibitor, AG490, abolished leptin-induced proliferation of MCF-7 cells, whereas blocking ERK1/2 activation by a specific ERK1/2 kinase inhibitor, U0126, did not result in any significant changes in leptin-induced cell proliferation. Our experiments also showed that one member of the p160 family of steroid receptor coactivators, steroid receptor coactivator (SRC)-1, but not glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) or amplified in breast cancer 1 (AIB1), also functioned in gene transactivation in response to leptin treatment. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments showed that SRC-1 physically interacted with the activation domain of STAT3 and that chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments detected the occupancy of SRC-1, but not GRIP1 or AIB1, on the promoter of STAT3 target genes. Our experiments collectively showed that SRC-1 is involved in STAT3 signaling pathway that is implicated in leptin-stimulated cell growth.",

    "abstract": "The effect of tetradecylmaltoside (TDM) on nasal peptide drug absorption was assessed with four peptides of distinct molecular size: insulin (5.7 kDa), leptin (16 kDa), somatropin (22.1 kDa), and epoetin alfa (30.4 kDa). The nasal uptake of the smallest peptides, insulin and leptin, was significantly increased at a TDM concentration of only 0.06%. The uptake of somatropin was significantly increased when concentrations of 0.125% or more were used. The uptake of the largest peptide, epoetin alfa, was not significantly increased, in the presence of 0.125-0.5% TDM. Light microscopy revealed that formulations containing 0.125% TDM caused moderate alterations in nasal epithelial cell morphology, while higher concentrations of TDM (0.5%), caused more extensive morphological changes. Following treatment with 0.125% TDM, the distribution of cilia was altered and the number of pinocytotic vesicles was increased, at a time that correlated with increased nasal absorption of insulin. Consistent with these findings, FITC-insulin applied nasally in the absence of TDM did not enter nasal epithelial cells, whereas FITC-insulin co-administered with 0.125% TDM was internalized into the cells, with a uniform distribution, consistent with transcellular movement of the peptide through the cells.",

    "title": "Obesity: the integrated roles of environment and genetics.",
    "abstract": "Obesity represents one of the most serious global health issues with approximately 310 million people presently affected. It develops because of a mismatch between energy intake and expenditure that results from behavior (feeding behavior and time spent active) and physiology (resting metabolism and expenditure when active). Both of these traits are affected by environmental and genetic factors. The dramatic increase in the numbers of obese people in Western societies reflects mostly changing environmental factors and is linked to reduced activity and perhaps also increased food intake. However, in all societies and subpopulations, there are both obese and nonobese subjects. These differences are primarily a consequence of genetic factors as is revealed by the high heritability for body mass index. Most researchers agree that energy balance and, hence, body weight are regulated phenomena. There is some disagreement about exactly how this regulation occurs. However, a common model is the lipostatic regulation system, whereby our energy stores generate signals that are compared with targets encoded in the brain, and differences between these drive our food intake levels, activity patterns, and resting and active metabolisms. Considerable advances were made in the last decade in understanding the molecular basis of this lipostatic system. Some obese people have high body weight because they have broken lipostats, but these are a rare minority. This suggests that for the majority of obese people, the lipostat is set at an inappropriately high level. When combined with exposure to an environment where there is ready availability of food at low energy costs to obtain it, obesity develops. The evolutionary background to how such a system might have evolved involves the evolution of social behavior, the harnessing of fire, and the development of weapons that effectively freed humans from the risks of predation. The lipostatic model not only explains why some people become obese whereas others do not, but also allows us to understand why energy-controlled diets do not work. Drug-based solutions to the obesity problem that work with the lipostat, rather than against it, are presently under development and will probably be in regular use within 5-10 y. However, several lines of evidence including genetic mapping studies of quantitative trait loci associated with obesity suggest that our present understanding of the regulatory system is still rudimentary. In particular, we know nothing about how the target body weight in the brain is encoded. As our understanding in this field advances, new drug targets are likely to emerge and allow us to treat this crippling disorder.",

    "title": "Pharmacogenetics of antipsychotic-induced weight gain.",
    "abstract": "Antipsychotic medications have been associated with considerable weight gain. The degree of inter-individual variability and known genetic contributions to obesity suggest a combination of genetic and environmental factors. In the absence of established mechanisms and valid predictors for this relevant adverse effect, pharmacogenetic studies may provide the basis for the development of individualized treatment and preventive interventions. The aim of the present review is to analyze the theoretical and empirical knowledge base for the selection of the most promising target genes that may contribute to antipsychotic-induced weight gain. Examination of the preclinical and clinical literature that can inform the rational choice of target genes that may play a role in the development of adverse changes in body composition associated with antipsychotic treatment. Theoretically, candidate gene selection can be guided by knowledge about molecular pathways associated with obesity, receptors modulated by antipsychotic drugs, and enzymes implicated in their metabolism and bioavailability. While most available data relate to the general mechanisms of obesity and few studies have directly examined the genetic contributions to antipsychotic-induced weight gain, several genes warrant further investigation. These include the 5-HT(2C), pro-opiomelanocortin, leptin, ghrelin, tumor necrosis factor alpha, adiponectin, dopamine D(2) receptor, histamine-H(1) receptor, and alpha(1), beta(2) and beta(3) adrenergic receptor genes. Pharmacogenetic studies can provide powerful tools for the pre-treatment identification of individuals at high risk for antipsychotic-induced weight gain, to uncover biological mechanisms that may even generalize to non-drug-induced weight gain, and to isolate novel targets for treatments of weight gain and obesity. To enhance power, future studies should pay close attention to population selection and avoidance/control of confounds, particularly past treatment exposure.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin represents an adipocyte-specific secretory protein that has been discussed recently as candidate gene and promising new drug target to restore insulin sensitivity in diabetes mellitus type 2. The aim of the present study was to define influencing variables on adiponectin serum levels in a large cohort of caucasian patients with type 1/type 2 diabetes and healthy controls. Additionally, adiponectin gene polymorphisms (Tyr111His and Gly15Gly) were investigated for possible associations with adiponectin serum levels. Adiponectin serum concentrations were measured in a metabolically well characterized cohort of 892 caucasian patients (556 with type 2 diabetes, 118 with type 1 diabetes, 218 controls) by ELISA. Gene polymorphisms were determined by PCR-based RFLP. 1) Adiponectin values are dependent on gender with higher levels in diabetic females than in diabetic males. This gender-specific effect was only restricted to patients with diabetes and cannot be observed in controls. 2) In contrast to previous studies, the presence of diabetes does not influence adiponectin serum levels after correction for BMI. In addition, age has no influence on adiponectin levels. 3) Adiponectin levels are dependent on renal function at a creatinine clearance &lt; 45 ml/min. 4) Regression analysis showed a significant, but only weak correlation between BMI and adiponectin in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 (r = 0.47) and type 1 (r = 0.57). 5) Adiponectin gene polymorphisms (Tyr111His and Gly15Gly) do not influence adiponectin levels. Adiponectin serum concentrations can only be interpreted after careful correction for gender and renal function, whereas the genetic variants Tyr11His and Gly15Gly do not seem to play a role. The correlation between BMI and adiponectin was weaker than expected in diabetic patients.",

    "abstract": "Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone that regulates energy balance and neuroendocrine function primarily by acting on specific hypothalamic pathways. Resistance to the weight reducing effects of leptin is a feature of most cases of human and rodent obesity, yet the molecular basis of leptin resistance is poorly understood. We have previously identified suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (Socs3) as a leptin-induced negative regulator of leptin receptor signaling and potential mediator of leptin resistance. However, due to the non-viability of mice with targeted disruption of Socs3 (ref. 6), the importance of Socs3 in leptin action in vivo was unclear. To determine the functional significance of Socs3 in energy balance in vivo we undertook studies in mice with heterozygous Socs3 deficiency (Socs3(+/-)). We report here that Socs3(+/-) mice display greater leptin sensitivity than wild-type control mice: Socs3(+/-) mice show both enhanced weight loss and increased hypothalamic leptin receptor signaling in response to exogenous leptin administration. Furthermore, Socs3(+/-) mice are significantly protected against the development of diet-induced obesity and associated metabolic complications. The level of Socs3 expression is thus a critical determinant of leptin sensitivity and obesity susceptibility in vivo and this molecule is a potential target for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) used to be considered impermeable to polypeptides. However, this view has evolved rapidly over the past two decades. Not only do polypeptides have the potential to serve as carriers for selective therapeutic agents, but they themselves may directly cross the BBB after delivery into the bloodstream to become potential treatments for a variety of CNS disorders, including neurodegeneration, autoimmune diseases, stroke, depression, and obesity. The interactions of polypeptides with the BBB can take many forms, such as simple diffusion, saturable transport, or facilitation of entry of another peptide or protein. In some instances, interactions in the blood compartment (outside the BBB) or within the endothelial cells (at the BBB level) can significantly impede the passage of polypeptides across the BBB. We shall review the different aspects of interactions between peptides/proteins and the BBB that affect their delivery as potential drugs in their natural form, and discuss recent advances in the cell biology of polypeptide transport across the BBB. Better understanding of the BBB will provide insight and direction for future research in the treatment of CNS disorders.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin (ADP) is an adipocyte hormone involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. We detected a rise in ADP in cerebrospinal fluid after intravenous (i.v.) injection, consistent with brain transport. In contrast to leptin, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of ADP decreased body weight mainly by stimulating energy expenditure. Full-length ADP, mutant ADP with Cys39 replaced with serine, and globular ADP were effective, whereas the collagenous tail fragment was not. Lep(ob/ob) mice were especially sensitive to i.c.v. and systemic ADP, which resulted in increased thermogenesis, weight loss and reduction in serum glucose and lipid levels. ADP also potentiated the effect of leptin on thermogenesis and lipid levels. While both hormones increased expression of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), ADP had no substantial effect on other neuropeptide targets of leptin. In addition, ADP induced distinct Fos immunoreactivity. Agouti (A(y)/a) mice did not respond to ADP or leptin, indicating the melanocortin pathway may be a common target. These results show that ADP has unique central effects on energy homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "During the last 10 years, various adipocytokines have been described which influence insulin sensitivity profoundly and might, therefore, potentially link obesity and insulin resistance. Recently, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 was characterized as a novel adipose-secreted factor upregulated in obesity and insulin resistance that impairs insulin signaling in fat cells in vitro and can be found in atherosclerotic lesions. To clarify expression and regulation of this adipocytokine, MCP-1 mRNA was measured by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction during differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes and after treatment with various hormones known to induce insulin resistance. Interestingly, MCP-1 synthesis was significantly downregulated between 43% and 68% during differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Furthermore, 10 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor alpha, 100 nM insulin, 500 ng/ml growth hormone (GH), and 30 ng/ml interleukin (IL)-6-induced MCP-1 mRNA by up to 124-, 23-, 8-, and 2.5-fold, respectively, in a time-dependent fashion with significant stimulation seen at concentrations as low as 0.5 ng/ml GH and 30 ng/ml IL-6. In contrast, the glucocorticoid dexamethasone potently downregulated MCP-1 with significant suppression detectable at concentrations as low as 3 nM and as early as 2h after effector addition. Studies using pharmacological inhibitors suggested that the positive effects of GH and IL-6 on MCP-1 synthesis are at least in part mediated by janus kinase 2 and p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Taken together, our results show a differential regulation of MCP-1 mRNA by insulin resistance-inducing hormones and support the view that this adipocytokine might be an interesting novel candidate linking insulin resistance, obesity, and atherosclerosis. This adipocytokine could thus be a potential pharmacological target for the treatment of impaired insulin sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "GH excess is characterized by alterations of body composition such as decreased body fat mass; however, scant data are present regarding its effect on serum leptin levels. To better elucidate this topic, leptin secretion was studied in 20 acromegalic patients, before and after 6 months of treatment with somatostatin analogs (SR-lanreotide 30 mg and octreotide LAR). Basal GH, IGF-I, insulin, blood glucose and lipid levels were measured and the area under the curve (AUC) for insulin and glucose and oral glucose insulin sensitivity (OGIS) during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were calculated. After 6 months of somatostatin analogs therapy, a significant reduction in GH and IGF-I plasma levels was observed (p&lt;0.0005, both) with a significant increase of leptin levels (7.4+/-1.3 vs 13.2+/-1.6 ng/ml; p&lt;0.05). Interestingly, the typical correlation of leptin with body mass index (BMI) was not present in active acromegaly, whereas it was restored after somatostatin analogs treatment; moreover, the gender difference in leptin secretion between men and women was preserved in active and controlled acromegaly. In conclusion, the gender-based leptin differences are preserved and leptin secretion/BMI ratio is normalized in acromegalic patients after somatostatin analogs therapy.",

    "abstract": "The role of insulin resistance in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is suggested by laboratory data (hyperinsulinemia and decreased sensitivity to endogenous and exogenous insulin). The clinical association with features of the metabolic syndrome, particularly in the most aggressive stages of the disease, further confirms a causative role. Fat accumulation in the liver may stem either from genetic defects, primarily responsible for insulin resistance, or excessive calorie intake and visceral obesity, and is mediated by adipocytokines (leptin, adiponectin, tumour necrosis factor-alpha). Progression of fatty liver to steatohepatitis may be the result of an imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, triggering the formation of reactive oxygen species and intrahepatic lipid peroxidation. This process may also be promoted or accelerated by pro-oxidant xenobiotics or environmental factors. Insulin resistance provides a target for specific treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver, and insulin-sensitising agents (metformin or thiazolidinediones) as well as lifestyle changes to reduce visceral adiposity are the most promising therapeutic options. Future trials need to be performed in order to test the long-term effectiveness of these treatments on the basis of clinically relevant histological outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The global burden of coronary heart disease (CHD) has led to the introduction of international guidelines to minimize the morbidity and mortality that result from this condition. These guidelines recognize the contribution of multiple risk factors to the development of CHD and advocate a multifaceted approach to treatment. Obesity, particularly visceral adiposity, contributes to the clustering of many other risk factors, such as hypertension, insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia, within individual patients. The molecular mechanisms underlying the metabolic abnormalities induced by visceral adiposity have yet to be fully elucidated; however, adipocytokines such as adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and resistin seem to play an important role in this process. Obesity is a major modifiable CHD risk factor, and the benefits of weight loss are numerous, leading to improvements in several co-morbidities. Guidelines advocate lifestyle changes to correct excess bodyweight and improve the CHD risk factor profile. In addition, pharmacologic therapy is recommended for the management of other risk factors, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia, which may not be adequately controlled by lifestyle changes alone. Lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels is the primary target for drug therapy for CHD prevention, and statins are first-line lipid-modifying therapy. The introduction of more efficacious statins with favorable effects on the lipid profile will optimize the control of dyslipidemia. Combining these new treatments with lifestyle changes and drug therapies for managing other CHD risk factors, as part of a multifaceted approach to treatment, will have benefits for CHD prevention.",

    "abstract": "Protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are considered important therapeutic targets because of their pivotal role as regulators of signal transduction and thus their implication in several human diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and autoimmunity. In particular, PTP1B has been the focus of many academic and industrial laboratories because it was found to be an important negative regulator of insulin and leptin signaling, and hence a potential therapeutic target in diabetes and obesity. As a result, significant progress has been achieved in the design of highly selective and potent PTP1B inhibitors. In contrast, little attention has been given to other potential drug targets within the PTP family. Guided by x-ray crystallography, molecular modeling, and enzyme kinetic analyses with wild type and mutant PTPs, we describe the development of a general, low molecular weight, non-peptide, non-phosphorus PTP inhibitor into an inhibitor that displays more than 100-fold selectivity for PTPbeta over PTP1B. Of note, our structure-based design principles, which are based on extensive bioinformatics analyses of the PTP family, are general in nature. Therefore, we anticipate that this strategy, here applied to PTPbeta, in principle can be used in the design and development of selective inhibitors of many, if not most PTPs.",

    "abstract": "The regulation of TRH gene expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) by leptin is critical for normal function of the thyroid axis in rodents and humans. The TRH neuron in the PVH expresses both leptin and melanocortin-4 receptors, suggesting that both signaling systems may regulate TRH gene expression in vivo. Indeed, the TRH promoter responds to both of these signaling pathways in cell culture through identified cis-acting elements, which include signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 and cAMP-response element binding protein binding sites that mediate leptin and melanocortin responses, respectively. To determine whether leptin signaling can directly target the TRH promoter in vivo, we developed a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to use on leptin-treated animals. After a single injection of leptin in fasting animals, we could detect a significant increase in TRH gene expression in the PVH that correlated well with the induction of phosphorylated-STAT3 in the hypothalamus. Furthermore, using a STAT3 antibody, we could immunoprecipitate the STAT-binding site containing regions of both the TRH promoter and the promoter of the suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 gene, another well-defined target of leptin action. In contrast, upstream regions of these promoters that lack STAT sites were not precipitated. Taken together these experiments demonstrate that STAT3 mediates transcriptional effects of leptin in vivo and that the TRH promoter is a likely direct site of leptin action. In addition, these experiments demonstrate that chromatin immunoprecipitation can be used to characterize leptin-signaling in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Adipose tissue is an important endocrine regulator of glucose metabolism and energy homeostasis. Researches have focused on this tissue not only as a target for pharmacotherapy of obesity and insulin resistance but also as an endocrine tissue with leptin secretion and high insulin sensitivity. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) additionally plays a unique role in thermoregulation through the mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which uncouples oxidative phosphorylation. As a genetic tissue ablation model of BAT, we made transgenic mice expressing herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) driven by the brown adipocyte- specific UCP1 minimal regulatory element. The HSV-TK transgene was expressed specifically in BAT and more than 35% increase of apoptosis was induced by ganciclovir (GCV) treatment. Nevertheless, the expression level was not high enough to induce BAT ablation in GCV-treated adult mice. Importantly, however, we found that brown adipocytes in the periphery of interscapular BAT were transformed into white adipocyte-like unilocular cells. These cells express white adipocyte-specific leptin protein but are different in the ultrastructure of mitochondria from classical white adipocytes. Our data indicates that atrophy of BAT causes transformation into white adipocyte-like cells in the adult mouse and also suggests that further molecular understanding of adipocyte plasticity using our transgenic mouse model might be beneficial for the development of anti-obesity/anti-diabetic therapies.",

    "title": "Leptin impairs insulin signaling in rat adipocytes.",
    "abstract": "Leptin modulates glucose homeostasis by acting as an insulin-sensitizing factor in most insulin target tissues. Nevertheless, insulin-dependent glucose uptake in white adipose tissue decreases after in vivo treatment with leptin. Moreover, elevated leptin concentrations inhibit insulin metabolic effects in adipocytes. Here we studied both, direct and centrally mediated effects of leptin on insulin signaling in rat adipocytes. Adipocyte incubation with low leptin concentrations did not modify the insulin stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). However, at elevated concentrations, leptin impaired insulin-stimulated MAPK activity, glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)3beta phosphorylation, and insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation without altering vanadate stimulation. An increase of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 protein was also observed. Central administration of leptin decreased insulin effects on adipocyte MAPK and GSK3beta phosphorylation. In insulin-resistant aged rats with hyperleptinemia and central leptin resistance, insulin poorly stimulated MAPK and central leptin infusion did not further deteriorate adipocyte insulin responsiveness. Food restriction increased MAPK stimulation by insulin and restored the ability of centrally infused leptin to attenuate adipocyte insulin signaling in aged rats. We conclude that leptin can modulate, in an inhibitory manner, adipocyte insulin signaling by two different ways: as an autocrine signal and, indirectly, through neuroendocrine pathways. These mechanisms may be of relevance in situations of hyperleptinemia, such as aging and/or obesity.",

    "title": "Insulin action on expression of novel adipose genes in healthy and type 2 diabetic subjects.",
    "abstract": "Adipose tissue secretes several molecules that may participate in metabolic cross-talk to other insulin-sensitive tissues. Thus, adipose tissue is a key endocrine organ that regulates insulin sensitivity in other peripheral insulin target tissues. We have studied the expression and acute insulin regulation of novel genes expressed in adipose tissue that are implicated in the control of whole body insulin sensitivity. Expression of adiponectin, c-Cbl-associated protein (CAP), 11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD-1), and sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-1c was determined in subcutaneous adipose tissue from type 2 diabetic and age- and BMI-matched healthy men by real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. Expression of adiponectin, CAP, 11beta-HSD-1, and SREBP-1c was similar between healthy and type 2 diabetic subjects. Insulin infusion for 3 hours did not affect expression of CAP, 11beta-HSD-1, or adiponectin mRNA in either group. However, insulin infusion increased SREBP-1c expression by 80% in healthy, but not in type 2 diabetic, subjects. Our results provide evidence that insulin action on SREBP-1c is dysregulated in adipose tissue from type 2 diabetic subjects. Impaired insulin regulation on gene expression of select targets in adipose tissue may contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "A high-fructose diet (HFD) has been shown to elevate blood pressure (BP) and to decrease insulin sensitivity in rats. Although running exercise can attenuate these phenomena, its effect on target organ protection is not clear. We investigated whether exercise training has renal protective effects in this model. Nine-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats were allocated to groups that received HFD or a control diet (control group) for 15 weeks. At the age of 10 weeks, fructose-fed rats were allocated to groups that were given vehicle (FRU group), temocapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (TEM group), exercise training (EX group; treadmill running), or temocapril plus exercise training (TEM+EX group). BP was higher in the FRU group than in the control group. Exercise training tended to decrease BP and temocapril treatment decreased BP significantly. Proteinuria was similar in the five groups. Plasma leptin concentration and epididymal fat weight were lower in the EX and TEM+EX groups than in the FRU group. In the soleus muscle of the FRU group, the composite ratio of type I fiber was decreased and that of type IIa fiber was increased compared with those in the control group. Both temocapril and exercise training restored these ratios. The glomerular sclerosis index (GSI) was higher in the FRU group than in the control group. GSI was decreased equally in the TEM, EX, and TEM+EX groups and was positively correlated with plasma leptin concentration. The results suggest that exercise training ameliorates glomerular sclerosis through mechanisms other than a reduction in BP.",

    "title": "Effects of leptin and leptin fragments on steroid secretion of freshly dispersed rat adrenocortical cells.",
    "abstract": "The biological actions of leptin on target tissues are mediated via several isoforms of receptors (Ob-Rs), which may differently interact with native leptin and its fragments. Based on the presence in the rat adrenals of at least two Ob-R isoforms and the conflicting findings on the effect of leptin on adrenocortical secretion, we investigated the effects of the native leptin and several leptin fragments (10(-8) and 10(-6)M) on aldosterone and corticosterone secretion from freshly dispersed rat zona glomerulosa (ZG) and zona fasciculata-reticularis (ZF/R) cells. Reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed the expression of Ob-Ra and Ob-Rb mRNAs in both ZG and ZF/R cells. Native murine leptin (1-147) enhanced aldosterone and corticosterone secretion from dispersed ZG and ZF/R cells, and similar effects were elicited by murine leptin fragment 116-130, and human leptin fragments 138-167, 150-167 and [Tyr] 26-39. Human leptin fragment 93-105 was ineffective, while fragment 22-56 decreased corticosterone output without affecting aldosterone secretion. Taken together, our findings indicate that in rat adrenocortical cells leptin and leptin fragments may differently interact with Ob-Rs or interact with different Ob-R isoforms. Moreover, they suggest that (1) the direct adrenocortical secretagogue effect of leptin mainly depends on the C-terminal sequence 116-166; and (2) the N-terminal sequence is not needed for leptin to activate Ob-Rs positively coupled to steroidogenesis, but is possibly responsible for a direct inhibitory effect on glucocorticoid secretion.",

    "abstract": "The adipose tissue produces and secretes many bioactive substances, which we conceptualized as Adipocytokines (Nature Medicine 1996). Adiponectin is a novel adipocytokine, which we identified by screening the adipose-specific genes from human fat. Adiponectin is a secreted protein, the concentration of which reaches as high as 5-15 micrograms/ml in human plasma. Adiponectin mRNA is expressed exclusively in adipose tissues. The adiponectin mRNAs and its plasma levels are reduced in obesity, type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis. Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp studies in humans and monkeys, and several recent studies from others revealed that adiponectin is an insulin-sensitizing hormone. Furthermore, adiponectin exhibited anti-atherogenic moieties, decreasing the attachment of monocytes to endothelial cells through inhibiting the expression levels of adhesion molecules. It reduced the lipid accumulation in macrophages through reducing the expression of scavenger receptor, and inhibited the cytokine-stimulated proliferation of smooth muscle cells. The genetic mutation of the adiponectin gene accompanying hypoadiponectinemia was strongly associated with the incidence of type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis in Japanese subjects. Hypoadiponectinemia was the strongest predictor for the development of type 2 diabetes in humans. Adiponectin knockout mice exhibited diet-induced diabetes and severer atherosclerotic response by vascular injury. Adiponectin supplement reversed the insulin resistance syndrome including diabetes and atherosclerotic change in the knockout mice. We conclude that Hypoadiponectinemia stands upstream of the pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome, hence, can be a direct target of drug intervention to tackle life style-related disease rampant in developed countries.",

    "abstract": "We have investigated if changes in hepatic lipid metabolism produced by old age are related to changes in liver peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha). Our results indicate that 18-month-old rats showed a marked decrease in the expression and activity of liver PPARalpha, as shown by significant reductions in PPARalpha mRNA, protein and binding activity, resulting in a reduction in the relative mRNA levels of PPARalpha target genes, such as liver-carnitine-palmitoyl transferase-I (CPT-I) and mitochondrial medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD). Further, in accordance with a liver PPARalpha deficiency in old rats, treatment of old animals with a therapeutic dose of gemfibrozil (GFB) (3mg/kg per day, 21 days) was ineffective in reducing plasma triglyceride concentrations (TG), despite attaining a 50% reduction in TG when GFB was administered to young animals at the same dose and length of treatment. We hypothesize that the decrease in hepatic PPARalpha can be related to a state of leptin resistance present in old animals.",

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma, a target of TZDs, is expressed abundantly in adipocytes, suggesting an important role for this tissue in the etiology and treatment of IR. Targeted deletion of PPARgamma in adipose tissue resulted in marked adipocyte hypocellularity and hypertrophy, elevated levels of plasma free fatty acids and triglyceride, and decreased levels of plasma leptin and ACRP30. In addition, increased hepatic glucogenesis and IR were observed. Despite these defects, blood glucose, glucose and insulin tolerance, and insulin-stimulated muscle glucose uptake were all comparable to those of control mice. However, targeted mice were significantly more susceptible to high-fat diet-induced steatosis, hyperinsulinemia, and IR. Surprisingly, TZD treatment effectively reversed liver IR, whereas it failed to lower plasma free fatty acids. These results suggest that syndrome X may be comprised of separable PPARgamma-dependent components whose origins and therapeutic sites may reside in distinct tissues.",

    "title": "[Psychiatric disorders and neural mechanisms underlying energy intake and expenditure: a review].",
    "abstract": "Anorexia is one of the common symptoms caused by various psychiatric disorders. Increasing evidence indicates that neuroleptics can induce weight gain, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. However, the mechanisms underlying these conditions have not been fully elucidated. In this review, we describe molecular neuroanatomic aspects of current biology of energy homeostasis that would help to address the psychiatric issues noted above, focusing on the central leptin/melanocortin system. An adipocyte-derived hormone, leptin acts on the arcuate hypothalamic nucleus (Arc) to inhibit feeding behavior and simultaneously to promote energy expenditure. Leptin activates Arc neurons producing alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) and inhibits those producing agouti-related protein (AgRP). alpha-MSH is an endogenous agonist for the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4-R) that is expressed exclusively in the central nervous system (CNS), whereas AgRP acts as a MC4-R antagonist. It is also established that MC4-R blockade produces an over-eating/obesity syndrome in rodents and humans. Thus, MC4-R-expressing neurons are downstream targets of leptin. Of interest, MC4-R-positive neurons densely populate in CNS sites critical for energy homeostasis and associated with psychiatric disorders, including the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus and central amygdaloid nucleus. In addition, Arc alpha-MSH neurons receive serotonergic inputs from raphe neurons. Finally, an AgRP gene polymorphism has been associated with anorexia nervosa. These findings suggest that the central melanocortin system is a target for psychiatry.",

    "title": "Leptin modulates behavioral responses to sweet substances by influencing peripheral taste structures.",
    "abstract": "Leptin is a hormone that regulates body weight homeostasis mainly via the hypothalamic functional leptin receptor Ob-Rb. Recently, we proposed that the taste organ is a new peripheral target for leptin. Leptin selectively inhibits mouse taste cell responses to sweet substances and thereby may act as a sweet taste modulator. The present study further investigated leptin action on the taste system by examining expression of Ob-Rb in taste cells and behavioral responses to sweet substances in leptin-deficient ob/ob, and Ob-Rb-deficient db/db mice and their normal litter mates. RT-PCR analysis showed that Ob-Rb was expressed in taste cells in all strains tested. The db/db mice, however, had a RT-PCR product containing an abnormal db insertion that leads to an impaired shorter intracellular domain. In situ hybridization analysis showed that the hybridization signals for normal Ob-Rb mRNA were detected in taste cells in lean and ob/ob mice but not in db/db mice. Two different behavioral tests, one using sweet-bitter mixtures as taste stimuli and the other a conditioned taste aversion paradigm, demonstrated that responses to sucrose and saccharin were significantly decreased after ip injection of leptin in ob/ob and normal littermates, but not in db/db mice. These results suggest that leptin suppresses behavioral responses to sweet substances through its action on Ob-Rb in taste cells. Such taste modulation by leptin may be involved in regulation for food intake.",

Leptin, mainly secreted by adipocytes, belongs to the helical cytokine family and its plasma concentrations correlate with fat mass and respond to changes in energy balance. Initially, leptin was considered as an anti-obesity hormone, but experimental evidence has also shown pleiotropic effects of this molecule on hematopoiesis, angiogenesis, lymphoid organ homeostasis and T lymphocyte functions. More specifically, leptin links the pro-inflammatory T helper (Th)-1 immune response to the nutritional status and the energy balance. Indeed, decreased leptin concentrations during conditions of food deprivation lead to impaired immune capabilities. This review focuses on the potential therapeutic utilities for agents that manipulate the leptin-adipocyte axis and discusses novel strategies for an immune intervention in pathologic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Two in vivo studies were conducted with pigs to determine the effects of exogenous leptin on the expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR), and on serum concentrations of selected metabolites and hormones. Initially, leptin was administered i.m. to young pigs for 15 days at 0 (control), 0.003 (low), 0.01 (medium) and 0.03 (high) mg. kg(-1). day(-1). There was no leptin effect on serum glucose (P &gt; 0.84), triglycerides (P &gt; 0.69), non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA, P &gt; 0.53), or glycerol (P &gt; 0.33). Leptin at the intermediate and high doses depressed adipose expression of both PPARgamma1 (P &lt; 0.06) and PPARgamma2 (P &lt; 0.01). In a second study, we used a paired-feeding experimental design to determine the effects of a higher dose of leptin (0.05 mg. kg(-1). day(-1)) on serum metabolites and PPAR expression in selected tissues. At this dose, leptin increased (P &lt; 0.0001) serum NEFA concentrations relative to both the ad libitum and pair-fed control groups. However, in this study, there was no difference in the expression of PPARgamma1 in adipose tissue, but PPARgamma2 mRNA was upregulated by leptin (P &lt; 0.08). In contrast, leptin had no impact on the expression of PPARalpha in liver, skeletal muscle or adipose tissue. Adipose tissue explants were also incubated with leptin to assess the effect on PPARgamma expression, in vitro. The abundance of PPARgamma1 mRNA (P &lt; 0.05) was increased after 24 hr of exposure, but the effect of leptin on gamma2 was not significant (P &gt; 0.24). The lipolytic effect of leptin was also evaluated in vitro using isolated adipocytes. In keeping with the increase in serum NEFA concentrations in vivo, leptin stimulated lipolysis in vitro, increasing glycerol concentrations in the medium to about 219% of that in basal (non-treated) culture medium after 8 hr of incubation. Collectively, the data presented herein indicate that leptin modulates lipid metabolism in the pig, but that PPARalpha expression is not a parallel target of leptin as it is in rodent models. The regulation of PPARgamma by leptin seems complex in that it varied in relation to dose in vivo, and may be impacted by in vitro vs. in vivo circumstances.",

The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is highly expressed in adipose tissue and the presumed molecular target for antidiabetic thiazolidinedione drugs that reverse insulin resistance but also promote weight gain. Phosphorylation reduces the activity of PPARgamma in vitro, but physiological relevance has not been demonstrated. We have studied mice homozygous for a mutation (S112A) that prevents PPARgamma phosphorylation. Surprisingly, the weights and adipose mass of PPARgamma-S112A mice are not greater than wild-type. Remarkably, however, genetic prevention of PPARgamma phosphorylation preserves insulin sensitivity in the setting of diet-induced obesity. Underlying this protection are smaller fat cells, elevated serum adiponectin, and reduced free fatty acid levels. Thus, the phosphorylation state of PPARgamma modulates insulin sensitivity. Compounds that prevent PPARgamma phosphorylation or ligands that induce the conformation of nonphosphorylated PPARgamma may selectively enhance insulin sensitivity without increasing body weight.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge of the cannabinoid system and its components has expanded greatly over the past decade. There is increasing evidence for its role in the regulation of food intake and appetite. Cannabinoid system activity in the hypothalamus is thought to contribute to the homeostatic regulation of energy balance, under the control of the hormone leptin. A second component of cannabinoid-mediated food intake appears to involve reward pathways and the hedonic aspect of eating. With the cannabinoid system contributing to both regulatory pathways, it presents an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of both obesity and eating disorders.",

    "abstract": "To test the hypothesis that adipose tissue could be one of the primary targets through which medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) exert their metabolic influence. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a control high-fat diet compared with an isocaloric diet rich in medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs). We determined the effects of MCTs on body fat mass, plasma leptin and lipid levels, acyl chain composition of adipose triglycerides and phospholipids, adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase activity, and the expression of key adipogenic genes. Tissue triglyceride content was measured in heart and gastrocnemius muscle, and whole body insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance were also measured. The effects of MCFAs on lipoprotein lipase activity and adipogenic gene expression were also assessed in vitro using cultured adipose tissue explants or 3T3-L1 adipocytes. MCT-fed animals had smaller fat pads, and they contained a considerable amount of MCFAs in both triglycerides and phospholipids. A number of key adipogenic genes were down-regulated, including peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha and their downstream metabolic target genes. We also found reduced adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase activity and improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in MCT-fed animals. Analogous effects of MCFAs on adipogenic genes were found in cultured rat adipose tissue explants and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These results suggest that direct inhibitory effects of MCFAs on adiposity may play an important role in the regulation of body fat development.",

We aimed to test the hypothesis, that adiponectin provides a missing link between type 2 diabetes and low levels of HDL-cholesterol, independent from common metabolic risk factors. 523 patients with type 2 diabetes were investigated for adiponectin serum levels and parameters of lipid metabolism. Even after correction for age, gender, BMI and fasting insulin concentration, serum levels of adiponectin were highly significant (P&lt;0.0001) and positively (regression analysis: r=0.86) associated with HDL-cholesterol levels in type 2 diabetes. adiponectin seems to predict HDL-cholesterol levels in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2. Low levels of adiponectin are associated with low levels of HDL-cholesterol independently from common metabolic risk factors and therefore represent an independent cardiovascular risk factor in type 2 diabetes. Thus, adiponectin is a potentially new drug target in the treatment of dyslipidaemia.",

    "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been identified as an endothelium-specific mitogen and inducer of angiogenesis and endothelial cell survival. Leptin and hCG have also been suggested as possible regulators of angiogenesis in various models. In-vivo and in-vitro assays revealed that leptin has an angiogenic activity and that the vascular endothelium is a target for leptin. Thus, we hypothesized that products of cytotrophoblastic cells may play a role in placental angiogenesis and we therefore investigated the effects of leptin and hCG on cytotrophoblast VEGF secretion. We incubated cytotrophoblastic cells (CTB) with recombinant human leptin (rhLept) (0-4 pg/ml) or hCG (0-30000 IU/ml) for 4 h. rhLept significantly stimulated hCG (P = 0.0045) and decreased VEGF release (P = 0.0008) by CTB in a concentration-dependent manner. On the other hand, increasing concentrations of hCG (0-30000 IU/ml), induced a significant inhibition of leptin secretion (P = 0.0028) and a marked dose-dependent stimulation of VEGF(165) secretion (P &lt; 0.0001). We observed an increase of &gt;1000-fold in basal trophoblastic VEGF secretion with physiological concentrations of hCG in vitro. An inhibitory effect of hCG on trophoblastic leptin secretion was also observed, suggesting that hCG might exert a possible negative feedback on trophoblastic release of leptin. We hypothesize that trophoblastic products such as hCG and leptin are probably involved in the control of VEGF secretion at the maternal-fetal interface.",

    "abstract": "Galanin-like peptide (GALP) is a novel peptide that has been isolated from the porcine hypothalamus. The expression of GALP mRNA is localized to the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus and is thought to be under the regulation of leptin. First, we confirmed by real-time PCR analysis that sc administration of leptin to Wistar rats under food-deprived conditions resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in hypothalamic GALP mRNA levels. Next, GALP mRNA levels were found to be reduced by 50% in 11-wk-old male Zucker obese rats compared with age-matched Zucker lean rats, whereas neuropeptide Y mRNA levels were increased by 55% and proopiomelanocortin mRNA levels were reduced by 53% in Zucker obese rats. Analysis using a two-site enzyme immunoassay revealed a lower level of hypothalamic GALP immunoreactivity in 11-wk-old Zucker obese rats (5.9 fmol/mg protein) than in age-matched Zucker lean rats (19.6 fmol/mg protein). Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that Zucker obese rats (11 wk old) had a reduced number of GALP immunoreactivity-positive cells (29.4 cells/3 slices) in the arcuate nucleus compared with age-matched Zucker lean rats (115 cells/3 slices). Furthermore, Zucker obese rats showed increased sensitivity to intracerebroventricularly administered GALP compared with Zucker lean rats, in that a lower dose of GALP increased plasma LH levels in male Zucker obese rats, but not in male Zucker lean rats. In addition, a reduction in the level of hypothalamic GALP mRNA was found in db/db and ob/ob mice. The result supports the hypothesis that the hypothalamic GALP gene expression is controlled by leptin signals and suggests possible involvement of GALP in the reproductive abnormalities of the Zucker obese rat.",

There is now evidence showing that leptin exerts some of its metabolic effects acting directly on peripheral tissues. The role of leptin has expanded from a narrow position in obesity to effects on biological processes, such as diabetes, appetite, thermogenesis, the immune system and reproduction. Here in a first part, we review preclinical evidence for direct effects on specific tissues (neurons, liver and muscle) and metabolic pathways. In a second part we review clinical evidence for leptin effects. In particular we review the effects of recombinant human leptin in lean, obese, diabetic subjects and in patients with congenital leptin deficiency or lipoatrophic diabetes. Additionally, while clinic leptin has not shown dramatic effects in obese/diabetic subjects with measurable serum leptin, in states of leptin deficiency treatment with leptin has been shown to have profound effects on body weight and appetite and insulin resistance.",

These cells, using endocrine, paracrine and autocrine pathways, secrete multiple bioactive molecules, conceptualized as adipokines or adipocytokines. This review examines current information in adipobiology of various diseases besides obesity and related diseases such as type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. Finally, we emphasize the possibilities for adipokine-targeted pharmacology in adiponectin (Acrp30, apM1, AdipoQ, GBP28), angiotensin II, estrogens, nerve growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and also adipose mast cells.",

    "abstract": "Leptin acts in the hypothalamus to decrease appetite and increase sympathetic nerve activity. The leptin receptor is known to signal through the janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway to modulate transcription of target genes. Alteration of the activity of phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) by leptin has also been reported, and inhibition of PI3K is known to block the leptin-induced suppression of feeding. We tested the hypothesis that leptin-induced renal sympathetic nerve activation is mediated by PI3K. We evaluated renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) and feeding responses of C57BL/6J mice to intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of leptin in the presence or absence of selective inhibitors of PI3K (LY294002 or wortmannin). As expected, ICV administration of leptin decreased food intake at 4 hours and 24 hours and increased RSNA. Pretreatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 markedly attenuated both the decrease in food intake and the increase in RSNA induced by leptin. Wortmannin also inhibited the RSNA response to leptin. In contrast, PI3K inhibitors did not affect the RSNA response to MTII (melanocortin-3/4 receptor agonist). Our data demonstrate that PI3K appears to play an important role in the transduction of leptin-induced changes in renal sympathetic outflow.",

    "abstract": "Delivery of protein therapeutics often requires frequent injections because of low activity or rapid clearance, thereby placing a burden on patients and caregivers. Using glycoengineering, we have increased and prolonged the activity of proteins, thus allowing reduced frequency of administration. Glycosylation analogs with new N-linked glycosylation consensus sequences introduced into the protein were screened for the presence of additional N-linked carbohydrates and retention of in vitro activity. Suitable consensus sequences were combined in one molecule, resulting in glycosylation analogs of rHuEPO, leptin, and Mpl ligand. All three molecules had substantially increased in vivo activity and prolonged duration of action. Because these proteins were of three different classes (rHuEPO is an N-linked glycoprotein, Mpl ligand an O-linked glycoprotein, and leptin contains no carbohydrate), glycoengineering may be generally applicable as a strategy for increasing the in vivo activity and duration of action of proteins. This strategy has been validated clinically for glycoengineered rHuEPO (darbopoetin alfa).",

    "abstract": "Physiological concentrations of leptin stimulate the activity of the endocannabinoid-degrading enzyme anandamide hydrolase (fatty acid amide hydrolase, FAAH) in human T lymphocytes up to approximately 300% over the untreated controls. Stimulation of FAAH occurred through up-regulation of gene expression at transcriptional and translational levels and involved binding of leptin to its receptor with an apparent dissociation constant (K(d)) of 1.95 +/- 0.14 nm and maximum binding (B(max)) of 392 +/- 8 fmol x mg protein(-1). Leptin binding to the receptor triggered activation of STAT3 but not STAT1 or STAT5 or the mitogen-activated protein kinases p38, p42, and p44. Peripheral lymphocytes of leptin knock-out (ob/ob) mice showed decreased FAAH activity and expression (approximately 25% of the wild-type littermates), which were reversed to control levels by exogenous leptin. Analysis of the FAAH promoter showed a cAMP-response element-like site, which is a transcriptional target of STAT3. Consistently, mutation of this site prevented FAAH activation by leptin in transient expression assays. Electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays further corroborated the promoter activity data. Taken together, these results suggest that leptin, by up-regulating the FAAH promoter through STAT3, enhances FAAH expression, thus tuning the immunomodulatory effects of anandamide. These findings might also have critical implications for human fertility.",

    "abstract": "Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta is a potent inhibitor of adipocyte differentiation. To identify which adipocyte transcription factors might be targeted by TGF-beta, we overexpressed key adipogenic transcription factors, C/EBPbeta, C/EBPdelta, or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma in NIH3T3 cells and tested the ability of TGF-beta to block adipogenesis. We show that TGF-beta inhibits adipocyte differentiation driven by either C/EBPbeta or C/EBPdelta without affecting C/EBP protein expression levels, suggesting that these C/EBPs are a direct target of TGF-beta action. Because TGF-beta inhibits adipogenesis by signaling through Smad3, we examined physical and functional interactions of Smad3 and Smad4 with C/EBPbeta, C/EBPdelta, and PPARgamma2. C/EBPbeta and C/EBPdelta were found to physically interact with Smad3 and Smad4, and Smad3 cooperated with Smad4 and TGF-beta signaling to repress the transcriptional activity of C/EBPs. Thus, repression of the activity of C/EBPs by Smad3/4 at C/EBP binding sites inhibited transcription from the PPARgamma2 and leptin promoters. In contrast, PPARgamma interacted only very weakly with Smad3 and its transcriptional activity was not repressed by Smad3/4 or in response to TGF-beta. Smad3/4 did not reduce the ability of C/EBP to bind to its cognate DNA sequence, but repressed transcription by inhibiting the transactivation function of C/EBP.",

    "title": "Leptin inhibits epileptiform-like activity in rat hippocampal neurones via PI 3-kinase-driven activation of BK channels.",
    "abstract": "The obese gene product, leptin is an important circulating satiety factor that regulates energy balance via its actions in the hypothalamus. However, leptin receptors are also expressed in brain regions not directly associated with energy homeostasis, such as the hippocampus. Here, leptin inhibits hippocampal neurones via activation of large conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (BK) channels, a process that may be important in regulating neuronal excitability. We now show that leptin receptor labelling is expressed on somata, dendrites and axons, and is also concentrated at synapses in hippocampal cultures. In functional studies, leptin potently and reversibly reduces epileptiform-like activity evoked in lean, but not leptin-resistant Zucker fa/fa rats. Furthermore, leptin also depresses enhanced Ca(2+) levels evoked following Mg(2+) removal in hippocampal cultures. The ability of leptin to modulate this activity requires activation of BK, but not K(ATP), channels as the effects of leptin were mimicked by the BK channel activator NS-1619, and inhibited by the BK channel inhibitors, iberiotoxin and charybdotoxin. The signalling mechanisms underlying this process involve stimulation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), but not mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), as two structurally unrelated inhibitors of PI 3-kinase, LY294002 and wortmannin, blocked the actions of leptin. These data indicate that leptin, via PI 3-kinase-driven activation of BK channels, elicits a novel mechanism for controlling neuronal excitability. As uncontrolled excitability in the hippocampus is one underlying cause of temporal lobe epilepsy, this novel action of leptin could provide an alternative therapeutic target in the management of epilepsy.",

    "title": "Inducible ablation of adipocytes in adult transgenic mice expressing the E. coli nitroreductase gene.",
    "abstract": "We describe the use of an enzyme prodrug system based on E. coli nitroreductase (NTR) to achieve the specific ablation of adipose tissue. Transgenic mice expressing the NTR gene specifically in the adipose tissue were generated using the adipocyte specific promoter aP2. After treatment with the prodrug CB1954 these mice showed extensive cell depletion in all fat depots; this was directly correlated to both the dose of prodrug and the levels of NTR expression. Higher doses of CB1954 resulted in complete disappearance of visible adipose stores in some transgenic mice. These mice exhibited an impaired ability to thermoregulate body temperature. Lower doses of CB1954 resulted in a partial reduction of the adipose tissue leaving non-expressing cells that escape ablation. These animals show normal levels of blood glucose and triglycerides but have reduced leptin levels. After 30 days they were able to regenerate the fat depots and leptin levels returned to normal but, interestingly, no NTR-expressing cells were detectable. The present model provides a new approach to manipulate the number of adipocytes at different stages of mouse development and provides a new system for the study of fat metabolism especially in abnormal conditions such as obesity and its modulation through manipulation of the target cell population.",

    "abstract": "1. Leptin, a pleiotropic hormone believed to regulate body weight, has recently been associated with inflammatory states and immune activity. Here we have studied the effect of leptin on expression of IFN-gamma-induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2), both prominent markers of macrophage activation, using the murine macrophage J774A.1 cell line. 2. After 24 h of incubation, leptin (1-10 micro g ml(-1)) potently synergized with IFN-gamma (100 U ml(-1)) in nitric oxide (NO) release, evaluated as nitrite and nitrate (NO(x)), and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) production in culture medium. 3. The observed increase of NO and PGE(2) was related to enhanced expression of the respective inducible enzyme isoforms, measured in mRNA and protein by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. 4. When cells were stimulated only with leptin, a weak induction of NO and PGE(2) release and of the expression of related inducible enzymes was observed. 5. Moreover IFN-gamma increased the expression of the functional form of leptin receptor (Ob-Rb) and this effect was potentiated by leptin in a concentration-dependent manner. 6. These data suggest that macrophages, among the peripheral immune cells, represent a target for leptin and confirm the relevance of this hormone in the pathophysiology of inflammation.",

    "title": "Tissue-specific effects of chronic dietary leucine and norleucine supplementation on protein synthesis in rats.",
    "abstract": "Acute administration of leucine and norleucine activates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) cell-signaling pathway and increases rates of protein synthesis in a number of tissues in fasted rats. Although persistent stimulation of mTOR signaling is thought to increase protein synthetic capacity, little information is available concerning the effects of chronic administration of these agonists on protein synthesis, mTOR signal transduction, or leucine metabolism. Hence, we developed a model of chronic leucine/norleucine supplementation via drinking water and examined the effects of chronic (12 days) supplementation on protein synthesis in adipose tissue, kidney, heart, liver, and skeletal muscle from ad libitum-fed rats. The relative concentration of proteins involved in mTOR signaling and the two initial steps in leucine oxidation were also examined. Leucine or norleucine supplementation was accompanied by increased rates of protein synthesis in adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle, but not in heart or kidney. Supplementation was not associated with increases in the anabolic hormones insulin or insulin-like growth factor I. Chronic supplementation did not cause apparent adaptation in either components of the mTOR cell-signaling pathway that respond to leucine (mTOR, ribosomal protein S6 kinase, and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1) or the first two steps in leucine metabolism (the mitochondrial isoform of branched-chain amino acid transaminase, branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase, and branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase kinase), which may be involved in terminating the signal from leucine. These results suggest that provision of leucine or norleucine supplementation via the drinking water results in stimulation of postprandial protein synthesis in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver without notable adaptive changes in signaling proteins or metabolic enzymes.",

    "abstract": "Leptin is known to be an important circulating signal for regulation of food intake and body weight. These effects were suggested to be mediated through the hypothalamic center via the Ob-Rb receptor (long isoform of leptin receptor). Although short isoforms of leptin receptor exist in many regions of the brain, there has been little in vivo functional study of these areas such as for leptin's target site. We report here that peripherally applied leptin increased interleukin (IL)-1beta transcripts in many regions of the brain such as the hypothalamus, the hippocampus, the cortex, the cerebellum and the brainstem. Although leptin did not induce STAT3 activation or suppressor of cytokine signaling3 (SOCS3) expression in the hypothalamus of the db/db mice, which lack a functional Ob-Rb receptor, leptin increased the IL-1beta levels to similar extents as normal mice. Therefore, a novel function of leptin is suggested as the induction of IL-1beta expression in many regions of the brain via STAT3-independent mechanisms.",

Although leptin receptors exist in many regions of the brain, there have been few in vivo functional studies of leptin's target site other than the hypothalamus. We report here that peripherally applied leptin increased STAT3 phosphorylation not only in the hypothalamus but also in the brain stem as assessed by Western blotting. Moreover, administration of leptin induced expression of the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 mRNA, a negative feedback regulator of leptin signaling, in the brain stem as well as in the hypothalamus. Using immunohistochemistry, we observed phosphorylated STAT3-immunoreactive cells in the arcuate nucleus, ventromedial hypothalamus, lateral hypothalamic area of the hypothalamus, and the nucleus of the tractus solitarius, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, lateral parabrachial nucleus, and central gray of the brain stem of leptin-injected mice. These findings represent physiologically functional leptin Ob-Rb receptor in the brain stem as well as in the hypothalamus. It is suggested that circulating leptin may directly act in the brain stem to elicit autonomic and neuroendocrine control of food intake and energy expenditure.",

    "title": "Strategies for the delivery of leptin to the CNS.",
    "abstract": "Leptin is the major regulator of body fat. It is a 16 kD protein released by fat cells into the blood and crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to interact with its receptors at the arcuate nucleus to affect feeding, thermogenesis, and other functions. Within normal and obese body weight ranges, serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of leptin directly correlate with body mass index and adiposity. In animals, leptin at high levels exerts effects on appetite and at low levels informs the brain when fat reserves are adequate to switch behavioral, endocrine, and immune functions from starvation mode. Leptin offers a unique therapeutic opportunity for conditions related to body weight control, such as reversal of obesity and anorexia, and as an indirect treatment for diseases related to being over- or under-weight, such as insulin resistant diabetes and the endocrine changes accompanying starvation. In humans and in many rodent models, obesity may be a consequence of leptin resistance. More specifically, resistance likely results from an impaired transport of leptin across the BBB. Peripheral administration of native leptin results in weight reduction in moderately obese individuals and weight loss and reversal of insulin resistance and dyslipidemia in individuals with low leptin levels. The peripheral pharmacokinetic and BBB transport characteristics of native leptin suggests strategies for improving the therapeutic profile of leptin. These strategies include the development of longer lasting and more permeable analogs, development of antagonists, enhancing the activity of the leptin transporter, and delivering leptin by intrathecal administration.",

    "title": "Factors contributing to higher hematocrit levels in hemodialysis patients not receiving recombinant human erythropoietin.",
    "abstract": "Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) is used to correct anemia in the majority of hemodialysis patients, but a few patients can maintain greater hematocrits without the use of rHuEPO. We aim to investigate which factors stimulate erythropoiesis, other than rHuEPO, in hemodialysis patients. One hundred fifty-eight patients undergoing regular hemodialysis treatment participated in a cross-sectional study. To keep the target hematocrit of 30%, 133 patients (84%) were administered rHuEPO, but 25 patients (16%) did not need rHuEPO. Mean hematocrits were 33.4% +/- 4.6% in patients who did not need rHuEPO and 30.9% +/- 4.0% in those administered rHuEPO. In the analysis of factors contributing to the lack of requirement of rHuEPO with multivariate logistic regression analysis, years on dialysis therapy and body mass index (BMI) were determined to be independent factors with odds ratios of 1.12 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 1.23; P = 0.02) and 1.36 (95% CI, 1.13 to 1.63; P = 0.001), respectively. Neither serum erythropoietin level, albumin concentration, nor normalized protein catabolic rate contributed to the lack of requirement of rHuEPO. BMI correlated closely with log serum leptin level (r = 0.55; P &lt; 0.0001), and log serum leptin level correlated inversely with rHuEPO dose (r = -0.18; P = 0.03). These results indicate that 16% of hemodialysis patients could maintain greater hematocrits without the administration of rHuEPO, and independently contributing factors were greater BMI and more years on hemodialysis therapy. Regarding nutritional parameters, a relatively greater BMI, possibly through effects of greater leptin levels, may stimulate erythropoiesis in uremic patients even in the absence of sufficient erythropoietin production.",

    "title": "The neuropeptide Y Y1 receptor regulates leptin-mediated control of energy homeostasis and reproductive functions.",
    "abstract": "The orexigenic neurotransmitter neuropeptide Y (NPY) plays a central role in the hypothalamic control of food intake and energy balance. NPY also exerts an inhibition of the gonadotrope axis that could be important in the response to poor metabolic conditions. In contrast, leptin provides an anorexigenic signal to centrally control the body needs in energy. Moreover, leptin contributes to preserve adequate reproductive functions by stimulating the activity of the gonadotrope axis. It is of interest that hypothalamic NPY represents a primary target of leptin actions. To evaluate the importance of the NPY Y1 and Y5 receptors in the downstream pathways modulated by leptin and controlling energy metabolism as well as the activity of the gonadotrope axis, we studied the effects of leptin administration on food intake and reproductive functions in mice deficient for the expression of either the Y1 or the Y5 receptor. Furthermore, the role of the Y1 receptor in leptin resistance was determined in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice bearing a null mutation in the NPY Y1 locus. Results point to a crucial role for the NPY Y1 receptor in mediating the NPY pathways situated downstream of leptin actions and controlling food intake, the onset of puberty, and the maintenance of reproductive functions.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine if long-term leptin treatment desensitizes leptin signal transduction and the subsequent downstream anorexic and thermogenic responses in normal and leptin-resistant age-related obese rats. To this end, we administered, i.c.v., recombinant adeno-associated virus encoding rat leptin cDNA (rAAV-leptin) or control virus into young and aged-obese rats and after 9 or 46 days, examined food intake, oxygen consumption, body weight, serum leptin, STAT3 phosphorylation, hypothalamic NPY and POMC mRNAs, and UCP1 expression and protein level in brown adipose tissue (BAT). In young rats, rAAV-leptin depleted body fat and both anorexic and thermogenic mechanisms contributed to this effect. Moreover, leptin signal transduction was not desensitized, and there were persistent physiological responses. Similarly, in the aged-obese rats, there was unabated leptin signal transduction, however, both the anorexic and thermogenic responses completely attenuated sometime after day 9. This attenuation, downstream of the leptin receptor, may be contributing to the leptin-resistance and age-related weight gain in these aged-obese rats. Finally, in young rats, although the initial responses to rAAV-leptin were dominated by anorexic responses, by 46 days, the predominant response was thermogenic rather than anorexic, suggesting that energy expenditure may be an important component of long-term weight maintenance.",

    "title": "Effects of continuous lumbar intrathecal infusion of leptin in rats on weight regulation.",
    "abstract": "Intracranial leptin alters food consumption and body weight. To systematically characterize the effects of extended continuous spinal intrathecal delivery on such regulation, female rats received continuous lumbar spinal infusion (14 days) through catheters connected to osmotic minipumps of a vehicle or one of several doses of recombinant murine leptin (0.03-10 microg/day). The following observations were made. (1) Leptin resulted in a dose-dependent suppression in body weight and food consumption at doses above 0.3 microg/day. (2) Food consumption was initially reduced. Weight fell for 7 days and then plateaued at a level proportional to dose. (3) The ratio of food consumed to body weight was constant for control animals across the study. Leptin-infused rats slowed the initial fall in weight by increasing food consumption, such that the food to body weight ratio returned to that of control values. Rats were thus regulating food consumption to sustain body weight as defined by leptin dose. (4) On day 14, cisternal cerebrospinal fluid was obtained and leptin measured. Concentrations covaried in a log linear fashion with infusion dose. Body weight and food consumption covaried similarly with cisternal leptin concentrations across dose groups. Our data suggest that steady state infusions of leptin induce a degree of appetite suppression that leads to a steady state level of body weight loss and not simply to a simple block of consumatory behavior. The unexpected potency of the observed effects of intrathecal leptin relative to doses that are required after i.c.v. delivery suggests that at least a portion of the effects of intrathecal leptin may reflect a medullary action. The observed correlation of cisternal leptin levels with the behavioral effects is also consistent with a reliable distribution of the infused leptin to target supraspinal sites.",

    "abstract": "The interrelationship between insulin and leptin resistance in young Fischer 344 (F344) rats was studied. Young F344 and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were fed regular chow. F344 animals had two- to threefold higher insulin and triglyceride concentrations and increased stores of triglycerides within liver and muscle. F344 animals gained more body fat. Both acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I gene expression were 20-50% less in F344 animals than in age-matched SD animals. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha gene expression was reduced in 70-day-old F344 animals. Finally, resistin gene expression was similar in 70-day-old SD and F344 animals. Resistin gene expression increased fivefold in F344 animals and twofold in SD animals from 70 to 130 days, without a change in insulin sensitivity. We conclude that young F344 animals have both insulin and leptin resistance, which may lead to diminished fatty oxidation and accumulation of triglycerides in insulin-sensitive target tissues. We did not detect a role for resistin in the etiology of insulin resistance in F344 animals.",

    "title": "Leptin concentrations are increased in subjects treated with clozapine or conventional antipsychotics.",
    "abstract": "Overweight is a considerable clinical problem in patients treated with antipsychotic agents. Recent results suggest that insulin resistance with increased insulin levels is also associated with treatment with the atypical antipsychotic agent clozapine. Leptin is important for the control of body weight and has been proposed to be a link between obesity and the insulin resistance syndrome. This study examined if clozapine-treated subjects and subjects treated with conventional antipsychotics had increased leptin levels compared with the general population and whether there was a gender difference in this respect. Clozapine-treated patients (N = 41), patients treated with conventional antipsychotic drugs (N = 62), and healthy subjects from the Northern Sweden Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease (MONICA) project (N = 189) were investigated with a cross-sectional study design. Weight, body mass index (BMI), and plasma leptin concentrations were measured, and all study subjects were investigated for the presence of diabetes mellitus. Drug treatment, health status, and smoking habits were registered. After adjustment for gender, BMI, smoking habits, age, and diabetes, hyperleptinemia was independently (p &lt; .001) associated with clozapine treatment and with treatment with conventional antipsychotics (p &lt; .005) within a multiple regression analysis. In separate multiple regression analyses, leptin levels were significantly associated with clozapine treatment in men (p = .002) and women (p =.023) and with conventional antipsychotic treatment in men (p = .027) but not in women. Treatment with clozapine as well as with conventional antipsychotics is associated with increased levels of circulating leptin. Hyperleptinemia can be an important link in the development of overweight and the insulin resistance syndrome in subjects receiving antipsychotic drugs, especially atypical agents like clozapine.",

    "title": "Evidence that the caudal brainstem is a target for the inhibitory effect of leptin on food intake.",
    "abstract": "Three experiments were performed to investigate the hypothesis that leptin action within the caudal brain stem (CBS) contributes to its intake inhibitory effects. The first experiment evaluated the anatomical distribution of leptin receptor mRNA in rat CBS using a sensitive fluorescence in situ hybridization method with a riboprobe specific for the long form of the leptin receptor (Ob-Rb). An Ob-Rb mRNA hybridization signal was detected in neurons of several CBS nuclei involved in the control of food intake, including the dorsal vagal complex and parabrachial nucleus. A strong hybridization signal was also obtained from neuronal cell bodies of a number of other structures including the hypoglossal, trigeminal, lateral reticular, and cochlear nuclei; locus ceruleus; and inferior olive. The anatomical profile revealed by fluorescence in situ hybridization was in good agreement with immunocytochemical analysis with an antibody specific to Ob-Rb. In a second experiment, exploring the relevance of CBS Ob-Rb to feeding behavior, rats were given a fourth intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of leptin (0.1, 0.83, or 5.0 microg; n = 9-11/group) or vehicle 30 min before lights-out on three consecutive days. The two higher doses reduced food intake significantly at 2, 4, and 24 h after injection and caused significant reductions of body weight. The dose-response profiles for fourth i.c.v. administration were indistinguishable from those obtained from separate groups of rats that received leptin via a lateral i.c.v. cannula. In the last experiment, a ventricle-subthreshold dose of leptin (0.1 microg) microinjected unilaterally into the dorsal vagal complex suppressed food intake at 2, 4, and 24 h. The results indicate that the CBS contains neurons that are potentially direct targets for the action of leptin in the control of energy homeostasis.",

    "title": "Pharmacology of appetite suppression: implication for the treatment of obesity.",
    "abstract": "Given the current global epidemic of obesity there is a demand for new anti-obesity drugs to overcome the problem. Many pharmacological agents reduce food intake and significantly decrease body mass when administered to animals but affect feeding behaviour in a profoundly different way indicating the variety of biological mechanisms by which such agents act (appetite verses non-appetite). More limited clinical data demonstrates that some of the same drugs produce decreases in food intake and weight loss in humans. A few of these drugs do so by modifying the functioning of the appetite system as measured by subjective changes in feelings of hunger and fullness (indices of satiety). These drugs that modify the daily flux of appetite could be considered as 'appetite suppressants' with clinical potential as anti-obesity agents. Drugs that can be considered suitable candidates for appetite suppressants are agents that enhance peripherally satiety peptide systems (such as CCK, Bombesin/GRP, Enterostatin and GLP-1), alter the CNS levels of various hypothalamic neuropeptides (NPY, Galanin, Orexin, CART and Melanocortins) or monoamine neurotransmitters (such as serotonin, nor-adrenaline and possibly dopamine). Recently, the hormone leptin has become regarded as a key hormonal signal linking adipose tissue status with a number of key central nervous system circuits (NPY, CART, CRF, Melanocortins and possibly Orexins). This tonic system may also provide drug targets for the control of appetite. Any changes induced by a potential appetite suppressant should be considered in terms of the (i) psychological experience and behavioural expression of appetite, (ii) metabolism and peripheral physiology, and (iii) functioning of CNS neural pathways. In humans, such modulation of appetite will involve changes in total caloric consumption, subjective changes in feelings of hunger and fullness, preferences for specific food items, and general macronutrient preferences. These may be expressed behaviourally as changes in meal patterns, snacking behaviour and food choice. Within the next 20 years it is certain that clinicians will have a new range of anti-obesity compounds available to choose from. Such novel compounds may act on a single component of the appetite system or target a combination of these components detailed in this review. Such compounds used in combination with life style changes and dietary intervention may be critical in dealing with the rising world epidemic of obesity.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of the adipose-derived hormone leptin has generated interest in the interaction between peripheral signals and brain targets involved in the regulation of feedings and energy balance. Potential anti-obesity drugs can be based on any intervention between the neuropeptide and its receptor that would alter the biological responses mediated by the neuronal network, in particular, food intake, metabolism and energy expenditure. Modulation of neurons in the arcuate nucleus by leptin results in reduced expression of neuropeptide Y and agouti-related protein, and increased expression of pro-opiomelanocortin (the precursor of a-melanocyte-stimulating hormone) and cocaine- and amphetamine- regulated transcript. Whether leptin finds its way into general usage as an anti-obesity drug, the use of modern methods to identify and target the components of leptin signaling pathway will form the basis for new pharmacological approaches to the treatment of obesity.",

    "title": "The effect of leptin on Na(+)-H(+) antiport (NHE 1) activity of obese and normal subjects erythrocytes.",
    "abstract": "Obesity is currently considered as a chronic metabolic disease, associated with a high risk of cardiovascular complications. Leptin, an adipocyte-derived hormone has a variety target cells influencing a wide range of processes. Possible counteractions of hyperleptinaemia are currently investigated. The Na(+)-H(+) exchanger (NHE 1) is involved in multiple cellular functions and its activation has been related to hypertension and obesity. NHE 1 is present on erythrocytes and can be stimulated by various hormones. Erythrocytes have on their surface a variety of receptors with mostly unknown function. In the present paper, the effect of leptin on erythrocytes NHE 1 activity has been investigated. For this reason, the intracellular pH and sodium influxes were measured before and after addition of leptin in erythrocyte suspensions from normal and obese individuals. Amiloride, a specific NHE 1 inhibitor, and staurosporine a protein kinase C inhibitor were used to inhibit erythrocyte NHE 1. For the binding study leptin was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and the binding on erythrocytes was estimated by Scatchard analysis. NHE 1 activity increased in the presence of leptin but significantly less in the obese than in the control group. Furthermore the concentrations of leptin binding sites on the surface of erythrocytes were lower in erythrocytes drawn from obese individuals than in erythrocytes drawn from normal subjects. Since NHE 1 activity has been associated with insulin resistance and hypertension, the activation of this antiport by leptin may represent a link between adipose tissue hypertrophy and cardiovascular complications of obesity.",

    "title": "GABAergic nature of hypothalamic leptin target neurones in the ventromedial arcuate nucleus.",
    "abstract": "Leptin is an adipose tissue-derived cytokine hormone, which reduces body weight via interactions with hypothalamic neurones. Leptin receptors capable of activating the JAK-STAT signal transduction pathway are expressed at high levels in the hypothalamus, particularly in the arcuate nucleus. In order to identify the chemical mediators of leptin's action in the hypothalamus, we have examined whether GABA neurones of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus contain leptin receptors and the leptin-activated transcription factor STAT3. GABAergic neurones, as visualized by antisera to the GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and GABA, were demonstrated in the ventromedial and ventrolateral parts of the arcuate nucleus. GABA neurones in the ventromedial arcuate nucleus were shown to contain leptin receptor immunoreactivity, as revealed using an antiserum generated to a sequence common to all isoforms of the leptin receptor (Ob-R), as well as an antiserum generated to the carboxy-terminal end of the long leptin receptor (Ob-Rb), and immunoreactivity for the leptin-induced signal transduction molecule STAT3. Ventromedial GABA neurones were also shown to contain neuropeptide Y, whereas ventrolateral proopiomelanocortin-containing neurones lacked GAD and GABA immunoreactivity. Levels of mRNA for GAD65, GAD67 and the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) were analysed in the arcuate nucleus of leptin-deficient ob/ob mice and lean control mice by in situ hybridization. No significant differences in GAD65, GAD67 or VGAT mRNA were detected in the arcuate nucleus of ob/ob mice as compared to lean control mice. The presence of leptin receptor and STAT3 in GABAergic arcuate neurones, but absence of changes in gene transcription for GAD and VGAT mRNA suggests, that leptin does not transcriptionally regulate the expression of proteins involved in GABAergic transmission in arcuate neurones. However, mechanisms other than transcriptional regulation for leptin to influence arcuate GABA neurones may exist.",

    "abstract": "Leptin is secreted by adipocytes and regulates appetite through interaction with hypothalamic leptin receptors (OB-R). Leptin is involved in the stimulation of reproductive functions, and local expression of leptin and OB-R in the ovary, oocyte, embryo, and placenta might play a role in early development. The mRNA and protein of the long form leptin receptor (OB-R(L)) but not of leptin are expressed in the human endometrium and the abundance of OB-R mRNA expression varies during the menstrual cycle with a peak in the early secretory phase. We examined the steroidal regulation of OB-R(L) mRNA expression. Northern blot analyses showed that in organ-cultured proliferative endometrial specimens, oestradiol (10(-9) and 10(-8) mol/l) had no acute effect on the OB-R(L) mRNA expression, whereas oestradiol plus progesterone (10(-8), 10(-7) and 10(-6) mol/l) or medroxyprogesterone acetate (10(-8) and 10(-7) mol/l) suppressed the expression by approximately 50%. This progestin-induced suppression was blocked by a concomitant addition of mifepristone. Additionally, incubation of endometrial specimens in the presence of leptin resulted in the phosphorylation of its intracellular target, STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3). These results indicate that, in the human endometrium, progestins act via the progesterone receptors to suppress functional OB-R(L) mRNA expression, and may thereby alter the sensitivity of the endometrium to leptin.",

    "title": "Effects of estrogen on leptin gene promoter activation in MCF-7 breast cancer and JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells: selective regulation via estrogen receptors alpha and beta.",
    "abstract": "Leptin is a potential regulator of conceptus development. We have previously suggested that in primate pregnancy, leptin biosynthesis is regulated by estrogen in a tissue-specific manner. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to determine the mechanism of estrogen action on LEP promoter activation in divergent cell types. The effects of estrogen were investigated in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells and in ER-negative JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells. Cells were transfected with a leptin-luciferase or an estrogen responsive element (ERE)-luciferase reporter construct, in conjunction with ERalpha, ERbeta, or empty vector expression plasmids. Cells were treated with estradiol and/or the specific estrogen antagonists, ICI-182,780 or 4-hydroxytamoxifen. In MCF-7 cells, estradiol stimulated (P&lt;0.05) ERE-luciferase activity and was inhibited by ICI-182,780, but did not stimulate leptin-luciferase activity. However, leptin-luciferase was stimulated by estradiol (P&lt;0.05) and inhibited by antiestrogens in JEG-3 cells that were co-transfected with ERalpha. Both antiestrogens stimulated leptin-luciferase activity (P&lt;0.05) in JEG-3 cells co-transfected with ERbeta. Results suggested that LEP promoter activation may depend upon co-activators present in leptin-producing cells and may be inhibited by repressors present in non-leptin producing cells. Divergent effects of estrogen may be owed to differences in the type of ER (alpha or beta) expressed in target tissues.",

    "title": "Leptin enhances the calcification of vascular cells: artery wall as a target of leptin.",
    "abstract": "Leptin, the product of the ob gene, regulates food intake, energy expenditure, and other physiological functions of the peripheral tissues. Leptin receptors have been identified in the hypothalamus and in extrahypothalamic tissues. Increased circulating leptin levels have been correlated with cardiovascular disease, obesity, aging, infection with bacterial lipopolysaccharide, and high-fat diets. All these conditions have also been correlated with increased vascular calcification, a hallmark of atherosclerotic and age-related vascular disease. In addition, the differentiation of marrow osteoprogenitor cells is regulated by leptin. Thus, we hypothesized that leptin may regulate the calcification of vascular cells. In this report, we tested the effects of leptin on a previously characterized subpopulation of vascular cells that undergo osteoblastic differentiation and calcification in vitro. When treated with leptin, these calcifying vascular cells had a significant 5- to 10-fold increase in alkaline phosphatase activity, a marker of osteogenic differentiation of osteoblastic cells. Prolonged treatment with leptin enhanced the calcification of these cells, further supporting the pro-osteogenic differentiation effects of leptin. Furthermore, the presence of the leptin receptor on calcifying vascular cells was demonstrated using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, immunocytochemistry, and Western blot analysis. We also identified the presence of leptin receptor in the mouse artery wall, localized to subpopulations of medial and adventitial cells, and the expression of leptin by artery wall cells and atherosclerotic lesions in mice. Taken together, these results suggest that leptin regulates the osteoblastic differentiation and calcification of vascular cells and that the artery wall may be an important peripheral tissue target of leptin action.",

    "abstract": "Most endocrine hormones are produced in tissues and organs with permeable microvessels that may provide an excess of hormones to be transported by the blood circulation to the distal target organ. Here, we investigate whether leptin, an endocrine hormone, induces the formation of vascular fenestrations and permeability, and we characterize its angiogenic property in the presence of other angiogenic factors. We provide evidence that leptin-induced new blood vessels are fenestrated. Under physiological conditions, capillary fenestrations are found in the leptin-producing adipose tissue in lean mice. In contrast, no vascular fenestrations were detected in the adipose tissue of leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. Thus, leptin plays a critical role in the maintenance and regulation of vascular fenestrations in the adipose tissue. Leptin induces a rapid vascular permeability response when administrated intradermally. Further, leptin synergistically stimulates angiogenesis with fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the two most potent and commonly expressed angiogenic factors. These findings demonstrate that leptin has another new function-the increase of vascular permeability.",

    "title": "Insulin and leptin acutely regulate cholesterol ester metabolism in macrophages by novel signaling pathways.",
    "abstract": "Leptin is produced in adipose tissue and acts in the hypothalamus to regulate food intake. However, recent evidence also indicates a potential for direct roles for leptin in peripheral tissues, including those of the immune system. In this study, we provide direct evidence that macrophages are a target tissue for leptin. We found that J774.2 macrophages express the functional long form of the leptin receptor (ObRb) and that this becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated after stimulation with low doses of leptin. Leptin also stimulates both phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 in these cells. We investigated the effects of leptin on hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), which acts as a neutral cholesterol esterase in macrophages and is a rate-limiting step in cholesterol ester breakdown. Leptin significantly increased HSL activity in J774.2 macrophages, and these effects were additive with the effects of cAMP and were blocked by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. Conversely, insulin inhibited HSL in macrophages, but unlike adipocytes, this effect did not require PI 3-kinase. These results indicate that leptin and insulin regulate cholesterol-ester homeostasis in macrophages and, therefore, defects in this process caused by leptin and/or insulin resistance could contribute to the increased incidence of atherosclerosis found associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes.",

    "title": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ligands inhibit adipocyte 11beta -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 expression and activity.",
    "abstract": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) has been shown to play an important role in the regulation of expression of a subclass of adipocyte genes and to serve as the molecular target of the thiazolidinedione (TZD) and certain non-TZD antidiabetic agents. Hypercorticosteroidism leads to insulin resistance, a variety of metabolic dysfunctions typically seen in diabetes, and hypertrophy of visceral adipose tissue. In adipocytes, the enzyme 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD-1) converts inactive cortisone into the active glucocorticoid cortisol and thereby plays an important role in regulating the actions of corticosteroids in adipose tissue. Here, we show that both TZD and non-TZD PPARgamma agonists markedly reduced 11beta-HSD-1 gene expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. This diminution correlated with a significant decrease in the ability of the adipocytes to convert cortisone to cortisol. The half-maximal inhibition of 11beta-HSD-1 mRNA expression by the TZD, rosiglitazone, occurred at a concentration that was similar to its K(d) for binding PPARgamma and EC(50) for inducing adipocyte differentiation thereby indicating that this action was PPARgamma-dependent. The time required for the inhibitory action of the TZD was markedly greater for 11beta-HSD-1 gene expression than for leptin, suggesting that these genes may be down-regulated by different molecular mechanisms. Furthermore, whereas regulation of PPARgamma-inducible genes such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was maintained when cellular protein synthesis was abrogated, PPARgamma agonist inhibition of 11beta-HSD-1 and leptin gene expression was ablated, thereby supporting the conclusion that PPARgamma affects the down-regulation of 11beta-HSD-1 indirectly. Finally, treatment of diabetic db/db mice with rosiglitazone inhibited expression of 11beta-HSD-1 in adipose tissue. This decrease in enzyme expression correlated with a significant decline in plasma corticosterone levels. In sum, these data indicate that some of the beneficial effects of PPARgamma antidiabetic agents may result, at least in part, from the down-regulation of 11beta-HSD-1 expression in adipose tissue.",

    "title": "The hormone resistin links obesity to diabetes.",
    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that leads to complications including heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, blindness and nerve damage. Type 2 diabetes, characterized by target-tissue resistance to insulin, is epidemic in industrialized societies and is strongly associated with obesity; however, the mechanism by which increased adiposity causes insulin resistance is unclear. Here we show that adipocytes secrete a unique signalling molecule, which we have named resistin (for resistance to insulin). Circulating resistin levels are decreased by the anti-diabetic drug rosiglitazone, and increased in diet-induced and genetic forms of obesity. Administration of anti-resistin antibody improves blood sugar and insulin action in mice with diet-induced obesity. Moreover, treatment of normal mice with recombinant resistin impairs glucose tolerance and insulin action. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by adipocytes is enhanced by neutralization of resistin and is reduced by resistin treatment. Resistin is thus a hormone that potentially links obesity to diabetes.",

    "title": "Effect of Sandostatin LAR on serum leptin levels in patients with acromegaly.",
    "abstract": "Serum leptin levels are decreased in patients with acromegaly and rise after GH is normalized by surgical treatment. We have evaluated the effect of Sandostatin LAR on leptin levels in acromegalic patients since there are recent data to suggest that somatostatin, in addition to its GH lowering effect, also reduces serum leptin levels in humans. Nineteen patients with active acromegaly were studied. Eleven patients received monthly injection of Sandostatin LAR and eight patients underwent transsphenoidal surgery. Serum concentrations of leptin, GH, IGF-1 and insulin were measured before and after treatment. Serum leptin concentrations were lower in patients with active acromegaly than controls matched for age, sex and body mass index (BMI) [2.79 microg/l (2.60) vs. 4.41 microg/l (5.07); median (inter-quartile range); P &lt; 0.01]. A positive correlation between serum leptin concentrations and BMI was observed in the controls (r = 0.46, P &lt; 0.05) but not in the acromegalic patients before treatment (r = 0.32, ns). In the group of patients treated with Sandostatin LAR, a marked reduction in GH and IGF-1 was achieved by week 8 and GH and IGF-1 remained suppressed throughout the 6 months of treatment. There was no change in BMI. A significant increase in leptin levels only became evident after 6 months of treatment [2.99 microg/l (2.60) vs. 4.21 microg/l (3.84), P &lt; 0.05]. Leptin levels also significantly increased after transsphenoidal surgery [3.05 microg/l (5.73) vs. 5.19 microg/l (4.93), P &lt; 0.05]. The positive correlation between serum leptin concentrations and BMI was restored in acromegalic patients both after treatment with Sandostatin LAR (r = 0.62, P &lt; 0.05) and after surgery (r = 0.81, P &lt; 0.05). Leptin concentrations were decreased in patients with active acromegaly and lowering GH by either Sandostatin LAR or transsphenoidal surgery led to an increase in leptin concentrations.",

    "title": "Transcriptional regulation of the thyrotropin-releasing hormone gene by leptin and melanocortin signaling.",
    "abstract": "Starvation causes a rapid reduction in thyroid hormone levels in rodents. This adaptive response is caused by a reduction in thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) expression that can be reversed by the administration of leptin. Here we examined hypothalamic signaling pathways engaged by leptin to upregulate TRH gene expression. As assessed by leptin-induced expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3) in fasted rats, TRH neurons in the paraventricular nucleus are activated directly by leptin. To a greater degree, they also contain melanocortin-4 receptors (MC4Rs), implying that leptin can act directly or indirectly by increasing the production of the MC4R ligand, alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), to regulate TRH expression. We further demonstrate that both pathways converge on the TRH promoter. The melanocortin system activates the TRH promoter through the phosphorylation and DNA binding of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), and leptin signaling directly regulates the TRH promoter through the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3). Indeed, a novel Stat-response element in the TRH promoter is necessary for leptin's effect. Thus, the TRH promoter is an ideal target for further characterizing the integration of transcriptional pathways through which leptin acts.",

    "title": "Leptin as a modulator of sweet taste sensitivities in mice.",
    "abstract": "Leptin acts as a potent inhibitory factor against obesity by regulating energy expenditure, food intake, and adiposity. The obese diabetic db/db mouse, which has defects in leptin receptor, displays enhanced neural responses and elevated behavioral preference to sweet stimuli. Here, we show the effects of leptin on the peripheral taste system. An administration of leptin into lean mice suppressed responses of peripheral taste nerves (chorda tympani and glossopharyngeal) to sweet substances (sucrose and saccharin) without affecting responses to sour, salty, and bitter substances. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of activities of taste receptor cells isolated from circumvallate papillae (innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve) demonstrated that leptin activated outward K(+) currents, which resulted in hyperpolarization of taste cells. The db/db mouse with impaired leptin receptors showed no such leptin suppression. Taste tissue (circumvallate papilla) of lean mice expressed leptin-receptor mRNA and some of the taste cells exhibited immunoreactivities to antibodies of the leptin receptor. Taken together, these observations suggest that the taste organ is a peripheral target for leptin, and that leptin may be a sweet-sensing modulator (suppressor) that may take part in regulation of food intake. Defects in this leptin suppression system in db/db mice may lead to their enhanced peripheral neural responses and enhanced behavioral preferences for sweet substances.",

    "abstract": "The pathophysiology of obesity is complex with many different pathways involved. A better understanding of these weight-regulating mechanisms has lead to the identification of new targets for anti-obesity agents. Most attention has been given to the centrally acting neuropeptides regulating food intake. Leptin, playing a key-role, exerts its action through several neuropeptides such as neuropeptide Y, alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone and agouti related protein. Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide and the orexins are the latest discovered peptides acting at the level of the hypothalamus. Targets for new drugs acting on peptides secreted from the periphery are cholecystokinin and glucagon-like peptide 1. Another potential target in the treatment of obesity is increasing energy expenditure via beta3 adrenoceptors or uncoupling proteins. These new pharmacological agents in development could be valuable adjuncts to more traditional treatment strategies such as dietary treatment, behavioural/psychological counselling and physical activity.",

We have identified a link between anabolic energy metabolism and appetite control. Both systemic and intracerebroventricular treatment of mice with fatty acid synthase (FAS) inhibitors (cerulenin and a synthetic compound C75) led to inhibition of feeding and dramatic weight loss. C75 inhibited expression of the prophagic signal neuropeptide Y in the hypothalamus and acted in a leptin-independent manner that appears to be mediated by malonyl-coenzyme A. Thus, FAS may represent an important link in feeding regulation and may be a potential therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Galanin-like peptide (GALP), which was recently isolated from the porcine hypothalamus, shares sequence homology with galanin and binds with high affinity to galanin receptors. To study the distribution and regulation of GALP-expressing cells in the brain, we cloned a 120 base-pair cDNA fragment of rat GALP and produced an antisense riboprobe. In situ hybridization for GALP mRNA was then performed on tissue sections throughout the forebrain of adult ovariectomized female rats. We found GALP mRNA-containing cells in the arcuate nucleus (Arc), caudal dorsomedial nucleus, median eminence and the pituitary. Because GALP mRNA in the Arc appeared to overlap with the known distribution of leptin receptor mRNA, we tested the hypothesis that GALP expression is regulated by leptin. Using in situ hybridization, we compared the number of GALP mRNA-containing cells among groups of rats that were fed ad lib or fasted for 48 h and treated with either leptin or vehicle. Fasting reduced the number of identifiable cells containing GALP mRNA in the Arc, whereas the treatment of fasted animals with leptin produced a 4-fold increase in the number of cells expressing GALP message. The presence of GALP mRNA in the hypothalamus and pituitary and its regulation by leptin suggests that GALP may have important neuroendocrine functions, including the physiological regulation of feeding, metabolism, and reproduction.",

However, the identities of the biologically relevant target genes are largely unknown. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of a novel target gene induced by PPARgamma ligands, termed PGAR (for PPARgamma angiopoietin related), which encodes a novel member of the angiopoietin family of secreted proteins. The transcriptional induction of PGAR follows a rapid time course typical of immediate-early genes and occurs in the absence of protein synthesis. The expression of PGAR is predominantly localized to adipose tissues and placenta and is consistently elevated in genetic models of obesity. Hormone-dependent adipocyte differentiation coincides with a dramatic early induction of the PGAR transcript. Alterations in nutrition and leptin administration are found to modulate the PGAR expression in vivo. Taken together, these data suggest a possible role for PGAR in the regulation of systemic lipid metabolism or glucose homeostasis.",

    "title": "Pharmacology of appetite suppression.",
    "abstract": "Despite a rising worldwide epidemic of obesity there is currently only a very small number of anti-obesity drugs available to manage the problem. Large numbers of differing pharmacological agents reliably produce a reduction in food intake when administered acutely to animals, and when administered chronically they result in a significant decrease in body mass. Behavioural analysis of drug-induced anorexia in animals demonstrates that various compounds profoundly effect feeding behaviour in differing ways. This indicates the variety of mechanisms by which pharmacological agents can induce changes in food intake, body weight and eventually body composition. Some of the same drugs produce decreases in food intake and weight loss in humans. Some of these drugs do so by modifying the functioning of the appetite system as measured by subjective changes in feelings of hunger and fullness (indices of satiety). Such drugs can be considered as appetite suppressants with clinical potential as anti-obesity agents. Other drugs induce changes in food intake and body weight through various physiological mechanisms inducing feelings of nausea or even by side effect related malaise. Of the drugs considered suitable candidates for appetite suppressants are agents which act via peripherally satiety peptide systems (such as CCK, Bombesin/GRP, Enterostatin and GLP-1), or alter the CNS levels of various hypothalamic neuropeptides (NPY, Galanin, Orexin and Melanocortins) or levels of the key CNS appetite monoamine neurotransmitters such as serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA). Recently, the hormone leptin has been regarded as a hormonal signal linking adipose tissue status with a number of key central nervous system circuits. The peptide itself stimulates leptin receptors and it links with POMC and MC-4 receptors. These receptors may also provide drug targets for the control of appetite. Any changes induced by a potential appetite suppressant should be considered in terms of the (i) psychological experience and behavioural expression of appetite, (ii) metabolism and peripheral physiology, and (iii) functioning of CNS neural pathways. In humans, modulation of appetite may involve changes in total caloric consumption, subjective changes in feelings of hunger and fullness, preferences for specific food items, and general macronutrient preferences. These may be expressed behaviourally as changes in meal patterns, snacking behaviour and food choice. Within the next 20 years it is certain that clinicians will have a new range of anti-obesity compounds available to choose from. Such novel compounds may act on a single component of the appetite system or target a combination of these components detailed in this review. Such compounds used in combination with lifestyle changes and dietary intervention may be useful in dealing with the rising world epidemic of obesity.",

    "title": "Identification and expression analysis of leptin-regulated immediate early response and late target genes.",
    "abstract": "Using PC12 cells as an in vitro model system, we have identified a series of transcripts induced through activation of the leptin receptor. On the basis of kinetic studies, two distinct gene sets could be discerned: signal transducer and activator of transciption-3 (STAT-3), suppressor of cytokine signalling-3 (SOCS-3), MT-II (metallothionein-II), the serine/threonine kinase fibroblast-growth-factor-inducible kinase (Fnk) and modulator recognition factor (MRF-1), which are immediate early response genes, and pancreatitis-associated protein I (PAP I), squalene epoxidase, uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase and annexin VIII, which are late induced target genes. At late time points a strong co-stimulation with beta-nerve growth factor or with the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin was observed. To assess the validity of the PC12-cell model system, we examined the effect of leptin administration on the gene transcription of STAT-3, MT-II, Fnk and PAP I in vivo. Leptin treatment of leptin-deficient ob/ob mice increased the STAT-3, SOCS-3, MT-II and Fnk mRNA, and MT-I protein levels in liver, whereas, in jejunum, expression of PAP I mRNA was down-regulated. Furthermore, administration of leptin to starved wild-type mice enhanced the expression of MT-II and Fnk mRNA in liver, but decreased MT-II and PAP I mRNA expression in jejunum. These findings may help to explain the obese phenotype observed in some colonies of MT-I- and MT-II-null mice and/or the observation that leptin protects against tumour-necrosis-factor toxicity in vivo.",

    "abstract": "New information regarding neuronal circuits that control food intake and their hormonal regulation has extended our understanding of energy homeostasis, the process whereby energy intake is matched to energy expenditure over time. The profound obesity that results in rodents (and in the rare human case as well) from mutation of key signalling molecules involved in this regulatory system highlights its importance to human health. Although each new signalling pathway discovered in the hypothalamus is a potential target for drug development in the treatment of obesity, the growing number of such signalling molecules indicates that food intake is controlled by a highly complex process. To better understand how energy homeostasis can be achieved, we describe a model that delineates the roles of individual hormonal and neuropeptide signalling pathways in the control of food intake and the means by which obesity can arise from inherited or acquired defects in their function.",

    "abstract": "Absence of the hormone leptin leads to dramatic increases in appetite, food intake, and adiposity. The primary site of action, at least with respect to appetite, is the hypothalamus. Leptin also has significant effects on the function(s) of peripheral organs involved in maintaining body composition. Some of these effects are mediated through direct interaction of leptin with its receptor on the target tissue, and some effects are indirectly mediated through secondary hormonal and neural pathways. Few of the genes that are responsible for regulating body composition and the peripheral effects of leptin are known. We have used a new gene profiling technology to characterize gene expression changes that occur in the pituitary, hypothalamus, fat, muscle, and liver in response to both obesity and treatment with exogenous leptin. These differences were then overlaid to allow the identification of genes that are regulated by obesity and at least partially normalized by leptin treatment. By using this process we have identified five genes (POMC, PC2, prolactin, HSGP25L2G, and one novel) that are both abnormally expressed in the pituitaries of obese mice and are sensitive to the effects of leptin. We also show that adrenocorticotropic hormone appears to be involved in a regulatory loop involving leptin.",

    "title": "Effects of testosterone suppression in young men by the gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonist cetrorelix on plasma lipids, lipolytic enzymes, lipid transfer proteins, insulin, and leptin.",
    "abstract": "We investigated in a pilot study the effect of testosterone suppression on lipoprotein metabolism, insulin, and leptin in 10 men who were treated either with cetrorelix, an antagonist of gonadotropin releasing hormone, or with placebo (P). Group C + C (n = 4) was treated with 10 mg cetrorelix as daily subcutaneous injections for five days and with a subsequent injection of 60 mg cetrorelix depot. Group C + P (n = 3) received 10 mg cetrorelix as daily intramuscular injections for five days and a subsequent injection of placebo depot. Group P + P (n = 3) received placebo both as daily and depot injections. Treatment with cetrorelix reversibly suppressed testosterone to castrate levels for three weeks in group C + C and for one week in group C + P. Compared to baseline, treatment with cetrorelix increased serum levels of apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, HDL subclass LpA-I, insulin, and leptin. In the group P + P, treatment with placebo was not associated with any change of these parameters. Compared to baseline and group P + P, treatment with cetrorelix in groups C + C and C + P did not lead to considerable or consistent changes in the plasma activities of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP), cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), lipoprotein lipase, and hepatic lipase (HL). Only the pooled data of groups C + C and C + P unraveled small but statistically significant decreases of HL and CETP activities in response to cetrorelix. In conclusion, the small or absent effects of cetrorelix on LCAT, CETP, PLTP, LPL, and HL indicate that testosterone regulates HDL levels by other metabolic pathways. The increases of insulin and leptin in response to cetrorelix suggest that testosterone influences HDL metabolism also via obesity and insulin resistance. These effects, however, are rather in contrast to the HDL raising effect of suppressed testosterone.",

    "title": "Involvement of the histaminergic system in leptin-induced suppression of food intake.",
    "abstract": "The ob gene product leptin is secreted from white adipose tissue, and may regulate food intake by acting on the hypothalamus in the central nervous system. But the mechanism of this effect is still unclear. The central histaminergic system has been suggested to participate in the control of various physiological functions, particularly in feeding behavior, as it mediates anorectic signals like leptin. Thus, we hypothesized that the central histaminergic system is a target for leptin in its control of feeding. To prove this, we first examined the effect of i.p. administration of alpha-fluoromethylhistidine (FMH), a specific and irreversible inhibitor of histidine decarboxylase, on leptin-induced suppression of food intake in normal C57BL strain mice. Leptin treatment (1.3 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reduced food intake by 60% of that of control at 6 h and by 84% at 24 h compared with control. When mice were injected with FMH (100 mg/kg, i.p.) before being given leptin, leptin-induced suppression of food intake was abolished and there was no significant difference compared with that of control. Additionally, we further examined the effects of leptin on food intake in mutant mice lacking histamine H, receptors (H1R-KO mice). Leptin injection significantly reduced food intake by 56% of that of control at 6 h and by 79% at 24 h in wild-type mice (WT mice), but not in H1R-KO mice. This finding suggests that leptin affects the feeding behavior through activation of the central histaminergic system via histamine H1 receptors.",

    "title": "Hypothalamic neuronal histamine as a target of leptin in feeding behavior.",
    "abstract": "Leptin, an ob gene product, has been shown to suppress food intake by regulating hypothalamic neuromodulators. The present study was designed to examine the involvement of brain histamine in leptin-induced feeding suppression. A bolus infusion of 1.0 microg leptin into the rat third cerebroventricle (i3vt) elevated the turnover rate of hypothalamic neuronal histamine (P &lt; 0.05) as assessed by pargyline-induced accumulation of tele-methylhistamine (t-MH), a major metabolite of histamine. No remarkable change in the mRNA expression of histidine decarboxylase (HDC), a histamine-synthesizing enzyme, was observed in the hypothalamus after i3vt infusion of leptin. These results indicate that leptin increases histamine turnover by affecting the posttranscriptional process of HDC formation or histamine release per se. As expected, concomitant suppression in 24-h cumulative food intake was also observed after infusion of leptin. Systemic depletion of brain histamine levels by pretreatment with an intraperitoneal injection of 224 micromol/kg alpha-fluoromethylhistidine (FMH), a suicide inhibitor of HDC, attenuated the leptin-induced feeding suppression by 50.7% (P &lt; 0.05). This attenuation of feeding suppression was mimicked by the i3vt infusion of 2.24 micromol/kg FMH before leptin treatment (P &lt; 0.05). In addition, concentrations of hypothalamic histamine and t-MH were lowered in diabetic (db/db) mice, which are known to be deficient in leptin receptors (P &lt; 0.05 vs. lean littermates for each amine), although the amine levels were higher in diet-induced obese rats (P &lt; 0.05 for each amine). Leptin-deficient obese mice (ob/ob) showed lower histamine turnover (P &lt; 0.05 vs. lean littermates), which recovered after leptin infusion. Thus, a growing body of results points to an important role for the hypothalamic histamine neurons in the central regulation of feeding behavior controlled by leptin.",

    "title": "Distinct physiologic and neuronal responses to decreased leptin and mild hyperleptinemia.",
    "abstract": "Leptin acts on specific populations of hypothalamic neurons to regulate feeding behavior, energy expenditure, and neuroendocrine function. It is not known, however, whether the same neural circuits mediate leptin action across its full biologic dose-response curve, which extends over a broad range, from low levels seen during starvation to high levels characteristic of obesity. Here, we show that the characteristic fall in leptin with fasting causes a rise in neuropeptide Y (NPY) messenger RNA (mRNA), as well as a fall in POMC and cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) mRNAs. Sc infusion of leptin sufficient to maintain plasma levels within the physiologic range during the fast prevents changes in the expression of these peptides, as well as changes in neuroendocrine function, demonstrating that multiple neural circuits are highly sensitive to small changes in leptin within its low physiologic range. In contrast, a modest elevation of plasma leptin above the normal fed range by constant sc infusion, which produced marked reduction in food intake and body weight, decreased NPY mRNA in the arcuate hypothalamic nucleus but did not affect the levels of mRNAs encoding the anorexigenic peptides alpha-MSH, CART or CRH. These results suggest that the dose response characteristics of leptin on hypothalamic target neurons at the level of mRNA expression are variable, with some neurons (e.g. NPY) responding across a broad dose range and others (e.g. POMC and CART) showing a limited response within the low range. These results further suggest that the central targets of leptin that mediate the transition from starvation to the fed state may be distinct from those that mediate the response to overfeeding and obesity.",

    "title": "Leptin sensitive neurons in the hypothalamus.",
    "abstract": "A major paradigm in the field of obesity research is the existence of an adipose tissue-brain endocrine axis for the regulation of body weight. Leptin, the peptide mediator of this axis, is secreted by adipose cells. It lowers food intake and body weight by acting in the hypothalamus, a region expressing an abundance of leptin receptors and a variety of neuropeptides that influence food intake and energy balance. Among the most promising candidates for leptin-sensitive cells in the hypothalamus are arcuate nucleus neurons that co-express the anabolic neuropeptides, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AGRP), and those that express proopiomelanocortin (POMC), the precursor of the catabolic peptide, alphaMSH. These cell types contain mRNA encoding leptin receptors and show changes in neuropeptide gene expression in response to changes in food intake and circulating leptin levels. Decreased leptin signaling in the arcuate nucleus is hypothesized to increase the expression of NPY and AGRP. Levels of leptin receptor mRNA and leptin binding are increased in the arcuate nucleus during fasting, principally in NPY/AGRP neurons. These findings suggest that changes in leptin receptor expression in the arcuate nucleus are inversely associated with changes in leptin signaling, and that the arcuate nucleus is an important target of leptin action in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript peptide (CART), is a recently discovered hypothalamic peptide with a potent appetite suppressing activity. In the rat the CART gene encodes a peptide of either 129 or 116 amino acid residues whereas only the short form exists in humans. The predicted signal sequence is 27 amino acid residues resulting in a prohormone of 102 or 89 residues. The C-terminal end of CART, consisting of 48 amino acid residues and 3 disulphide bonds, is thought to constitute a biologically active part of the molecule. In the central nervous system CART is highly expressed in many hypothalamic nuclei, some of which are involved in regulating feeding behaviour. The CART mRNA is regulated by leptin, and the expressed CART is a potent inhibitor of feeding that even overrides the feeding response induced by neuropeptide Y. The putative CART receptor is therefore a potential therapeutic target for an anti-obesity drug.",

    "abstract": "Mutations reducing the functional activity of leptin, the leptin receptor, alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormones (alpha-MSH) and the melanocortin-4 receptor (Mc4r) all lead to obesity in mammals. Moreover, mutant mice that ectopically express either agouti (Ay/a mice) or agouti-related protein (Agrp), antagonists of melanocortin signalling, become obese. These data suggest that alpha-MSH signalling transduced by Mc4r tonically inhibits feeding; however, it is not known to what extent this pathway mediates leptin signalling. We show here that Mc4r-deficient (Mc4r-/-) mice do not respond to the anorectic actions of MTII, an MSH-like agonist, suggesting that alpha-MSH inhibits feeding primarily by activating Mc4r. Obese Mc4r-/-mice do not respond significantly to the inhibitory effects of leptin on feeding, whereas non-obese Mc4r-/- mice do. These data demonstrate that melanocortin signalling transduced by Mc4r is not an exclusive target of leptin action and that factors resulting from obesity contribute to leptin resistance. Leptin resistance of obese Mc4r-/- mice does not prevent their response to the anorectic actions of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), or urocortin; or the orexigenic actions of neuropeptide Y (NPY) or peptide YY (PYY), indicating that these neuromodulators act independently or downstream of Mc4r signalling.",

    "title": "Does leptin regulate insulin secretion?",
    "abstract": "The hormone leptin secreted by adipocytes plays a major role in body weight homeostasis. Its main target is the hypothalamus, but it also affects several peripheral tissues directly. The direct effect of leptin on insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells has been investigated in several studies, though with controversial results. Interpretation of these data must take into account the animal model and the leptin concentrations used. Experiments carried out on islets from ob/ob mice harbouring a mutation in the leptin gene are not representative of the leptin effect in normal animals because ob/ob islets are very sensitive to the hormone and show altered regulation of insulin secretion. In normal rodent islets, physiological concentrations of leptin seem to inhibit insulin secretion only when the islets are maximally stimulated with high concentrations of glucose associated with secretion potentiators. Several isoforms of the leptin receptor are expressed in pancreatic beta cells. Indirect experimental evidence suggests that leptin signalling in islets requires the long isoform of the receptor. The molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of leptin on insulin secretion are unknown. Our hypothesis is that physiological concentrations of leptin in normal rodents do not affect the direct pathway (coupling a rise in glucose concentration to insulin secretion) but modulate a potentiation of glucose-induced insulin secretion involving cyclic AMP or phospholipase C/protein kinase C activation.",

    "title": "Leptin action in intestinal cells.",
    "abstract": "The adipocyte hormone leptin activates signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in the hypothalamus, mediating increased satiety and increased energy expenditure. To date, leptin-mediated activation of the STAT pathway in vivo has not been established in tissues other than hypothalamus. We now describe leptin receptor expression and in vivo signaling in discrete regions of the mouse gastrointestinal tract. Expression of the functional isoform leptin receptor (OB-Rb) is restricted to the jejunum and is readily detected by RT-PCR in isolated enterocytes from this site. Intravenous injection of leptin rapidly induced nuclear STAT5 DNA binding activity in jejunum of +/+ and obese (ob/ob) mice but had no effect in the diabetic (db/db) mouse that lacks the OB-Rb isoform. In addition, an induction of the immediate-early gene c-fos is observed in jejunum in vivo. Leptin-mediated induction of a number of immediate-early genes and activation of STAT3 and STAT5 in a human model of small intestine epithelium, CACO-2 cells, corroborate this effect. Furthermore, intravenous leptin administration caused a significant 2-fold reduction in the apolipoprotein AIV transcript levels in jejunum 90 min after a fat load. Our results suggest that the epithelium of jejunum is a direct target of leptin action, and this activity is dependent on the presence of OB-Rb. Lack of leptin or resistance to leptin action in this site may contribute to obesity and its related syndromes by directly affecting lipid handling.",

    "title": "Chronic ethanol consumption induces the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and related cytokines in liver and adipose tissue.",
    "abstract": "Increases in monocyte/macrophage production of the proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), parallel the evolution of liver injury in rats and humans with alcoholic liver disease. However, the possibility that TNF-alpha expression may be induced in other cell populations before serious liver disease develops has not been evaluated. To clarify this issue, mRNAs and/or protein levels of TNF-alpha and cytokines [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF)-beta, IL-12, and interferon-gamma] that regulate its biological activity were measured in sera, liver, and adipose tissues of rats that had developed hepatic steatosis after consuming ethanol-containing diets for 6 weeks. Cytokine expression in the ethanol-fed groups was compared with that of pair-fed controls rats that had received isocaloric amounts of a similar, ethanol-free diet for the same time period. Animals were studied both before and after a surgical stress (partial hepatectomy) that is known to provoke cytokine production. Chronic ethanol consumption led to increased serum concentrations of TNF and related cytokines, at least in part, by inducing the overproduction of these factors in the liver and peripheral adipose tissues. Despite the pair-feeding protocol that ensured similar calorie consumption in both groups, adipose tissues in ethanol-fed rats also expressed more leptin, a TNF-alpha-inducible mRNA that encodes an appetite-suppressing hormone. Thus, white adipose tissue can be an important source of cytokines in nonobese animals and may be a target for ethanol's actions. These data implicate TNF-alpha as a potential mediator of the nutritional-metabolic aberrations that often accompany chronic alcohol intake, even in the absence of advanced liver disease.",

Eight lean, healthy human volunteers, (4M:4F; median (interquartile range) age 36.5 (30.8-40.0) years; BMI 22.9 (20.1-29.2) kg.m-2; % body fat 24.5 (17.9-26.3)), were studied following an overnight fast. Intravenous infusion of isoprenaline was carried out for 3 h, followed by a 1 hour recovery phase.

Plasma leptin was determined using an in-house radioimmunoassay, nonesterified fatty acids estimated with an enzymatic colourimetric assay and insulin concentrations were assayed using a specific, two-site immunoenzymometric assay. Fasting preinfusion plasma leptin concentrations (6.3 (3.0-12.8) micrograms/l) correlated with percentage body fat measured by bioimpedance (r = 0.95; P &lt; 0.001). Plasma leptin concentrations were rapidly suppressed by isoprenaline, with maximal suppression (20.5 (15.0-25.0)% of preinfusion levels (Wilcoxon rank sum test; P &lt; 0.05)), observed after 2 h. In the recovery period, plasma leptin concentrations rapidly returned to preinfusion levels (postinfusion vs maximally suppressed leptin concentrations P &lt; 0.05; vs preinfusion leptin concentrations P = NS). Plasma nonesterified fatty acids and insulin concentrations showed opposite changes to those observed with leptin.

No effects of leptin were found on the rates of 3H-2-deoxy-glucose transport (basal: control, 314+/-14; 1 nmol/l leptin, 320+/-17; 10 nmol/l leptin, 314+/-13; 100 nmol/l leptin, 322+/-16; insulin-stimulated: control, 690+/-33; 1 nmol/l leptin, 691+/-29; 10 nmol/l leptin, 665+/-26; 100 nmol/l leptin, 664+/-27; cpm x mg(-1) x h(-1); NS vs respective control) and on net glucose incorporation into glycogen (basal: control, 1.75+/-0.18; 1 nmol/l leptin, 2.01+/-0.13; 10 nmol/l leptin, 1.92+/-0.11; 100 nmol/l leptin, 1.81+/-0.13; insulin-stimulated: control, 5.98+/-0.40; 1 nmol/l leptin, 5.93+/-0.30; 10 nmol/l leptin, 5.46+/-0.25; 100 nmol/l leptin, 5.85+/-0.30; micromol x g(-1) x h(-1); NS vs respective control). In parallel, leptin failed to affect rates of aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis as well as muscle glycogen content. Further experiments revealed that the inability of leptin to directly affect muscle glucose handling prevailed independently of muscle fiber type (soleus and epitrochlearis muscle), of ambient insulin concentrations (0-30 nmol/l), and of leptin exposure time (1 h or 6 h). Thus, our findings fail to support speculations about a physiological role of direct insulin-mimetic or insulin-desensitizing effects of leptin on skeletal muscle tissue.",

    "title": "Plasma leptin in diabetic and insulin-treated diabetic and normal rats.",
    "abstract": "Adipose tissue leptin mRNA levels are decreased by food deprivation or induction of insulin-deficient diabetes. To determine whether plasma leptin concentrations are similarly affected, whether treatment of diabetes with insulin restores plasma leptin, and whether this requires restoration of body weight (lost as a result of diabetes) and/or normalization of glycemia, we measured plasma leptin concentrations in control, untreated streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic, and insulin-treated STZ-diabetic rats. Plasma leptin was markedly reduced in untreated STZ-diabetic rats. Insulin treatment for 4 to 17 days increased plasma leptin approximately twofold above control levels. However, despite the hyperleptinemia, insulin-treated diabetic rats gained weight at a rate equal to that of sham-treated controls. Epididymal adipose tissue leptin mRNA levels in 17-day insulin-treated diabetic rats were equal to but did not exceed sham-control levels, unlike plasma leptin. Plasma glucose concentrations in insulin-treated STZ-diabetic rats were lower than in sham controls. Therefore, to determine whether hypoglycemia may be important in increasing plasma leptin, we measured plasma leptin levels in diabetic rats infused with insulin for 3 hours along with a variable-rate glucose infusion targeting glycemia to 200 or 40 mg/100 mL. Plasma leptin rapidly increased in these rats irrespective of target glycemia. Plasma leptin also increased rapidly in normal rats infused with insulin and glucose (target glycemia, 200 mg/100 mL). We conclude that plasma leptin concentrations are markedly reduced under conditions of insulin deficiency and rapidly increased by insulin treatment. The increase in plasma leptin does not require restoration of body weight and, under glucose clamp conditions, does not depend on target glycemia. Hyperleptinemia in insulin-treated diabetic rats is not explained on the basis of steady-state leptin mRNA levels, at least as reflected in epididymal fat.",

    "title": "Direct effects of leptin on brown and white adipose tissue.",
    "abstract": "Leptin is thought to exert its actions on energy homeostasis through the long form of the leptin receptor (OB-Rb), which is present in the hypothalamus and in certain peripheral organs, including adipose tissue. In this study, we examined whether leptin has direct effects on the function of brown and white adipose tissue (BAT and WAT, respectively) at the metabolic and molecular levels. The chronic peripheral intravenous administration of leptin in vivo for 4 d resulted in a 1.6-fold increase in the in vivo glucose utilization index of BAT, whereas no significant change was found after intracerebroventricular administration compared with pair-fed control rats, compatible with a direct effect of leptin on BAT. The effect of leptin on WAT fat pads from lean Zucker Fa/ fa rats was assessed ex vivo, where a 9- and 16-fold increase in the rate of lipolysis was observed after 2 h of exposure to 0.1 and 10 nM leptin, respectively. In contrast, no increase in lipolysis was observed in the fat pads from obese fa/fa rats, which harbor an inactivating mutation in the OB-Rb. At the level of gene expression, leptin treatment for 24 h increased malic enzyme and lipoprotein lipase RNA 1.8+/-0.17 and 1.9+/-0.14-fold, respectively, while aP2 mRNA levels were unaltered in primary cultures of brown adipocytes from lean Fa/fa rats. Importantly, however, no significant effect of leptin was observed on these genes in brown adipocytes from obese fa/fa animals. The presence of OB-Rb receptors in adipose tissue was substantiated by the detection of its transcripts by RT-PCR, and leptin treatment in vivo and in vitro activated the specific STATs implicated in the signaling pathway of the OB-Rb. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that leptin has direct effects on BAT and WAT, resulting in the activation of the Jak/STAT pathway and the increased expression of certain target genes, which may partially account for the observed increase in glucose utilization and lipolysis in leptin-treated adipose tissue.",

    "abstract": "Leptin is a hormone produced and secreted from the adipose tissue. Its physiological actions include the regulation of satiety, food intake and energy balance. The production of leptin is increased by high insulin levels. Here, we demonstrate that leptin acts as an inhibitor of glucose-induced (20 mM) insulin secretion from isolated human islets. No effect was observed in the presence of lower glucose levels (2.8 and 10 mM glucose). The pancreatic beta-cell might represent a target of a direct physiological action of leptin. We suggest the presence of an adipo-insular axis in which leptin mediates negative feedback from the adipose tissue to the endocrine pancreas.",

    "title": "Evidence against a direct effect of leptin on glucose transport in skeletal muscle and adipocytes.",
    "abstract": "Recently, it has been proposed that leptin, the ob gene product, influences some steps in the insulin-signaling cascade. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether leptin exerts direct effects on glucose transport in insulin target tissues. Epitrochlearis muscles or isolated adipocytes from male SD rats were incubated in the absence or presence of recombinant leptin (3-1,000 ng/ml), and in the absence or presence of submaximal or maximal insulin concentrations. In skeletal muscle, insulin increased 3-O-methylglucose transport (1.88 +/- 0.21, 4.06 +/- 0.59, and 9.35 +/- 1.90 micromol x ml-1 x h-1, for 0, 0.6, and 12.0 nmol/l insulin, respectively). Leptin exposure (300 ng/ml) for 2 h did not alter the basal, submaximal, or maximal response of glucose transport to insulin in skeletal muscle (1.50 +/- 0.14, 4.76 +/- 0.58, and 9.04 +/- 1.09 micromol x ml-1 x h-1 for 0, 0.6, and 12.0 nmol/l insulin, respectively). Insulin increased glucose transport in rat adipocytes (0.194 +/- 0.007, 1.059 +/- 0.029, and 3.367 +/- 0.143 pmol [14C]glucose x 0.5 ml-1 cell suspension x min-1 for 0, 0.8, and 80 nmol/l insulin, respectively); in vitro exposure to leptin (300 ng/ml) did not alter glucose transport (0.220 +/- 0.006, 1.269 +/- 0.046, and 3.221 +/- 0.285 pmol [14C]glucose x 0.5 ml-1 cell suspension x min-1 for 0, 0.8, and 80 nmol/l insulin, respectively). Similar to our findings in the epitrochlearis muscle, leptin had no direct effect on basal or insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in soleus muscle from ob/ob or lean mice or adipocytes from normal mice. In summary, in vitro exposure of skeletal muscle or adipocytes to recombinant leptin did not alter glucose transport in the absence of insulin, nor did it affect the sensitivity or responsiveness of the glucose transport system to insulin.",

Using dual in situ hybridization, long isoform leptin receptor (OB-Rb) was localized to GLP-1 neurons originating in the nucleus of the solitary tract. ICV injection of the specific GLP-1 receptor antagonist, exendin(9-39), at the onset of dark phase, did not affect feeding in saline pre-treated controls, but blocked the reduction in food intake and body weight of leptin pre-treated rats. These findings suggest that GLP-1 neurons are a potential target for leptin in its control of feeding.",

    "title": "Regulation of hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin mRNA by leptin in ob/ob mice.",
    "abstract": "The hormone leptin acts on the brain to regulate feeding, metabolism, and reproduction; however, its cellular targets and molecular mechanisms of action remain to be fully elucidated. The melanocortins, which are derived from the precursor proopiomelanocortin (POMC), are also implicated in the physiological regulation of body weight. POMC-containing neurons express the leptin receptor, and thus it is conceivable that the POMC gene itself may be part of the signaling pathway involved in leptin's action on the brain. Using in situ hybridization and computerized image analysis, we tested the hypothesis that the POMC gene is a target for regulation by leptin by comparing cellular levels of POMC mRNA in the hypothalamus among groups of leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice, leptin-treated ob/ob mice, and wild-type controls. POMC mRNA levels were significantly reduced throughout the arcuate nucleus in vehicle-treated ob/ob mice relative to wild-type controls, whereas POMC mRNA levels in leptin-treated ob/ob mice were indistinguishable from wild-type controls. These observations suggest that one or more products of POMC serve as an integrative link between leptin and the central mechanisms governing body weight regulation and reproduction.",

    "title": "Short-term treatment with oleoyl-oestrone in liposomes (Merlin-2) strongly reduces the expression of the ob gene in young rats.",
    "abstract": "Young female rats of 160-180 g were implanted with osmotic minipumps releasing 3.0 micromol/day per kg of oleoyl-oestrone in liposomes (Merlin-2) into the bloodstream for up to 14 days. Merlin-2 induced a loss of appetite in the first days, later recovered, and a decrease in body weight of 7%, which contrasts with the 15% increase in controls during the 2-week period. Neither plasma glucose nor urea was affected by treatment, but liver glycogen increased by 50% in 14 days. Insulin decreased slightly with Merlin-2 treatment. Plasma corticotropin (ACTH) and corticosterone showed a transient increase by day 6 of treatment. The expression of the ob gene in adipose tissue fell during the period studied to practically nil on day 14; circulating leptin levels decreased more than 70% from day 1 to day 14. Oestrone levels increased from 0.3 nM (controls) to a maintained 40-60 nM level for the rest of the experiment. Oleoyl-oestrone levels first increased 4-fold, to decrease again to the initial levels on day 10, increasing later to 100-fold on day 14. The three phases observed in food intake, weight loss and oleoyl-oestrone levels match fairly well, which supports the direct involvement of oleoyl-oestrone in body-weight control. However, the control of oleoyl-oestrone levels seems to be mediated in part by corticosterone. The practical disappearance of leptin synthesis coincides with the massive accumulation of oleoyl-oestrone in plasma. The results presented suggest the involvement of oleoyl-oestrone in the main mechanisms of control of body weight and its regulation by glucocorticoids and leptin.",

    "abstract": "In vitro gastric vagal afferents' (GVAs) unit activities were recorded from the ventral GVA nerve strands in rats. The responsiveness of 16 GVA terminals to close intra-arterial injection of vehicle (0.1 ml), leptin (350 pmol), and cholecystokinin (CCK)-8 (10 pmol) was analyzed to generate a spike count-versus-time histogram. Data of 5-min spike counts before and after each treatment were normalized by dividing the latter by the former. A quotient (Q) &gt; 1 indicates an excitatory effect, Q &lt; 1 indicates an inhibitory effect, and Q close to 1 indicates no effect. Two types of GVA terminals were identified. Type 1 (n = 8) responded to leptin with Q &gt; 1; CCK-8 pretreatment did not consistently alter leptin sensitivity. In contrast, Type 2 (n = 8) responded to leptin with Q &lt; 1 or close to 1, and CCK-8 pretreatment increased the leptin sensitivity so that the terminals responded to subsequent leptin with Q &gt; 1. These data suggest that Type 1 and Type 2 GVA terminals may provide afferent neural signals, which, in turn, will be involved in body weight and food intake control systems, respectively.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether changes in food intake produced by leptin involve targeting the hormone to distinct central nervous system regions, guide cannulas were positioned stereotaxically into three brain regions--the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) (bilaterally, n = 6), the dorsal raphe nucleus (n = 3), and the lateral ventricle (n = 3)--of nonobese male rats (400-500 g). Daily food intake and body weight changes were measured during twice-daily injections of saline (0.1 microl) followed by recombinant human leptin (0.05 microg) for 3 days via the brain cannulas. VMH-injected rats also were followed during a postleptin saline recovery interval. This small dose of leptin did not change food intake or body weight from that during the preceding saline injection period in ventricle-injected or dorsal raphe-injected rats. In sharp contrast, VMH-injected rats ate much less food (56 +/- 8% basal) and lost 9 +/- 3 g/day or 5% of their body weight during 3 days of leptin administration. VMH-injected animals fully recovered from leptin-induced effects within 3 days. We conclude that small doses of leptin that do not effect eating behavior when delivered to the ventricle or the dorsal raphe (another brain region believed to regulate feeding), suppress food intake when injected into the VMH. These data suggest that the VMH or a brain region in close proximity to it is a key target for the biological actions of leptin.",
